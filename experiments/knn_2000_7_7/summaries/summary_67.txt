elizabeth the first is considered one of the greatest rulers in england's history if not the greatest for women. She never married can you blame her i mean look at what she grew up with around her dad and all of those moms and stepmoms she never had any kids which that causes a problem come her end time okay where we have i don't have an heir so she eventually does set on a cousin up in scotland which is the country on the same island of england but right above it.
