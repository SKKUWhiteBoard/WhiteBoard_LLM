This week in week three, we're actually going to have some human language, and so this lecture has no partial derivative signs in it. In assignment three, what you're doing is building a neural dependency parser. And so we hope that you can put together what you learned about neural networks last week and the content of today, and jump straight right in to building the neural dependency parsers. And since I missed my office hours yesterday, I'm gonna have a shortened office hour tomorrow from 1:00 to 2:20. neural transition based dependency parsers. We sort of have gone down that we've halve that error-error rate. And we're now down to sort of about a five percent error rate. Yeah. I'm basically out of time now but there is further work including, you know, at Stanford. It's more accurate than 95 percent, right? So we- we're still going on but I think I'd better stop here today, um, and that's neural dependency parsing. [NOISE]. "What can go wrong?" is a way of saying, ''What can't go wrong?' "So, here, is a newspaper article. Uh, ''San Jose cop kills man with knife''. Um, now, this has two meanings and the two meanings, um, depend on, well, what you decide depends on what, you know, what modifies what?" "Once you start having a lot of things that have choices like this, you stop having- if I wanna put an analysis ac- on to this sentence I've to work out the right structure"
