The federal workforce is being reduced at a faster pace than was called for by the Workforce Restructuring Act. DOD, though subject to the actâ€™s governmentwide FTE ceilings, has the authority, under earlier legislation, to offer buyouts through September 30, 1999. The costs and savings of buyouts and RIFs were analyzed using past studies by us, the Congressional Rifs and demographic data from the CPDF. By the end of fiscal year 1997, nearly 53,000 FTE positions were below the ceiling called for in the act.
