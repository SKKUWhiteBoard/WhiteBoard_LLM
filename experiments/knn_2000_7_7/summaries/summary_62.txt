Lecturer: We can take a two by two Hamiltonian and exactly diagonalize it. In the next lecture, we'll look at non-degenerate perturbation theory. The next lecture will be on the interactions between normal modes of a polyatomic molecule and an ordinary, ordinary,harmonic oscillator. The lecture will also look at the effect of the structural parameters in this Hamiltonian on the energy levels and properties of the system. It will be presented by Robert Field, a spectroscopist and professor at MIT.
