There are three common uses of a rotation matrix. The first is to represent an orientation. The second is to change the frame of reference of a vector. And the third is to rotate a vector or frame. To demonstrate these, I will use these three coordinate frames, representing the same space with different orientations. To help you visualize these frames in 3 dimensions, I’ll use my handy tinkertoy frame. This is the z-axis, this is the x-axis and the y-axis. If you premultiply by R, the rotation axis is interpreted as the z-axis of the frame of the first subscript, {s}. You end up with a rotated frame {c-prime}, still expressed in {s]. If you postmultiply R, you get a different rotated frame  c-double-prime. In the next video, we will learn how to represent the angular velocity of a frame. In summary, a rotation matrix has three uses: representing an orientation, changing a frame of reference of a vector or a frame, and rotating a vector.
