Cybersecurity is a cross-cutting field that affects many government and non-governmental stakeholders. For example, the U.S. military views cyberspace as a warfighting domain as well as a force enabler. For the Department of Defense, cybersecurity takes on an offensive or defensive national security role. For purposes of this report, cybersecurity is broadly defined as the protection of critical information infrastructure and its processes and content. It should be noted that some of the apparent gaps discovered may actually be addressed by existing classified programs. President Obama announced the creation of a new cabinet-level position to coordinate cybersecurity strategy and policy across the federal government. While every department and agency has an individual and collective role in securing federal cyber enterprises, some organizations have appeared to have greater authority and capability than others. Common themes often noted by many cybersecurity experts underscore a lack of transparency and dearth of defined roles and responsibilities in addressing cyber-related issues. Such concerns often assert that a continuation of addressing cyber incidents as a individual agency's responsibility will eventually lead to increased national vulnerabilities.
