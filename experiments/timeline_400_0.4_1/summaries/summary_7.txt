As a nurse you want to be familiar with heart blocks and in this review i'm going to be talking about third degree heart blocks also known as a complete heart block. The reason is occurring is because electrical signal from the atria isn't making it to the ventricles. The person could be born with it so it could be congenital or the person has severe heart disease or they have a myocardial infarction or they're taking some type of medication that they become toxic on like digoxin.
