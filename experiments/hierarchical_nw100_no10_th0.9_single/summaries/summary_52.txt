En Route System (ERS) airfields provide critical air component for U.S. defense strategy. ERS provides capabilities needed to handle peacetime operations and smaller-scale contingency operations. According to DODâ€™s January 2001 estimate, the 13 ERS airfields would not currently have enough capacity to move the required amounts of personnel and equipment to the war zones. DOD expects the shortfall to be largely eliminated by 2005, but the assumptions and modeling approach DOD uses in its calculations raise some uncertainty about the precise size of the shortfall.
