Most Navy ships procured since the late 1950s have been funded in accordance with the full funding policy. Full funding policy means that DOD cannot contract for the construction of a new weapon or piece of equipment until funding for the entire cost of that item has been approved by Congress. Congress's decision on ship funding approaches could also affect future Navy capabilities, annual Navy funding requirements, and the shipbuilding industrial base. The issue for Congress is whether to maintain current practices for funding Navy ship procurement or change them by increasing the use of incremental funding.
