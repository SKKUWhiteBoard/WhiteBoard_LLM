Ka-Yen: "I walked into MIT not knowing a single thing about nuclear energy" "I'm going to be talking about the functionality and the benefits and the problems associated nuclear" "In 1951, the first nuclear reactor to produce electricity was the experimental breeder reactor, the EDR1" "From 1975 to 2002, there was this huge boom in nuclear energy, which is about this little chunk over here" "You can see that nothing really happened between the 90s and the 2000s"
