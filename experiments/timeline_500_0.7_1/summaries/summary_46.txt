in this video we're going to discuss what externalities are in economics. An externality is when you do something that affects the well-being or the good of another person or a company but you're neither harmed or rewarded for what you did to that person so the externalities can be positive they can be negative. A negative exTERNality is where you've harmed someone you've done something to somehow impose a cost on someone or some some company or something and you haven't reimbursed that person. it's as a tangent it's actually helping some other person or people and so but those people aren't turning around and compensating you for it right so you're doing something good uh you're you're helping yourself but it has this side benefit of it helps other people as well. If you were actually paid if people said hey I really like what you did you might be more likely to get a flu shot. If your neighbor is trying to sell their house they have a for sale sign up they might appreciate if you went out and really did a great job maintaining your home. where you have a negative externality like pollution or something like that it would be overs supplied relative to what is socially efficient or optimal. Where you have an over-supply of something like pollution, for example, you would have it over supplied in a way that would be socially efficient and optimal. For example, if you have pollution, it would have to be over supplied to avoid it becoming a problem. This would be a way to reduce the amount of pollution or other negative externalities in the environment.
