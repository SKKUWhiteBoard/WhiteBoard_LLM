A random variable is a number that's produced by a random process. In physics, the number of alpha particles detected by a Geiger counter in a second is believed to be a random number. The number of faulty pixels in a monitor is also produced from an unpredictable randomness in the manufacturing process. The only time that C is not greater than or equal to 1 is when you have all tails, so there's a 7/8 chance, 7 out of 8 outcomes involve 1 or more heads. A random variable is not a variable, it's a function that maps the sample space to the real numbers. Usually this would be a real valued random variable. We have another concept of independence that holds for random variables that was motivated by the definition of independence for events. If I have an event A, I can package A into a random variable, just like the match random variable was really packaging the event that the coins matched into a [? 0-1 ?] valued variable. And it means everything that matters about event A is captured by the random variable IA.
