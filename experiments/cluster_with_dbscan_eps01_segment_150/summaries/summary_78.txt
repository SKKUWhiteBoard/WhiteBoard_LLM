dt. So when a particle's undergoing circular motion, it has a velocity that you can describe, which is the tangential motion around the circle. And it also has an angular velocity, which we define as being in a direction that's perpendicular to that direction of rotation. And so this is another way that we can write the velocity and connect it back to the angular velocity. And now that we have defined this omega z, the component of the angular Velocity, we can rewrite the velocity as just being equal to r times omega z still in that theta hat direction. For a particle traveling in a circle, we've seen that the velocity can be written as r d theta dt. Let's now look at rotation in an arbitrary plane. And so what we're going to do is use the right hand rule to define a direction that tells you both the direction it defines the plane and it also tells you what the positive direction of rotation is for that plane. Now, in the k hat direction, in this case, I'm going to call it in the arbitrary n hat direction.
