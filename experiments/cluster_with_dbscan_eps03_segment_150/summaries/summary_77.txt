If you have a complex polyhedron, we found general unfoldings. They work. We proved one of them. If you want an edge unfolding, that's the centuries-old open problem. For non-convex polyhedra, we know this is too much to hope for. Even if it's topologically convex, there's not always an edge unfolds. But for general unfolding, we don't know. So today's lecture is actually mostly about these two open problems and different variations of it. compute the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices, something like this picture, except you don't know what it looks like in 3D. You know every edge must be a shortest path. So the edges are some subset of these guys. And so you've got lots of little convex polygons here. We know it must make a convex polyhedron. If it made two, Cauchy's rigidity theorem would tell you that they're the same. So even once you fix the gluing, you know that there's a unique convex realization. Theory of the facet-path: A path that alternates between visiting faces, triangles, and vertices. Professor: It's an open problem for something like a cube where you actually have quadrilateral faces. He says the claim is facet- Paths always exist for any triangulated, connected surface. The theorem works not only for a polyhedron-- it works for any manifold, any sort of locally, two-dimensional thing, he says. "It's useful because then, we'll get to Mickey Mouses, as we'll see"
