In particle physics and in nuclear physics, we use a system called natural units. This system is based on fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics and special relativity. In some examples, we'll use SI, in others, use natural units, such as Heaviside-Lorentz units. We'll use those natural units as we go through class. This will be a discussion in 8.701 on units, and we'll end with a question-and-answer session on the use of SI units. equals m c squared and all those things, m, E, and also the momentum have the same unit. That simplifies quite a bit. You might think that you lose information by setting fundamental constants to 1, but you actually do not, because you carry with you, in your equations, the dimension of the problem. If you want to do a quick exercise here, I invite you to calculate the charge radius of the proton, which is 4.1 over GeV, or per GeV. always be clear from the problem we're looking at.
