The key word is feasibility technology. It represents the feasibilities that the combination of inputs and outputs, that can be achieved in this world even the current level of technology. The second is no free lunch. At least 1 input is required to produce some output, or more than you know more than 1 kind of output. Third is non reversibility, what it means is that a production process cannot be reversed. So, if you obtain half kg of curd from 1 kg of milk, you cannot obtain 1kg of milk from half kg. Student: To produce 1 kg of rice ok, you need either let us say 100 grams of fertilizer or 50 liters of water. We need land, but that is fixed those are fixed, we are not talking about it only these 2 are variables. Student: On average we are saying this is what it is not always true, but I am saying on average, what we can do is that we can produce 1kg of rice here, using t by 100 and 1 minus t by100, 2 comma 1. If y bar and y bar dash both are feasible, then what additivity says that y bar plus y bar hat is also feasible, is it clear. How we can explain it if it's possible to produce it is possible to have this production plan. Let us say let us take an example y bar is nothing, but 1 2 minus 1 minus 2 comma 1. And next the production process says that seem 1 unit of output can be produced ba using 2 units of input 1 and 2 Units of input 2. same proportion, then output will also decrease in the same proportion and this is possible this is feasible fine. The easier is easier way easier although they these two are not same, but the similar 1 implies the other, but not the other way around. The combination is all given here and this exhibits convexity. Here we are not concerned about the amount of output, what we feasible here, y is taking care of not only inputs but also output. It is also possible to combine lambda x 1 to lambda x 2 of course.
