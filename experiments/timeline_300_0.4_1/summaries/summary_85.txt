Researchers have confirmed a second smaller space Rock smashed into the sea off the coast of West Africa creating a large crater during the same era. Scientists say it would have caused a tsunami at least 800 M High to tear across the Atlantic Ocean. The asteroid that's believed to have wiped them out 66 million years ago was not the only one researchers have confirmed. The discovery is exciting that it happens to be potentially close to the same time as the chicku event known to be the the main cause of the extinction event that killed the dinosaurs.
