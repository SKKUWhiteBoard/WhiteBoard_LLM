50 years ago, John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky coined the term artificial intelligence. Progress has been made, especially in the last 20 years. I think it's a golden age for intelligent applications, if people want to make a lot of money with useful things. But this is kind of engineering. Interesting one, but engineering. And we are working on it. And so, this was the people that we put together from different labs, from neuroscience, from computer science, from cognitive science, and from a number of institutions in the US. still very far from understanding how people can answer questions about images. This is one of the main focus in the center, really. We want to have a system that does it in the same way as our brain does it. And we want to compare your model, our system, with measurements on the brain of people, or monkeys, also during the same task. So that's what we call Turing plus, plus questions. And part of the rationale about it is, this is kind of a more philosophical discussion. looking at the face. And make models of what's going on. And, of course, we want these models to respect the neural data, ideally the MRI data. And do the job of recognizing faces as well as human do. So we are getting there. I'm not saying we have the answers, but we have at least models that can be tested at all these different levels. So that's kind of the ideal situation, from the point of view of what we want to do in the center.
