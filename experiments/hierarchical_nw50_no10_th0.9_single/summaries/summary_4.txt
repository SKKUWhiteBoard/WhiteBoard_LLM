At the end of July 2010, over 10,000 military medical personnel were deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. DOD has established five levels of medical care to treat injured or sick military personnel. Each level provides area to the continental United States, with each level providing progressively more intensive treatment. The United Statesâ€™ military presence in Iraq is scheduled to end no later than December 31, 2011, and, according to administration estimates, about 104,000 U.S. military personnel are deployed in Afghanistan.
