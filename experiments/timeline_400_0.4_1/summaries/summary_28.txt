A random variable is a number that's produced by a random process. The number of faulty pixels in a monitor is also produced from an unpredictable randomness. The event that C equals 1, that's an event that-- it's a set of outcomes where the count is 1 and it has a certain probability. There are 3 possible outcomes among the 8 outcomes of heads and tails with 3 coins. The probability that C greater than or equal to 1 is 7/8. And when the outcome is translated into a real number that you think of as being produced as a random variable, it's what the random variable does.
