In this problem, we are given a joint PDF for x and y. And then we are asked to compute the variance of x plus y. We're told we should compute this variance by using something called the law of total variance. So first, I want to focus on this term-- the conditional expectation of X plus y conditioned on x. So this is actually just x plus the expectation of y given x. And because it's uniformly distributed and because expectation acts like center of mass, we know that the expectation should be the midpoint.  memorizing formulas might seem like cheating, but there's a few important ones you should know. And it will help you sort of become faster at doing computations. And that's important, especially if you guys take the exams. So that's it. See you next time.
