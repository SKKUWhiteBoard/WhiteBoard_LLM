ERS airfields provide the primary “throughput” services for aircraft as they move from U.S. bases through ERS airfields and on to their eventual destinations at bases located in or near the war zones. ERS bases were used extensively during recent operations in Kosovo. According to DOD’s January 2001 estimate, in the event of overlapping major theater wars in Korea and Southwest Asia, the 13 E RS airfields would not currently have enough capacity to move the required amounts of personnel and equipment to war zones in the time required.
