Of the over 83,000 chemicals currently in the TSCA inventory, about 62,000 were already in commerce when EPA began reviewing chemicals in 1979. Since then, over 21,000 new chemicals were added to the inventory and are now in use as existing chemicals. If EPA finds that a chemicalâ€™s risks are unreasonable, it can prohibit or limit its production, processing, distribution, use, and disposal. The EU recently revised its chemical control policy through legislation known as Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals.
