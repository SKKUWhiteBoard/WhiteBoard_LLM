The Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-226) placed annual ceilings on executive branch full-time equivalent (FTE) positions from fiscal years 1994 through 1999. To help accomplish this downsizing, the act allowed non-Department of Defense (DOD) executive branch agencies to pay buyouts. As of September 30, 1995, more than 112,500 buyouts had been paid governmentwide. The federal workforce is being reduced at a faster pace than was called for by the act.
