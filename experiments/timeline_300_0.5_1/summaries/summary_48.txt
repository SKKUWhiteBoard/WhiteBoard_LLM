Ahern: I have never had an exam where I had fewer questions. There were maybe 10 questions I got on the exam and that was for a class of this side. I find most students are honest. I've only had a handful of situations where in this class, where I've had dishonesty as an issue. The only students I've ever had with serious dishonesty issues actually were in smaller classes interestingly enough. But it has happened here and I do have taped evidence when it does happen. So that's why I do it. S1 proteases are a class of enzymes that are called serine proteases. They all have serine, histidine, and aspartic acid as a catalytic triad at the active site. It's very easy to alter the genetic code for any of these proteases and change which amino acid is presence at any given place. When they do that, and they compare the activity, so this is the log of Kcat. The wild type enzyme has an activity up here. One 10 millionth as active when that serine is changed to an alanine. Business of creating nucleophiles is not unique to proteases. One of these is an enzyme we've been talking about some already, that's the carbonic anhydrase. Students: Would you like a joke? Ahern: Yeah. Okay, so let's stretch. So this my, this is my magic genie joke, alright? This is not a computer joke. Depends on where you lean, I suppose. "This is really awesome, "I'm a really powerful guy. "I want every woman to love me." and poof, he turns into a box of chocolates. Carbonic anhydrase can catalyze the conversion of a million molecules of substrate into product per second. Most enzymes have a fairly narrow pH range where they work that's ideal. At pH 9, the enzyme is far more active than it is at pH 7, indicating that a very, very important step is the removal of that proton. The rate of formation of the nucleophile is the critical step in the catalytic action of this enzyme like that of the proteases that you saw before.
