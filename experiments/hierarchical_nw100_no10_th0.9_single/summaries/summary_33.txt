Several key sources provide information on the number and characteristics of working children. The Current Population Survey (CPS) provides data on where children work, the types of jobs they hold, and how many hours a week they work. The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) contains data on one group of approximately 9,000 children born from 1980 to 1984. The second set is the National Agricultural Workers Survey in which data are collected several times each year from a sample of crop agricultural workers. Once children reach age 16, under the age of 18, they are prohibited from working in jobs covered by these Hazardous Occupations Orders.
