The focus of patent examination is to determine whether the invention in a patent application satisfies the legal requirements for a patent. As of May 2015, USPTO had nearly 8,300 patent examiners across the eight technology centers we reviewed. Examiners are expected to complete their examination of an application in a certain number of hours. The allotted time includes the time needed to review the application, perform a search for prior art, and complete all office actions. For example, an examiner reviewing an application related to wire fabrics and structure may be allotted about 14 hours for examination.
