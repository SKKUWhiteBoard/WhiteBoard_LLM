Researchers have confirmed a second smaller space Rock smashed into the sea off the coast of West Africa creating a large crater during the same era. It would have been a catastrophic event and scientists say it would have caused a tsunami at least 800 M High to tear across the Atlantic Ocean. It's exciting that it happens to be potentially close to the same time as the chicku event 66 million years ago known to be the the main cause of the extinction event that killed the dinosaurs and 75% of life on Earth absolutely fascinating. meters of water it hit would have generated a pretty significant tsunami. It may not have been a global event however it wouldn't have been large enough to have say caused a global catastrophe in the way that chicks Loop did. It's worth saying we don't know the exact timing because it hasn't yet been drilled H really interesting. It could have occurred at a similar time and and it's worth say weDon't know exactly when it happened. It was in the early hours of the morning on the morning of September 11, 2001.
