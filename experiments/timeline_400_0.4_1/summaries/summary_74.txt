This lesson will first dive into some signal Theory and then move on into things that we're more familiar with things like deconvolutions and using Transformers for next note prediction. The first thing we want to talk about is how can we sample and quantize a continuous time signal. We then go into some geometric signal Theory with Transformers and finally how how we can kind of generate sounds using these. The next thing we're going to kind oftalk about is changing forms. We'll talk about the SARS ADC algorithm and how it's used to convert digital signals to analog. things a try yourself uh yeah thank you guys for tuning in have a good one. Things you might want to try yourself. Things that you may want to give a try. uh yeah. things you might be interested in trying yourself. things that you might like to give yourself. uhYeah. things a try yourselves. uh Yeah. Things a try themselves. Things your might like yourself.things you may like to do yourself. thanks you guys. for tuning into this week's episode of The Daily Discussion.
