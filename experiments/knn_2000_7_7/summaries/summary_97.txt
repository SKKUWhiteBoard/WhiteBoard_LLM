Chess has been known as a tool of military strategy, a metaphor for human affairs, and a benchmark of genius. The game was originally known as chaturanga– a Sanskrit word for "four divisions" With its spread to Sassanid Persia, it acquired its current name and terminology– "chess," derived from "shah," meaning king. Chess-playing computers had been developed for decades, but Deep Blue’s triumph over Garry Kasparov in 1997 was the first time a machine had defeated a sitting champion.
