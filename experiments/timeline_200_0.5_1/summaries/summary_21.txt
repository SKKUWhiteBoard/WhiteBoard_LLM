Simple graphs are directed graphs where the arrows have a beginning and an end. A directed graph might have a self loop, an edge that starts and begins at the-- starts and ends at the same vertices. A simple graph has a nonempty set, v of vertices, and it has a set E of edges, but the edges now are somewhat different since they don't have beginnings and ends. An edge just has two endpoints that are in V, and we don't distinguish the endpoints. Study: Men have 30% more partners than women, according to the US Department of Health. David Frum: "We're going to come up with a very elementary graph theoretic argument that says that this is complete nonsense" He says there is a fixed relationship between the average number of partners of men, the average degree of the M vertices and the average degrees of the F vertices. Frum says the answer seems to be that people are lying about the number of women and men.
