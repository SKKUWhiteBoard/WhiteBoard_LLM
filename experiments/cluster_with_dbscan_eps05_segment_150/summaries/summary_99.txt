Third lecture on Foundation mulative AI. Next time we'll talk about stable diffusion image generation. We'll have two guest speakers and then we'll end with the lecture on AI ethics and regulation as well as a panel. We apply this self-supervised learning where we learn without label data so we can get as much data as we want because there's no human being in the loop. There's no limit how much we can scale this up and what we get from this by learning from observation and learning from the data directly is a very contextual understanding of meaning. the World by looking at videos right you can even sort to understand how human beings work even better because you can see people being upset or sad or happy whatever right in in a video and start picking these cues up. You can connect the vision part to the text part and get a multimodality model that's able to do both in a really really sophisticated way uh also something that I think these these people are working on all right thank you thank you for your time and good luck with your book. Force things to comply to Simple Rules right it kind of abandons our ability to understand and compress what we're seeing and deals with that chaos directly that's why AI is so powerful and so humanlike. CTP was trained at a scale with an amount of data and parameters that we never seen before so this is a a year old now but this is I think this was 3.5 or something the first version it was using 175 billion parameters and just training the the final model cost around $5 million just in in Compu electricity bills.
