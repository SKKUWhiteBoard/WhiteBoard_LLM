HONG LIU: Today, we talk about chiral fermions. He says the Dirac equation requires, actually, psi to have four components. But there are two ways to reduce it, and one is called the Majorana fermion, he says. HONG LIu: You don't need four components to be able to transform under Lorentz. You just need a smaller unit, OK? He says this tells you that at least two components already can transform. HONG LIU: We already knew all along that two components is enough for Lorentz transformation. How do we actually know all along? AUDIENCE: Is it the massless particle? HONG LIu: Yeah, exactly. So it is the mass which is the key. So, now, we have shown in this particular representation of gamma matrices, for this particular choice of gammaMatrices, and then the psi transform block diagonally. But then we also said, but, now,. consider a different choice of GammaMatrices. And then this property will not hold. HONG LIU: So, by definition, discrete symmetries are symmetry, which don't have continuous parameters. So for a complex scalar field, then this is no longer a discrete symmetry because, remember, we can rotate phi by a phase. You can exchange phi to phi star, OK? It's a complex conjugation. So often, this will give a symbol-- T, T-- and heuristically we can think of phi as creating one particle and one antiparticle.
