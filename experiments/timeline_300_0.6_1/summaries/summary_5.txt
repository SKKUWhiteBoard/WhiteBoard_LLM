50 years ago, John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky coined the term artificial intelligence. The idea of merging brain research and computer science in the quest to understand intelligence. This was the people that we put together from different labs, from neuroscience, from computer science, from cognitive science, and from a number of institutions in the US. Let me tell you a bit more about the background here. Part of the reason for this was progress and convergence we saw between different disciplines. And one of them was progress in AI. And this started, really, with Deep Blue, I guess it was called. I think it's a golden age for intelligent applications. We are still very far from understanding how people can answer questions about images. It's not enough to pass the Turing Test. We want to have a system that does it in the same way as our brain does it. And we want to compare your model, our system, with measurements on the brain of people, or monkeys, also during the same task. So we are not yet at the point in which we can answer all those kind of questions at all these different levels. But some, we are.
