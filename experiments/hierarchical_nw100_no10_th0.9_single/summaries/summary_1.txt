In 1995, over 9,000 foreign physicians with J-1 visas were in the United States for graduate medical education or training. The number of waivers being processed for physicians to practice in underserved areas each year has grown from 70 in 1990, to 1,374 in 1995. Waiver physicians are practicing in virtually every state; most are primary care physicians. Indications are that in 1995, about half of the foreign physicians that were supposed to return home were granted waivers of this requirement.
