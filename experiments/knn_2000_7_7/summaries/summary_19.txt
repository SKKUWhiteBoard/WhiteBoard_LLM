Professor: We're going to start with a short review problem on rugged landscapes. Then we'll get into the core topic of the class, which is evolutionary game theory. We'll discuss why it is that you don't need to invoke any notion of rationality. And we'll say something about the evolution of cooperation and experiments that one can do with microbial populations in the laboratory.
