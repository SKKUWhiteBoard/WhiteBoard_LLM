you want to look at those p waves make sure that they are normal. Make sure that there is only one p wave in front of every qrs complex and make sure they're upright. With sinus hack the atrial rate is going to be greater than 100 beats per minute and then whenever you're looking at the p wave take your calipers and go from p wave to p wave and make make sure there's the same distance between those because that means it's occurring at a regular interval. Sustained sinus tachycardia can actually decrease cardiac output in your patient. As a nurse we want to assess for any potential causes for why our patient is running this rhythm. The patient can wear a halter monitor if they're at home having this and this will monitor their rhythm and then it'll go back to the cardiologist who will read can be ordered to bring down the fever and then the nurse's role is to report the rhythm change to the physician and let them know about it. cool extremities and then you want to teach the patient if you're able to avoid any activities that could further increase their sinus tag like if they're smoking or drinking caffeine or using any other stimulants because we don't want their heart rate to get up any higher okay so that wraps up this review over sonos tachycardia.

The sa node is located in the upper part of the right atrium. It is the starting point of the electrical conduction system. The sa node acts as the pacemaker of the heart. If it's working like it should it should cause your heart to beat at about 60 to 100 beats per minute. The reason this rhythm is occurring is because our sa node was firing rapidly and it's causing this heart to beating rapidly. The heart will start beating fast because it knows that the body is in dire need of oxygen.
