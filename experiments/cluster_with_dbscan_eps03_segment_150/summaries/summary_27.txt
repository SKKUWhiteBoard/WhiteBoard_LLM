The fundamental theorem of calculus can be used to solve any differential equation. The product rule says take the derivative of [INAUDIBLE] that is e to the minus t is one. So the two terms from the product rule are the two term in the differential equation, which is dy dt. The derivative of that product is one term will be y and the otherterm will be q. That's a remarkable formula for the solution to a basic differential equation and it's a key example in differential equations. this isn't so practical. Tangent parabola, quite practical. Higher order terms, less-- much less practical. But the formula is beautiful because you see the pattern, that's really what mathematics is about. They all fit that pattern and when you add up all the terms, if you have a nice function, then the approximation becomes perfect and you would have equality. And those are the best functions of mathematics and exponential is of course one of them. OK that's calculus. Well, part of calculus. GILBERT STRANG: Differential equations is the big application of calculus. He says it's interesting to see what information and ideas from calculus actually get used in differential equations. Strang: You really do need to know basic derivatives. The derivative of e to the x, which is e toThe x. The fundamental theorem involves the derivative and the integral, he says. He shows you how to take into account the bending of a curve to get closer to the point where the derivative is close to the original.
