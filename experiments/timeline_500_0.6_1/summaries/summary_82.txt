There are three common uses of a rotation matrix. The first is to represent an orientation. The second is to change the frame of reference of a vector. And the third is to rotate a vector or frame. To demonstrate these, I will use these three coordinate frames, representing the same space with different orientations. To help you visualize these frames in 3 dimensions, I'll use my handy tinkertoy frame. In the next video, we will learn how to represent the angular velocity of a frame.
