Maybe there are some celebrities nowadays who are just so weird that they borderline genius in a way just because they're so out there and there's people that come about that are justso unlike Walter Scott and Walter Scott. I don't know what it is, but there's something about him that makes him more interesting to me than the rest of these people. I just don't understand it. I'm like, 'What is it about him?' anything else that we've seen before that it's almost like a new art form does that kind of make sense? He was an individual who you know was into art and was into eventually you know religion and such. He was a person who was a little bit different from other people he knew, he says. He says he's never seen anything like it. "I've never seen something like it," he adds. "It's a new form of art. It's like a different art form" became a big part of his life but his as an artist you know he was a very prolific poet but he was also big-time into painting. We'll see some of his paintings later on but also a new type of art form kind of relief fetching where you kind of stand on one foot and look down on the other foot with your arms out in front of you. That was a new kind of artform. That's a new art form. It's very exciting. We're looking forward to it. of sketch out a negative of what you should have and what I mean by that if you have a photograph negative the black of the darks or the whites and whites of the box that type of thing and so he can kind of do that same thing but he can also sketch out what he should have in the negative. He can do the same thing in a film negative as well. He sketches out the black and white of the negative of the film negative. The negative can then be used in the film to create the negative image. fetching into a metal which would be a long long time and so he fetches out these scenes he edges in his poems into it and so it takes a lot of time a very time-consuming as it says. That's why on that page it talks about how it can be done in a very short amount of time. It's a long way of saying that it's a very long process. It takes a long time to do a poem like that. It can take a long, long time. So that's why it's so long. be the most some of the most valuable pieces of literary history that that have survived. You'll see some pictures of some of those etchings later on but in essence you know some of your money is relief itched stamped you know they have plates that are the reflected and you'll see that later on in this article.

I'm so in art form that he kind of really pushes, he said. He said he was so real and that he was in the art form of illuminated printing. He called it "illuminated printing" and said it was a form of art form called "illuminated printing" the boundaries on and really became the form the more bear of it and a front-runner so very interesting individual and just just out there mentally. "Not that we with the stuff we read today isn't gonna be like man that guy was weird it's just his personality," he says. "Just that not that we ... don't think he's weird. It's just that not ... he's just a very interestingindividual and just out of there mentally," he adds. "It's just ... his personality" is so different from some of those just normal people that we read about that it's like everybody else this guy would probably be a rock star nowadays. "For whatever his profession would be he probably would just be out there and everybody just thinks it's funny okay" "He's so different," he says. "I'm so different. I'm so different from some of these just normal people that we read about that it's like everybody else" and he's a very successful person so it was Williams like just very interesting guy these individuals Blake and will do Wordsworth later and Coolridge and all of these people these are answers on Jeopardy. So when you're flipping through and you just stop because oh there's an English question, these are the answers for you. It's a great way to start the day. It was a great start to the day for me. I was very excited. I've been looking forward to it for a while. and your parents don't know just throw out William Blake you might be right okay very very very famous individual so we'll be covering in the next couple days the lamb by William Blake. Little lamb who made thee thus thou know who made the life and bid thee gave the life, bid thee.

God bless him, little lamb. this is probably the sweetest of the poems that we have to some degree okay looking at it at face value one they have a little picture and these are the the etchings that he does okay you know with the picture that they give us to to help place. This is one of the most beautiful poems that I've ever read. It's one of his most famous poems. It was written in the early 1800s. He wrote it in the style of a sonnet. things you know we have a shepherd talking to his flock okay he's out there alone he's probably has conversations with them I don't know they might be very lonely the little man little manlittle lamb who made thee thus thou know who made thy life who gave thee life. The little man is a little lamb. He's a little man, he's a lamb. Who made thee so and so and who made him so? Who made him thus and thus?

And so it is with the Lamb of the Forest. ultimately about God made you little lamb God madeYou he gave you these things. He gave you your clothes he gaveYou that little voice that you have. He is called by thy name so he calls himself a lamb so Jesus God religion okay you are created by. God God religionOkay you areCreated by God God created you as a lamb. You are created as a little lamb by God. He made you. He called you a lamb by calling you a name. You were created by God to be a lamb and to be called by his name. those things and you have been given those things he is meek in his mild he became a little child I a child and thou a lamb we are called by his name so even though I'm a man and you're a lamb, we are we are the same okay. okay even though we're different, we're still the same. okay.those things. and you've been given. those things. He's meek, he's mild. he's a child. I'm meek. He is mild. He became alittle child. At my church they uh the little kids they caught they go off and they're called like little flocks their little rooms or flocks of sheep you know and and little thing. Now could the lamb be a symbol for something else could it? I don't know about you but at my church the little children they caught are called likelittle flocks. They're called  flock of sheep. And and little things like that. So could it be a sign of something else? I'm not sure. little lambs and such I look at this as a little bit deeper or it could be alittle bit deeper yes we have you know the nature the common man of the shepherd and such but I like to put in a littlebit about the child as well as well. We have the nature of the Shepherd and such and such. We also have the child and such as well, and so on and so forth. It's a bit of a mix of all of those things. It could be deeper. could you see how this could be some instructor talking to little kids for every one of these lambs little lamb little child do you know who gave you your little voice who gaveYou your little clothes do youknow let me tell you let meTell you about. Could you seeHow this could Be some instructor Talking to Little kids for Every One of These lambs. Do you knowwho gave you you little voice. Who gave youyour little clothes. Who did you know let me Tell you about? him he is of this name you and I are the same you and blah blah blah so I mean you could see this being told to a kid you know for Sunday School and you can see thisbeing told to somebody you know or or something out in the world. It's a great story. I mean it could be told to someone you know. It could be used to tell a story about someone you're close to or something like that. It would be great to hear it from someone I know. the field but somebody that is passionate about their religion and their faith you know the nature and the common man the shepherd person of the flock or even a child in a sense of children. So it's a very short one and it's one that I believe is pretty pretty. It's one of the things that I think is pretty special about my life. I'm very proud to have been a part of it and I hope to continue to do so in the future. I hope that one day I will be able to give back to the church. easy to to comprehend and understand okay okay okay. easy to to understand and understandable okay. okay to comprehend, understand okay.
