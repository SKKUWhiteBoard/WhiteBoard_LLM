Congress has enacted several laws to assist agencies and the federal government in managing IT investments. About 8.5 percent of federal agenciesâ€™ planned spending for fiscal year 2016 has gone toward provisioned IT services, leaving the vast majority of spending going toward IT that is non-provisioned. The federal government has spent billions of dollars on failed and poorly performing IT investments which often suffered from ineffective management, such as project planning, requirements definition, and program oversight and governance. In the last 6 years, we made approximately 800 recommendations to agencies to improve the transparency and oversight of underperforming IT investments and manage more effectively.
