Michael Short talks about radiation damage and nuclear materials. He explains the different material properties and what they actually mean. Short will be giving a talk at MRS, a materials research conference tomorrow. The talk will be on radiation damage in nuclear materials, which is the biggest research field in MIT's physics department. The course is free and available to the public.

Pretty tricky spot that we're in, huh? But we're trying to science our way out of it. I don't want to keep you longer, but I'll open on Thursday with a little story about how mass attenuation coefficients can get you out of apartheid South Africa. I'm serious. And then we'll move into dose and biological effects. It's a couple minutes after. Well, it was just a few minutes. energy E and imparting kinetic energy T to another struck atom? That comes right from-- remember our treatment-- I think I've drawn this probably 50 times now. You then multiply by this little function nu of T, which represents the amount of damage, or not just ranting against it, no I am, but I'm doing so with evidence, so it's justified. These folks took pure nickel and put it in the same reactor, at the same temperature, and got the same amount of swelling. All the conditions were the same.
