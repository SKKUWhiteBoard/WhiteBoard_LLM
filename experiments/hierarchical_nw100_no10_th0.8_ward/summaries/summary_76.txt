A banking entity's ownership interest in a covered fund will be considered an "other similar interest" if the banking entity has any of the following: control over the removal or hiring of covered fund's managers, directors, or investment advisors. A right to share in acovered fund's "income, gains, or profits"; 3. a right, other than rights as a creditor upon a default or acceleration trigger, to a covered Fund's assets "after all other interests have been redeemed and/or paid in full"; 4. a "right to receive all or a portion of excess spread" of a coveredFund. services"; (2) "the fund is organized and offered only in connection with bona fide trust, fiduciary, or investment advisory services"; (3) the banking entity retains only a de minimis interest in the funds; (4) the Banking entity and its affiliates engage in no transaction with the fund that would be designated as a "covered transaction" under Federal Reserve Act (FRA) Section 23A; (5) the covered fund does not have the word "bank" in its name or share a name with the banking entities. as if the banking entity were a member bank and the fund an affiliate of that bank.

No director or employee of the banking. entity, other than those directly engaged in providing investment advisory or other services to the covered. fund, acquires an interest in the fund. Although not explicitly excepted by the statute, pursuant to the regulations, banking entities generally may engage in underwriting and market making activities for covered funds. Final regulations establish how tier 1 capital should be calculated for those banking entities that are not otherwise required to maintain and report capital levels. The Volcker Rule authorizes banking entities to acquire ownership interests in, sponsor, organize, and offer covered funds to the extent that the banking entity provides "bona fide trust, fiduciary, or investment advisory services" Banking entities are permitted to make initial seed investments to establish covered funds and help make them become attractive investments for unaffiliated third parties, but to do so they must comply with the aggregate de minimis investment requirements. A de minimis investment made by a banking entity and its affiliates must "not exceed 3 percent of the total number or value of the outstanding ownership interests of the fund" The FRB may provide up to two additional years to conform with the per fund de minimi cap if such an extension "would be consistent with safety and soundness and not detrimental to the public interest" Certain SEC-registered business development companies, investment companies, and foreign public funds generally are excluded from the definition of "covered fund" as described above. Volcker Rule prohibits "banking entities" from engaging in "proprietary trading" The Rule carves out numerous exclusions and designates myriad activities as permissible so long as various terms and conditions are met. The Volcker Rule allows banking entities to act as a securitizer or, in accordance with the credit risk retention requirements of Section 15G(a)(3) of the Exchange Act, to hold investments in a covered fund that is an issuer of asset-backed securities. Regulations require banking entities to develop and maintain compliance programs, internal controls, and recordkeeping systems. Compliance requirements vary in accordance with the size of the banking entity, as well as the scope, complexity, and types of trading and investment activities. Banking entities with total assets below $10 billion may fold Volcker Rule compliance measures into existing compliance programs. The standard compliance requirements, which are set forth in Appendix A to the regulations, apply to banking entities with assets of $10 or more. purpose of that law; commodity pools that have an exempt status under CFTC Rule 4.7; CFTC-registered commodity pools, whose participation units are substantially owned by and only offered to certain "qualified eligible persons" in accordance with CFTC regulations. Foreign-based funds that raise money to sell or invest in securities and whose ownership interests are offered and sold exclusively outside the U.S., that either are sponsored by a banking entity or have ownership interests held by the banking entity. Such funds could qualify for an exemption, other than exemptions under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3 (c)(7), from the Investment Company. under Section 3(c)(1), from the Investment Company Act of 1940 if such funds were subject to U.S. securities laws. The rule explicitly excludes a number of activities and products from the "covered fund" definition. These exclusions include the following: Foreign Public Funds. Issuers that are not organized or established in the United States that "issue ownership interests to retail investors in [their] home jurisdiction" and such interests are sold "predominantly through one or more public offerings" The Volcker Rule prohibits banking entities from sponsoring or investing in covered funds. The prohibition does not apply to holding an ownership interest in a covered fund. Banking entities that are organized in a foreign country and are not controlled, either directly or indirectly, by a U.S.-based banking entity may be exempt from the restrictions. All associated activities with and investments in state law permitting such investments "is insufficient to protect the safety and soundness of the banking entity, or the financial stability of the United States," the regulators say. Insurance companies and their affiliates may sponsor or acquire ownership interests in covered funds if those interests are retained solely for the insurance company's or its affiliate's own account. All associated activities with and investments in the covered fund are conducted outside of the U.S., and generally the majority of the banking entity's overall business takes place in a foreign country. Unless the federal banking regulators jointly determined that the state law permitting such investments "is insufficient to protect the public interest," such investments can be made. The regulations apply to banking entities with assets of $10 billion or more. The standard compliance program includes requirements for written policies and procedures. The Enhanced Minimum Standards include instructions as to the specific ingredients of the entity's policies. The final regulations also require and establish methods of calculating quantitative measurements that banking entities must furnish for seven aspects of each trading desk. The preamble to the final regulations make clear, however, that these are not safe harbors for banking entities, but that they have robust measures in place to identify and monitor the risks. instructions as to the specific ingredients of the entity's policies and procedures applicable to its trading desks and to its covered fund activities or investments. For the trading desks of banking entities that are subject to the heightened compliance program, there are specific requirements regarding how the trading desk "identif[ies], authoriz[es], and document[s] financial instruments to be purchased or sold" There are also provisions on describing the firm's risks and risk management process; how it authorizes risks, specific instruments, and products. "market making-related activities" provided there are "clearly defined, verifiable, and monitored risk parameters" The regulation's requirements include that "[t]he amount, types, and risks of the financial instruments ... are designed not to exceed, on an ongoing basis, the reasonably expected near term demands of clients, customers, or counterparties" The banking entity "routinely stands ready to purchase and sell ... financial instruments" in commercially reasonable amounts and on a basis appropriate for the liquidity, maturity, and depth of the market. Regulators may impose additional capital and quantitative limits as "appropriate to protect the safety and soundness of banking entities engaged in such activities" Subject to those conditions, the exceptions or permitted activities are: Underwriting Activities. Market Making Activities. The exemption for underwriting and market making-activities ... by its terms, is a statutorily permitted activity and exemption from the prohibitions in [12 U.S.C. §1851(a)], whether on proprietary trading or on covered fund activities. Banking entities will be required to document any investment undertaken as a hedge by linking it to the specific risks or exposures being offset. This provision is aimed at preventing incidents like the $6 billion loss that JPMorgan & Co. suffered in 2012 as a result of derivatives trades. Banking entities are permitted to take ownership stakes in covered funds for hedging purposes. Such acquisitions are only permissible purposes subject to important limitations. Whether the goal of the agencies for flexibility sufficient to maintain robust capital markets has been achieved, particularly with respect to some specialty markets, awaits time and experience. suffered in 2012 as a result of derivatives trades, designed to hedge against risks of the entire financial conglomerate. The statute authorizes the purchase and sale of U.S. obligations; obligations of federal agencies, Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Federal Home Loan Banks, Farmer Mac, and Farm Credit System institutions. Under the regulations, banking entities may purchase and sell "any municipal security" and "any state or political subdivision of a state" in the same way. The Volcker Rule establishes an outright prohibition on proprietary trading by a "banking entity" But banking entities may purchase and sell "any municipal security" and other domestic government obligations. Proprietary trading does not apply to a banking entity's fiduciary activities that are conducted on behalf a customer and of the United States. The statute provides the agencies with discretion to permit proprietary trading for any other activity that they "determine, by rule, ... would permit promote and protect the safety soundness of the banking entity" Riskless principal transactions, where a banking entity buys or sells a financial product "to offset a contemporaneous sale or purchase" of a customer, are exempt from the Volcker Rule's ban on proprietary trading. Insurance Company Portfolio Investments. The statute permits trading by insurance companies for their general accounts. However, the relevant federal banking regulators, in consultation with the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and relevant state or foreign insurance regulators, may jointly proscribe otherwise permissible insurance company investment activities. The regulation focuses on restricting short-term trades. It establishes a rebuttable presumption that any financial instrument held for fewer than 60 days is a banned proprietary trade. Certain activities are not included in the definition of "proprietary trading," including the following: acquisitions or sales of financial products pursuant to a repurchase and reverse repurchase agreement. Foreign exchange or currency, but not loans, are excluded from the rule. The rule also covers trades by banking entities that are securities dealers and swap or swap-based securities dealers—both in the United States and abroad. "Proprietary trading" covers buying and selling of "financial instruments" by banking entities as "principal" for their "trading accounts" "Financial instruments" include securities, derivatives, and contracts for future sale or for options on any commodity other than foreign exchange or currency, but not loans. The Rule identifies exceptions to the blanket prohibition of proprietary trades by listing permitted activities and setting conditions under which those activities may be conducted. However, it excludes from permitted activities any transaction or class of activities, otherwise permitted, that that is otherwise permitted. reverse repurchase agreement; acquisitions or sales of financial products pursuant to a securities lending agreement; and "highly liquid" securities as part of a valid liquidity management plan. "The banking entity does not reasonably expect to give rise to appreciable profits or losses as a result of short-term price movements"; various derivative clearing activities. "Financial products for the satisfaction of delivery obligations, such as in connection with a judicial or administrative proceeding"; and "by a banking entity acting solely as agent, broker, or custodian" The Volcker Rule broadly defines "ownership interest" to mean "any equity, partnership, or other similar interest" The provision involving the control to hire or remove advisors, managers, and directors has caused some consternation among banking entities. The regulations state that, under certain circumstances, "restricted profit interests" held by a banking entity or one of its current or former employees are not considered an ownership interest for the purposes of the Volcker rule. For example, as a result of the rule, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission may be able to require banks to disclose more information about their clients. savings and loan or thrift holding companies. Foreign-based companies that are treated like bank holding companies pursuant to the International Banking Act of 1978. An affiliate is "any company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with [a company described in categories 1-3]." This includes foreign-based banks that are permitted to operate branches in the U.S. or that own certain other domestic lending companies. In short, an affiliate is a subsidiary of a company that is controlled or controlled by another company. ownership interests in the issuer are sold predominately to persons other than such sponsoring banking entity. Wholly Owned Subsidiaries. Entities that are directly or indirectly owned entirely by the banking entity or one of its affiliates. Joint Ventures.

A separate account established for a banking entity (or multiple banking entities) to acquire life insurance policies for its benefit so long as the banking entity does not control the accounts' investment decisions. "Banking entity" is defined as FDIC-insured depository institutions. Such companies are typically organized as bank holding companies (BHCs) The Volcker Rule generally applies to hundreds of depository and non-depository affiliates and subsidiaries of these FHCs. However, the regulations provide certain exceptions to the definition of "banking entity," as discussed below. The applicability of certain exemptions, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, and other aspects of the Rule vary to some degree according to the organization or typical activities. a variety of regulatory regimes and separate regulators, foreign and domestic. It applies to community and global banks, every variety of insurance firm, securities firms, and foreign banking institutions operating in the United States. The statutory language requires the regulators to explicate such critical terms as "banking entity," "covered fund," "illiquid fund," and "trading account" The Rule includes a broad explicit delegation of discretion to exclude from the basic prohibitions of the statute. It would promote and protect the safety and soundness of the banking entity. activities, while also carving out specific exclusions from the scope of the two categories. These excepted activities are designated as permissible under the Rule unless they would involve or result in a material conflict of interest. The Rule also provides standards by which the regulators may set further limits or conditions on these permissible activities. The regulators may impose additional capital and quantitative limits as "appropriate to protect the safety and soundness of banking entities engaged in such activities," the report says. The report concludes by addressing other aspects of the Rule that apply generally to banking entities. permissible so long as various terms and conditions are met. The statutory language provides only general outlines of prohibited activities and exceptions. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the SEC, and CFTC (together, the federal financial regulators or the Agencies) can issue coordinated rulemakings to fill in the details. The difficult task of crafting regulations to distinguish prohibited activities from activities considered essential to the safety and soundness of banking institutions. Some collateralized debt obligations (CDO) backed by trust preferred securities (TruPS) generally was a prohibited investment under the original Volcker Rule regulations. The American Bankers Association and several community banking organizations promptly filed a lawsuit challenging this aspect of the financial regulators' interpretation of the Volcker rule. The financial regulators responded by issuing an interim final rule on January 14, 2014. Shortly after the regulators issued the interim final rules, the plaintiffs withdrew their lawsuit. Similar issues likely exist regarding the applicability of theVolcker Rule to securities, issued and held by community banks. On December 10, 2013, more than two years after the statutorily mandated deadline, five federal financial regulators published final regulations. The Volcker Rule is designed to prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in risky, short-term, speculative trading and investing in private equity and hedge funds. The same day that the regulations were issued, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) set the date when conformance with the Rule is required as July 21, 2015, although that date could be extended an additional two years. Congress has delegated extensive discretion to the federal financial regulators. The Volcker Rule applies broadly to all depository institutions and most companies that are owned by or have a common ownership interest with a depository. As a result, the rule applies to the approximately 10,000 "community banks" scattered across the country. The rule also generally applies to hundreds of global financial conglomerates like Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs, which are organized as FHCs. recent extension, the conformance date is July 21, 2015. This means that a company that was a banking. entity or a subsidiary or affiliate of a banking entity on July. 21, 2010, must bring its activities into conformance before July 21. 2015. A company becoming a banking entities on July 21,. 2015, thus, would have two years, untilJuly 21, 2017, to conform its activities and investments. Banking entities are expected to engage in good faith efforts to be in compliance with the rules. to terminate the activity and divest the investment promptly. The statute generally requires divestiture of nonconforming activities within two years of the Rule becoming effective. The FRB has authority to extend this two-year period one year at a time, not to exceed an aggregate of three years. Under the FRB's recent extension, the conformance date is July 21, 2015. This subject to the data reporting and recordkeeping requirements of the rule that are discussed in the previous section of this report. five years; at the end of which divestiture would be required either at the. end of the five years or on the contractual date—whichever is earlier. The deal is expected to be completed in the first half of 2015 or in the second half of the year, depending on when the deal is concluded. The price for the deal would be in the region of $2.5 billion to $3.5billion, according to a report by the International Chamber of Commerce in New York.
