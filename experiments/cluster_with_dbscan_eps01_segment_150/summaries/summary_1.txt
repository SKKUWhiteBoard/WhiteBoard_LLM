such that the limit as k goes to infinity of x sub n sub k equals liminf of xsub n. And again, this is a subsequence of a convergent sequence, so it's convergent and convergence of the same thing, L. So that implies that this thing is equal to L. And therefore, the limsup and the liminf equal each other, and they also equal the limit of the original sequence. That is the end of the proof of this theorem. CASEY RODRIGUEZ: We proved two theorems last time, and we used them for-- and we had a couple of applications of them. He says we can define a positive real number to a rational power using elementary facts about the real numbers. Roddiguez: You don't need the exponential and the logarithm to make sense of a real number of power. But we're just going to use the basic properties of exponents throughout all this so we don't use derivatives.
