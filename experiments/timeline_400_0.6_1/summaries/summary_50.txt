RAFAEL JARAMILLO: Let's talk about intermediate phases and line compounds. He recalls intermediate phase in a three-phase system. He draws a free-energy composition diagram in such a case. Jaramillo: All possible common tangents are going to converge at the same point. He says this type of structure is a Laves compound, which is also known as Laves Laves, or Laves' compound. It's a broad structure, he says, and it can be used to develop new materials. 1/7 of the Gibbs free energy of the IV-III phase. And these phase factions are determined by lever law. This is really the point. When you have line compounds in coexistence in equilibrium, there are no internal composition variables. And that's what's led to everything we've been enjoying over the last month and a half, is the fact that solution phases are variable. And now we have these cases where the compositions are not there [INAUDIBLE] anymore. OK. I want to leave you with one final thought, which is leading into Wednesday's lecture,. which is the case of metal oxides. z is an integer or a rational fraction, and it's fixed-- SiO2, magnesium oxide, Al2O3, so forth. So when we return on Wednesday, we're going to talk about the thermodynamics of this reaction. We'll use this property of being line compounds, and we're also going to use a bunch of other things as well. Back to the page you came from. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion and @cnnopin.
