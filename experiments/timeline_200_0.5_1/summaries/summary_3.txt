In today's video i'll show you the importance of de-gassing your bread dough as it's fermenting. No matter how gentle you try to handle your dough you will always de-gas it if only a little bit in today's comparison video we'll make 4 breads they will be made from the same dough but they will all be treated differently. The first one of the four breads will be left alone from the beginning of fermentation until it's baked. The final one will be folded shaped and degassed three times and we won't be fermenting them for the same amount of time. why are you punching it punching is actually quite aggressive and you should never punch your dough the best thing to do is deflate it by pressing it gently as the dough ferments the gas pockets inside the grow larger and larger and the membrane of dough between those pockets can tear and the pockets of gas can fuse into larger pockets. If this process keeps going undisturbed the crumb of the bread can end up with large bubbles surrounded by denser areas of dough this of course not always a bad thing some high hydration breads are specifically made to have that texture as we punch down or deflate the dough the Gas pockets break down and split up resulting in a more tightly packed and even chrome structure. proof i tried to shape them similarly as i could so that the main difference between these breads would be the steps that we took or skipped now degassing folding and shaping is not just about what the crumb will be like it's also a way of controlling fermentation the loft on the left is almost ready to be baked while the other three they still need about an hour until they go in the oven as we know fermentation builds flavor and it helps develop texture of the crumbs and the crust by degassing the dough we are forcing it to rise back up again it basically has to start over.
