In a perfectly competitive market, the firm is a price-taker. No matter how many units they produce, they're just going to be able to get that same market price. Their marginal revenue curve will essentially just be a horizontal line like this. But in an imperfectly competitive market. If they just produce a bunch of their product, the price that they get in the market is likely to go down. So they will have their own firm-specific demand curve. If the demand curve is downward-sloping like that, the marginal revenue. curve is also likely to be even more downward- sloping. be rational for the firm to do? Well, once again, it would want to produce the quantity where the marginal cost is equal to the marginal revenue. But you see something interesting here. If they produce at this quantity, notice the price that they can get in the market is much higher than that. And because we see a situation where price is greater than your marginal cost, versus in a perfectly competitive market where you see that price is equal, that that is the optimal quantity. But because you have this gap, that people are willing to pay more than that marginal cost. You still aren't going to be able to produce any more.
