USDA, FDA, EPA, and NMFS are involved in key program functions related to food safety. In fiscal year 2003, the four federal agencies spent nearly $1.7 billion on food safety-related activities. USDA and FDA are responsible for most federal food safety resources. The agencies’ expenditures vary by program function (as shown in fig. 3). For example, USDA’s inspection/enforcement expenditures made up almost three-quarters of the total spent by these agencies for that program function.
