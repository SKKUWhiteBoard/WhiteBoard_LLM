Aristotle was born 384,15 years after the trial of Socrates. He was sent by his father to go to college. Unlike most of you, Aristotle did not spend four years at the Platonic Academy. He remained attached to it for the next 20, until the death of Plato. Unlike his intellectual godfather, Socrates, who wrote nothing but conversed endlessly, Aristotle wrote disciplined and thematic treatises on virtually every topic. He collected constitutions, 158 of them in all, from throughout the ancient world.
