The Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act of 1990 requires colleges to publish an annual security report. The report includes statements about campus law enforcement policies, security education and crime prevention programs, alcohol and drug policies, sexual assault education and prevention programs. The Department of Education is responsible for issuing guidance to implement the law, monitoring collegesâ€™ compliance with its requirements, and issuing two reports: a compilation of exemplary campus security practices and a report to the Congress on campus crime statistics. Two bills introduced in the 104th Congress would have required more detailed and current campus security records to be made accessible to the public.
