Michael Short: How do you know what, let's say, your dose distance relationship is? And how do you calculate all this stuff? Short: I've actually laser-cut out a little Geiger counter jig from a previous class. The international design center has a laser cutter that you can sign up to use. And it's set to just take a Geigercounter and put your sources at some fixed distance away. It's a pretty good approximation to the solid angle of something for very long distances. The experiment is basically change reactor power by half a megawatt. We're currently at 500 kilowatts and we're going to bring the reactor up to 1 megawatts and then bring it back down. We have about nine different instruments that tell us what the reactor power is at all times. We'll show you the proper way to make the entries and then do the actual movement itself. And since it's linear, it'll be double that-- so 17.1 megawatts.
