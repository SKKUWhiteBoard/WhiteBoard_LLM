angular momentum is a set of operators that provide observables, things we can measure. We showed that any component of angular momentum, be it lx, ly, or lz, commutes with l squared. It's a general theorem that two operators that commute, you can find simultaneous eigenstates of those two operators. We found that they satisfy a series of commutators in which lx with ly gave ih bar lz. We figured out by looking at this differential equation that if we wanted single valued wave functions-- wave functions would be the same at phi. Professor: If you have a system you want to figure out what are the properties of the states. In general, you will be led in any physical problem to look for the maximal set of commuting operators. We'll work back to the Schrodinger equation to finally obtain the relevant differential equation we have to solve. Then we'll look at the hydrogen atom and this task why? Having a proton and an electron we can reduce this system to as if we had one particle in a central potential. definition solves the differential equation star. This takes a little work to check. I will not check it, nor the notes will check it. It's probably something you can find the calculation in some books. But it's not all that important. The important thing to note here is the following. That this provides solutions for absolute value of m less or equal to l. And therefore m in between l and minus l. There's no great honor in finding zero solution of this equation. These are no solutions. The spherical harmonicas are going to be those wave functions. And they have a normalization, n l m, an exponention, and all that. So let me write, just for the record, what a y l m looks like with all the constants. The only one I really remember is that y 0 0 is a constant. It's 1 over 4 pi. That's simple enough. No dependents. Here is another one. y1 plus minus 1 is minus plus square root of 3 over 8 pi e to the plus minus i phi sine theta.
