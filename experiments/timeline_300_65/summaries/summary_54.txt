In the colonial era, most American women of European descent lived lives much like those of their European counterparts: They were legally and socially subservient to men. Lower and working class women were actually more equal to men of their own classes, but only because they were, like, equally poor. In general, throughout world history, the higher the social class, the greater the restrictions on women. High class women have traditionally had the lowest mortality rates, which is one of the benefits of you know doors and extra lifeboats and whatnot. expected to marry and have kids rather than, like, pursue a career. Under the legal principle of “coverture” actually husbands held authority over the person, property and choices of their wives. Since women weren’t permitted to own property and property ownership was a precondition for voting, they were totally shut out of the political process. Citizens of the new Republic were therefore definitionally male, but women did still improve their status via the ideology of ‘Republican Motherhood’ domesticity decreed that a woman’s place was in the home, so rather than making stuff, the job of women was to enable their husbands to make stuff. “Woman is to win everything by peace and love; by making herself so much respected, esteemed and loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart.” “The moment woman begins to feel the promptings of ambition, or the thirst for power, her aegis of defense is gone. All the sacred protection of religion, all the generous promptings. of chivalry, all of the poetry of romantic gallantry, depend upon woman�'s retaining her place as dependent and defenseless, and making no claims, and maintaining no right” The idea of true equality between men and women was so radical that almost no one embraced it. The truth is, most American women had no chance to work for profit outside their houses, so many women found work outside traditional spheres in reform movements. Reform movements were open to women partly because if women were supposed to be the moral center of the home, they could also claim to be moral conscience of the nation. Many of the most famous advocates for legally prohibiting the sale of alcohol in the US were women, like Carry Nation. 19th century. Women gave many temperance lectures featuring horror stories of men who, rather than seeking refuge from the harsh competition of the market economy, found solace at the bottom of a glass or at the end of a beer hose. Now don't get me wrong: Prohibition was a disaster, because 1. Freedom, and 2. It’s the only time we had to amend the constitution to be like, “Just kidding about that other amendment,” but it’S worth remembering that back then people drank WAY more than we do now. Many women were also important contributors to the anti-slavery movement, although they tended to have more subordinate roles. The most visible manifestation of it was the issue of woman’s suffrage, raised most eloquently at the Seneca Falls Convention of 1848. The movement for women's rights was primarily a middle-class or even upper class effort. It was an international movement. Often American feminists travelled abroad to find allies, prefiguring the later transatlantic movement of other advocates for social justice like Florence Kelley and W.B DuBois. American women changed the world for better and for worse, just as great men do. And along the way, they made “the woman question’ part of the movement for social reform in the United States. In doing so, American women chipped away at the idea that a woman’s place must be in the home. That might not have been a presidential election or a war, but it is still bringing real change to our real lives on a daily basis. I’ll see you next week.
