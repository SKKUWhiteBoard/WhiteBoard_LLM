Of the nearly 11,000 amendments proposed in the centuries since, only 27 have succeeded as of 2016. The founders of the United States were trying to create a unified country from thirteen different colonies. For an amendment to even be proposed, it must receive a two-thirds vote of approval in both houses of Congress. To actually change the Constitution, the amendment must be ratified by three-quarters of all states. The result of such high thresholds is that, today, the American Constitution is quite static.
