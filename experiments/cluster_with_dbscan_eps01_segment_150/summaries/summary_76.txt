All the bundles here are preferred over the original two bundles, why because here at this point utility is increasing in this direction. So, it is convex. Convexity is satisfied, continuity is satisfied. rationality axioms are satisfied. What is not satisfied here is monotonicity or local non-satiation is satisfied everywhere except at this bliss point, is it clear? So, now, what we will do we will start talking about mathematical problems, optimization, and all. So, the first we learned rationality, rationality axioms - completeness, reflexivity and transitivity. And when our when someoneâ€™s preference exhibit these three properties, what does it mean that he is able to completely rank all his choices all his potential choices, with also possibility, with possibility that there are more than one bundle at some ranks this is a possibility. One thing also I should add that he will be able to rank only if he has finite consumption set and also what we have learned that this will translate into a utility function. So, from here we learned that indifference curve has to be downward sloping.
