David Kaiser: particle cosmology is a new subfield within physics. He says it studies the smallest units of matter, the fundamental forces and elementary constituents of matter. Kaiser: The field is doing pretty well these days by other measures. Its annual budget just within the U.S. is on the order of $1 billion a year, roughly, he says. It is really a booming, booming subject of study, Kaiser says. The field literally didn't even exist 45 years ago, he adds. In 1979, two separate theorists introduced a whole new model where they didn't only cite Brans-Dicke and Higgs, they literally united them. They proposed a new model in which these two fields were literally the same. Here they're coming along almost 20 years later to say, maybe there's actually the same field in space and time, with which other matter interacts. So there's a direct coupling between this new field and this hypothetical geometrical structure. And so you can think of it as like the balance of energy between the local curvature of space and so on. He wandered into this field really accidentally. He finished his PhD at Harvard in 1970. His work was squarely in particle physics, the fancy new symmetries and new nuclear forces. He then had a sabbatical early on in his faculty career, and he happened to go to Paris. He was basically in a stranger's apartment, reading the mail, just reading papers on the coffee table. And these looked really interesting. And in fact, they sparked. his interest in gravitation and cosmology. soon, everyone. Soon, everyone will be able to play together again. Soon. Everyone will be playing together.soon. Everyone.
