which we are to for next week and here and I'll talk about that actually week from today because it's callay on Monday so it will get behind but if we get any further behind I'll have to make it up sometime the but if you don't have that you be copies available upstairs is it c um come to my office okay to dany's office he doesn't have copies of it there that's six six upstairs in the first floor immediately after CL and then on the next Friday I will talk about the parts in the in the inquiry that were assigned and also a that essay of of the oral concept. The English Constitution was at that time widely regarded this a sort of accepted view on all sides it's a hex Constitution that this problem as I say arose during the exclusion crisis of 1679 and 81. In the English case of course it's the crown and Parliament so we're only actually dealing with two agents in this case and neither is supreme so we want to say that they are coordinate powers for example the legislation that cannot be enacted without the crowns of consent and the crown must consent to all directives or laws that Parliament enacts. L's view was that Charles II then had violated his trust and it altered the form of the Constitution and therefore the government was dissolved against to power of the Comm brought into play. Mark says nothing about the details of of this process that is how does he Enis that this constition power is actually to take place he doesn't give any institutional account of how he supposes actually might be done laon is also vague on this he says something has the idea that it would begin in the county courts and they organized there. view came out too late in 166 restoration what I did was to see the importance of this view formulate in a very brief and readable clear manner I think uh and it is I think reasonable account of the basis of sovereignty in a constitutional machine. I think that what happen since losty is that one has found ways to express what appear to be elements of or features of cons digent power EG by by having a procedure for Constitutional Amendments and and how they are done one then has an Institutional procedure where you might say exercising this constition power. and who does not have the right to vote and what the conditions on it are maybe we want to free it from that of course what I'm thinking of eventually um is that that that would be one motivation for introducing an idea like the origal position that say it's a way of conceiving how con power might be exercised. No point in criticizing someone for something they didn't intend to do okay well I think it's stop so remember there's no class here Monday so the next class here will be next Friday.
