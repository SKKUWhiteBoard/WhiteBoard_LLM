The famous example was posed by Comte de Buffon back in the 18th century. It marks the beginning of a subject that is known as the subject of geometric probability. The problem is pretty simple. We take a needle that has a certain length-- l-- and we throw it at random on the plane. The needle might fall this way, so that it doesn't cross any line, or it might fall that way, and it ends up crossing one of the lines. If the needle is long enough, it might actually end up crossing two of the Lines. much more streamlined. There's not going to be any choices. We just need to consider the event of interest, express it in terms of the random variables that we have in our hands, and then use the probability model to calculate the probability of this particular event. When will the needle intersect the nearest line? This will depend on the following. We have an intersection if and only if the vertical extent-- which is this vertical green segment-- is larger than the distance x. Or equivalently, if x is less than the vertical amount of the needle. our case is four over pi d-- and integrate it over the set of x's and theta's for which the PDF is non-zero. So what are these pairs? This event can occur with any choice of theta. So theta is free to vary from 0 up to pi over 2. How about x? For this event to occur, x can be anything that isNon-negative as long as it is less than or equal to this number. And all we need to do now is to evaluate this double integral. is this 4 with this 2 give us a 2. We have 2l over pi d. And then the integral from 0 to pi over 2 of sine theta. Now the integral of sines is minus cosine theTA. And we need to evaluate this at 0 andpi over 2. This turns out to be equal to 1. And this is the final answer to the problem that we have been considering. And now, a curious thought. How can you figure out the number pi? Take your needle, throw it at random a million times, and count the frequency with which the needle ends up crossing the line. And if you know the length of your needle and of the distance between the different lines, you can use the estimate of that number to determine the value of pi.
