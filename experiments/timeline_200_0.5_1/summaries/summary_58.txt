Half of the people they spoke to experienced negative impacts on their mental health due to the heat. People on Lower incomes and other disadvantaged groups groups were more likely to feel the negative effects of extreme heat because it was harder for them to keep their homes cool. You don't even need to be alive to experience some of these effects a study of expecting mothers who experienced Hurricane Sandy in 2012 the huge storm that hit New York showed that in unborn children who did experience that storm girls as early as preschool were 20 times as likely to experience anxiety. people in that storm showed that about half of these folks had some kind of post-traumatic stress and that's relative to 5% of the general population. Direct effects of climate change on people's mental health there's also knock on effects like loss of income and Rising prices which inevitably have implications for people's well-being.
