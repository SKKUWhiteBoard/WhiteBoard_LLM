AA and I are going to show you how to make vanilla extract so easy so yummy so good for all the things that you would use it for cakes whatever really really good isn't it so let's go [Music] simple now all you want for this is about 1 oz or roughly 30 G of vanilla beans so they'll be you know long Dobby whacker things and just cut them up into I don't know a couple of cenm you may maybe maybe qu an inch half an inch or so. cup of vodka that's it all you do is put on the lid and just give this a shake and you just have to shake this once a day for at least a month preferably 2 to 3 months cuz you'll get more flavor it will ferment and it'll be a nice strong flavor just store this in a dry cool place and just as I said just shake once aday as you can see it's nice and dark I've been shaking this every day for about 2 months now a month will be enough but the longer you leave it the more flavor you'll have. like this no no you don't want to try it oh it smells so good do I smell this no you sure no it's really good can I smell it no oh let's give this a little little taste hold on oh yummmy do you want totry no no I'll see you next time for my next [Music] meal.
