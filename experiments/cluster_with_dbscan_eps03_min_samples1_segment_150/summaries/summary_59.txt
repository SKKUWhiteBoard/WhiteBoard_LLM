The science of classical mechanics establishes an important principle of cause and effect. Newton's Laws of Motion established the scientific principle of analyzing observed phenomenon through the use of clearly articulated mathematical models. These concepts are so important to the modern branches of science and engineering that we require all of our undergraduates at MIT to take classical mechanics regardless of whatever course they intend to specialize in. In many high school level physics courses, mechanics is taught as a set of formulas to memorize for a series of standard situations. 8.01 assumes a strong background in high school level physics and mathematics. It is a rigorous and technically challenging course aimed at MIT undergraduates. The OpenCourseWare site contains a coherent set of lessons that will take you through all the basic concepts of classical mechanics. In each of these lessons, you will find a series of short lightboard videos that will help you understand concepts, mathematical derivations, and problems solving techniques. You will find many other useful resources including an online textbook, many worked example problems, and MIT. level problem sets. Developing a command of mechanics is a powerful tool for understanding the world around us. Welcome to 8.01, the latest version of the Java programming language. We hope to see you in the next edition of Java 8, which is scheduled to be released later this year.
