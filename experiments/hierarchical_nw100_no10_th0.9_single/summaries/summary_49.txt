The Refugee Protection Act of 2011 would make significant revisions to asylum policy. The bill would eliminate the time limits on seeking asylum in cases of changed circumstances. It would also proscribe conditions under which an asylum seeker who was a victim of terrorist coercion would not be excluded as a terrorist. The U.S. has long held to the principle that it will not return a foreign national to a country where his life or freedom would be threatened. The law states other conditions for mandatory denials of asylum claims, including when the alien has been convicted of a serious crime.
