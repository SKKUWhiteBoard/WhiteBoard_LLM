In this section, we're going to talk about the relativistic Doppler effect. And we make good use of our space-time diagrams, which we discussed earlier. So the question is not how this observed-- how this is seen by the source but how it is being seen by an observer. So we have to apply Lorentz transformation. So in the last section of Special Relativity, we'll look at the effect on the speed of light, and how it relates to space and time. We find delta t prime is equal to gamma delta t minus v over c squared delta x. Tau prime is then gamma times c tau over c minus v times 1 minus v square over c square. And we find then-- this is a little bit of an algebra exercise here-- that the period now is given by 1 plus beta over 1 minus beta square root of that times tau. And the frequency is the inverse. So we just calculated relativistically how the period and the frequency of a wave is Lorentz transformed.
