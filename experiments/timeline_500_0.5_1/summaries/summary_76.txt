Learn how the solar cell device converts sunlight, the input energy, to some usable output energy, which is in the form of electricity, typically, from a solar panel. Learn how to minimize the amount of light reflected or not absorbed into maximizing amount of life that's actually absorbed. Learn about the duality of light, or how to think about light as a particle, or alternatively, as a quantified particle. Use the weekly Newsquiz to test your knowledge of stories you saw on MIT OpenCourseWare. by some sort of scattering intensity within the medium-- and this sigma here can refer to a variety of processes. If we increase the total thickness, we're going to decrease the total amount of light coming through via that exponential function. The alpha, obviously, is going to be very different for our atmosphere than it was for these little polyethylene sheets. Because the nature of the scattering and absorption processes are very different. for the atmosphere than for here, the density of the material and so forth. We're going to look at two different materials, silicon and gallium arsenide. We'll calculate the thickness necessary to absorb 90% of the incoming light at 550 nanometers. Most of these solar cells that you see of crystalline silicon are on the order of 100 microns, a little thicker. But for technological reasons, which we'll get to, you need about that thickness to absorb a lot of light. And I'll pass around some of the materials right here so you can get a sense of how thick they are.
