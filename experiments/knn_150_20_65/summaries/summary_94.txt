SNLI is the Stanford Natural Language Inference Corpus-- MultiNLI, and Adversarial NLI. The premises are all image captions from the image Flickr30K data set. All the hypotheses were written by crowdworkers. The overall Fleiss kappa measured interannotator agreement was 0.7, which is a high rate of agreement. It's clear at this point, for example, that ensembles of deep learning methods are the best for this problem, says Christopher Potts. The train set is a mix of cases where the model's.pair is independently validated. So in this way, we're kind of guaranteed to get a lot of examples that are very hard for whatever model we have in the loop in this process. And so what we're hoping is that as we progress through these rounds, these examples are going to get harder and harder in virtue of the fact that the model is trained on more data and is getting better as a result of seeing all these adversarial examples.
