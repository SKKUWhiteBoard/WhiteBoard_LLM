the string, too, were massless. So we have simply mp plus mw a. And so we can now solve for the tension in the string, which is equal to mp plusmw times g plus a divided by 3. And recall that this tension, that the string is pulling, this is what we called the force that the person [? of ?] the string on the person. And by Newton's third law, that's also, on the washer, thatâ€™s also the force. So now that we've combined pulley A, string 2, platform, and washer as our system, we can now address our question. If we measure the acceleration of the person, what is the force that the person pulls the rope down with? Well, of course, that will just be the tension in the string. And with this simple system,we can now apply Newton's second law, F equals ma. And so by thinking about how to choose a system, what could be a very complicated problem, with lots of equations, is simply one equation.
