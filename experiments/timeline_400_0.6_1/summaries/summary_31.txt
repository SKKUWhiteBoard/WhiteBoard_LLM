Vital Signs are pain oxygen saturation temperature heart rate respirations and blood pressure. The six Vital Signs are rated on a scale of zero to 10 with zero being no pain at all and 10 being the worst pain they've ever had. Here in a second I'm going to show you how to actually count the heart rate using the radial artery. I'm also going to go over how to take a blood pressure reading. I'll be back in a few minutes with the next Vital Signs video.
