Ani was a real person, a scribe from the Egyptian city of Thebes who lived in the 13th century BCE. Ani's epic journey begins with his death. His body is mummified by a team of priests who remove every organ except the heart, the seat of emotion, memory, and intelligence. It's then stuffed with a salt called natron and wrapped in resin-soaked linen. The wrappings are woven with charms for protection and topped with a heart scarab amulet that will prove important later on. The Papyrus of Ani has been in the British Museum since 1888. Only Ani, if anyone, knows what really happened after his death. But thanks to his Book of the Dead, we can imagine him happily tending his crops for all eternity. In the endless and lush field of reeds, Ani meets his deceased parents. Here, there is no sadness, pain, or anger, but there is work to be done. Like everyone else, he must cultivate a plot of land, which he does with a Shabti doll.
