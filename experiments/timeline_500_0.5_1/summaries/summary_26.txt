GILBERT STRANG: Take a bar, a material bar. The ends of the bar are kept at temperature zero, they're frozen. Heat is flowing around in the bar, and where is it going? It's flowing out the ends. So I insulate the bar and I put it in the freezer. And I have an ordinary bar and an ordinary temperature. And the heat is escaping out the sides, so the end x equals 0 and the end f equals 1. And that's the solution.
