King Arthur was thrown a party at Camelot for Christmas. A towering knight riding an emerald steed burst into the room. He proposed a game. The bravest warrior present would attack him with his own axe. If they could strike him down, they would win his powerful weapon. However, the knight would be allowed to return that blow in one year and one day. No man could survive such a strike. Arthur’s nephew, Sir Gawain, took the weapon instead. And with one swift strike, he beheaded the grinning knight. The Green Chapel is said to be located at a shimmering castle on the horizon. The castle’s lord and lady were thrilled to help such an honorable guest, and informed him that the Green Chapel was only a short ride away. They implored Gawain to rest at their home until his meeting with the Green Knight. In exchange for their hospitality, the lord made a strange request. Over the next three days, he would go hunting and share his spoils every night. In return, Gawain must give him whatever he'd gained during his day at the castle. of Arthur’s knights. He’d planned to spare his neck entirely, until Gawain concealed the sash. Filled with shame, Gawain returned to Camelot. But to his surprise, his companions absolved him of blame and celebrated his valor. Struggling to understand this strange journey, it seemed to Gawain that perhaps the whole world was playing a game. With rules more wild and bewildering than any man could understand, he wondered if the world was a game, too.
