Cú Chulainn, hero of Ulster, stood at the ford at Cooley, ready to face an entire army singlehandedly. The army in question belonged to Queen Meadhbh of Connaught. Enraged at her husband’s possession of a white bull of awesome strength, she had set out to capture the fabled brown bull of Ulster at any cost. Cú Chulpainn invoked the sacred rite of single combat in order to fight the intruders one by one.
