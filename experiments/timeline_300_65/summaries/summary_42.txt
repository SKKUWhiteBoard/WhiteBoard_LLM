The unit came out of the Manhattan Project. The idea of the scientist was to confuse potential spies towards what cross-sections for nuclear processes are. One barn is a cross-section where it's really, really hard to miss. In this context, also, the shed was introduced. This is not very popular today anymore. It turns out that this idea of confusing the readers of papers or of discussions turned into a new standard. So we continue the discussion in 8.701 on units. In particle physics and in nuclear physics, use a system called natural units. This system is based on fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics and special relativity. The idea here is that we replace kilogram, meters, and seconds by h-bar, which is a unit of action in quantum mechanics, c, the speed of light, and GeV, where GeV is a typical approximate mass of a proton. When you talk about relativistic equations, E equals m c squared and all those things, m, E, and also the momentum have the same unit. equal to 0.197 GeV femtometers. On top of this, it's useful to use Heaviside-Lorentz units and combine them with some measurable units we discussed. So this is also very convenient, to have this kind of convention. So we'll use those natural units as we go through class. In some examples, we will use SI, in others, use natural units. This will always be clear from the problem we're looking at. So you should already know the answer from previous discussions in the lecture.
