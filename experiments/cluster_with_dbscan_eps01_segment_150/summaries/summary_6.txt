so these are some things that these models wanted to optimize over time accuracy performance and model size um model size is something that has a trade-off if you get too big you lose out on other metrics like accuracy. performance is something directly corresponds to depthwise convolutions and mobile nuts for Edge Computing and things like that. You want to drastically reduce the number of computations that you want to do yep that is basically everything for today thank you guys for coming oh and there will also be a quiz. I want to start by sort of recapping what we talked about last Tuesday um I apologize that was kind of a rough introduction that was uh that was me making a couple of last minute edits that probably hurt more than they helped so I want to just review um convolutions and and the architecture of a CNN to make this more clear and put it into perspective how it relates to um just standard um dense neural networks I think it's fine. When you have images and a CNN you can simply just do convolutions instead of your normal matrix multiplication um which is demonstrated up here.
