Grenade algorithm uses a minimal set of three-point correspondences to solve the camera pose estimation problem in the grenade formulation. The disadvantage of this particular formulation is that it ends up with a four degree polynomial which means that it could give up to a total of four possible solutions. The question becomes whether can we find the solution directly from any four point correspondences such that the solution is unique? The answer is yes and it was formulated by quan at all in a paper that was published in the 1990s. s1 we know that t5 here is actually a vector that is made up of the same entry but of different order so x4 x3 x2 x and 1 of different entry. We know that by observation any two elements the product of tij is going to be equal to tk and tl for this constraint to be valid where i plus j must equal to k plus l. We can substitute the respective components of t5 into this particular constraint to get this equation over here. where we can solve for since we know that x equals to s1 squared we can solved for the final depth by taking the square root of x. Once s1 is solved we can back substitute s1 into the polynomial equation of f i j s i and s j equals to zero. Once f sj is solved, we can then back substitute it into another equation with sj and solve for the other unknown depth. Finally we will get all the depth after we have gotten all the unknown depths we can do the same thing to to apply absolute orientation to recover the camera pose as in the grenade algorithm. equation we can stack them all up so one two all the way to six equations and we end up with a coefficient matrix with an a matrix of of dimension 6 by 5. in order for non-trivial solution to exist then this guy here better be of a maximum of rank four so what we can do here is that we can take the svd of a and this will give us u sigma v transpose where we simply the vector that corresponds to the least singular value in sigma.
