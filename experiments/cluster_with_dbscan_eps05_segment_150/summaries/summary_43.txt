Jeffrey Grossman: We're going to talk about energy storage. He says the planet is kind of a storage device for that thing over there. Most energy storage needs are going to be around a year or less, he says. Grossman says electricity is more and more important in our lives. We'll go into batteries and then talk about the chemistry of batteries and throw in a couple of, why this matters, he writes..com/jeffrey-grossman/energy-storage-technique. The growth in solar and wind has been incredible over the last 10, 20 years. The problem, as I think I've shown you, is the variability. There's no way to use renewables at large scales unless you store it. You can't solve renewables at the scale of the grid without storage. And no option exists today. It might be batteries, but there's nothing that actually does it today at the scales that we are at.go in everything now, all the way up to the grid. And that was my last Why This Matters in the last 2 and 1/2 minutes. need. So that's a real challenge for chemistry. I hope you guys have a great Thanksgiving and maybe hook up some different metals.

A messier room does not have higher entropy, and in this case, it's just simply the rules of the algorithm. I have rules here about need. So that's a real challenge for chemistry.
