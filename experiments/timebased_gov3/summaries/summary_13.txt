PPACA directed each state to establish and operate a state-based health insurance marketplace by January 1, 2014. Marketplaces were intended to provide a seamless, single point-of-access for individuals to enroll in private health plans, apply for income-based financial assistance, and obtain an eligibility determination for other health coverage programs. In states electing not to establish a marketplace, PPACA required the federal government to operate a marketplace in that state, referred to as a federally facilitated marketplace. For plan year 2016, 13 states had aState-based marketplace, 4 had a State- based marketplace using the federal marketplace platform, 27 had a federal facilitated marketplace, and 7 had a state partnership marketplace. designed to provide support to consumers in completing an application, obtaining eligibility determinations, comparing coverage options, and enrolling in health care coverage. The data hub is a CMS system that acts as a single portal for exchanging information between the federally facilitated marketplace and external partners. The hub was designed as a “private cloud” service supporting the following primary functions: Real-time eligibility queries. Transfer of application and taxpayer information. Exchange and monitoring of enrollment information with issuers of qualified health plans. The data hub is designed to not retain any of the data that it transmits in permanent storage devices, such as hard disks. According to CMS officials, data are stored only momentarily in the data hub’s active memory. The entities that transmit the data are responsible for maintaining copies of their transmissions in case the data need to be re- transmitted. As a result, there is no need for the data to be stored on a permanent hard disk. The data hub has an encrypted system-to- system web browser connection. CMS does not consider the data hub to be a repository of personally identifiable information. State-based marketplaces generally perform the same functions that the federally facilitated marketplace performs for states that do not maintain their own marketplace. In certain cases, states may elect to perform one or both of the plan management and consumer assistance functions while the federal marketplace performs the rest. The specific functions performed by each partner vary from state to state. Most states need to connect their state Medicaid and CHIP agencies to either their state-based marketplace or the federally facilitating marketplace to exchange data. with the IRS (also through the data hub) in order to verify an applicant’s income and family size for the purpose of determining eligibility. State-based marketplaces are to send enrollment confirmations to the federally facilitated marketplace so that CMS can administer advance payments of the premium tax credit and cost-sharing payments. Federal laws and guidance specify requirements for protecting federal systems and data. This includes systems used or operated by a contractor or other organization on behalf of a federal agency. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 requires each agency to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program. contractor, or another organization on behalf of an agency. NIST has developed a risk management framework of standards and guidelines for agencies to follow in developing information security programs. Relevant publications include: Federal Information Processing Standard 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems. Federal Information processing Standard 140-2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, requires agencies to encrypt agency data, where appropriate, using NIST-certified cryptographic modules. The guidance includes privacy controls to be used in conjunction with the specified security controls. Resilient Systems (draft), recommends steps to help develop a more defensible and survivable IT infrastructure. While agencies are not yet required to follow these draft guidelines, they establish a benchmark for effectively coordinating security efforts across complex interconnected systems. Agencies that collect or maintain health information also must comply with additional requirements. The Privacy Act of 1974 places limitations on information security and privacy in the federal government. In addition to FISMA, major laws and regulations establishing requirements for Information Security and Privacy include the following. The act defines a “record” as any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency. A “system of records” is a group of records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual. The Privacy Act requires that when agencies establish or make changes to a system of records, they must notify the public. The E-Government Act requires agencies to identify, among other things, the categories of data collected. of 2002 strives to enhance protection for personal information in government information systems. This assessment is an analysis of how personal information is collected, stored, shared, and managed in a federal system. Agencies must conduct a privacy impact assessment before developing or procuring IT that collects, maintains, or disseminates information that is in an identifiable form or before initiating any new data. More specifically, according to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, a Privacy Impact Assessment is anAnalysis of how information is handled to ensure handling conforms to applicable legal, regulatory, and policy requirements. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 establishes national standards for electronic health care transactions. The act calls for the Secretary of HHS to adopt standards for the electronic exchange, privacy, and security of health information. According to federal regulations, state-based marketplaces are responsible for protecting and ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of marketplace enrollment information. The Privacy Rule reflects basic privacy principles for ensuring the protection of personal health information, the authors say. They say weaknesses remained in both the processes used for managing information security and privacy and the technical implementation of IT security controls. GAO: CMS approved subsidized coverage for 11 of 12 fictitious GAO phone or online applicants for 2014. The applicants obtained a total of about $30,000 in annual advance premium tax credits, plus eligibility for lower costs at time of service. NIST defines an information security incident as a violation or imminent threat of violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices. A security incident can occur under many circumstances and for many reasons. It can be caused by a variety of factors. can be inadvertent, such as from the loss of an electronic device, or deliberate. FISMA requires the establishment of a federal information security incident center. The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) consults with agencies on cyber incidents. It provides technical information about threats and incidents, compiles the information, and publishes it on its website, https://www.us-cert.gov/. US-Cert, established in 2003, is the federal Information Security incident center that fulfills the FISma mandate. Between October 6, 2013, and March 8, 2015, CMS reported 316 incidents affecting Healthcare.gov or key supporting systems. None of the incidents described in the data included any evidence that an attacker had compromised sensitive data, including PII. Of the 316 incidents, 41 were reported to involve PII either not being secured properly or being exposed to an unauthorized individual. CMS also assessed incidents’ impact, categorizing incidents as having an impact of “Extensive/Widespread,’ “Significant/Large,” “Moderate/Limited,�” or “Minor/Localized” information and systems from unauthorized disclosure, modification, and loss. Specific controls include, among other things, those related to identification and authentication of users, authorization restrictions, and configuration management. CMS took steps to protect the security and privacy of data processed and maintained by the complex set of systems and interconnections that support Healthcare.gov, including the data hub. While CMS has taken steps to secure theData hub, we identified weaknesses in the technical controls protecting the data flowing through the system. For example, CMS did not appropriately restrict the use of administrative privileges for data hub systems. The State Based Marketplace Annual Reporting Tool (SMART) is intended to collect information to be used as the basis for evaluating a state-based marketplace’s compliance with regulations and CMS standards. CMS has not defined specific follow-up procedures or time frames, including identifying corrective actions to be performed if deficiencies are identified. Until CMS defines and documents its specific day-to-day procedures, the timing of when control activities are to occur, CMS does not have reasonable assurance that it is providing effective oversight of security and privacy. Although CMS has set requirements for periodic testing of the security controls at the state-based marketplaces, it requires neither continuous monitoring nor comprehensive annual testing. Any state seeking to gain an “authority to connect” to the data hub is required to submit documentation that it has properly secured its planned connection. The standard ‘authority’ to connect is issued for a 3-year period. Following the approval of the initial “ authority to connect,” every state is requiredto conduct reviews of the documentation on a yearly basis. According to the MARS-E, all security controls are required to be assessed over a 3-year period. The states were not required to submit evidence that they had tested subsets of controls each year. The need for better assurance that security and privacy controls are working properly was highlighted by the results of our reviews of technical controls at three state-based marketplaces, which identified significant weaknesses in those systems. For example: One state did not encrypt connections to the authentication servers supporting its system. One state reported 20 of the 27 high open findings during that time period. requires passwords to be encrypted when they are being transmitted across the network. One state did not filter uniform resource locator (URL) requests from the Internet through a web application firewall to prevent hostile requests from reaching the marketplace website. As a result, hostile URL requests could potentially scan and exploit vulnerabilities of the portal and potentially gain access to remaining systems and databases of the marketplace. NIST Special Publication 800-53 requires the enforcement of access controls through the use of firewalls. However, the state didn't fully configure its filtering to block hostile URL request. its Windows servers. NIST Special Publication 800-53 and MARS-E require that if an agency uses encryption, it must use, at a minimum, a Federal Information Processing Standards 140-2–compliant cryptographic module. However, the state did not configure its Windows Active Directory and Domain Name System servers to require the use of Federal Information processing Standards– compliant algorithms. As a result, the servers may employ weak encryption for protecting authentication and communication, increasing the risk that an attacker could compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the system. The results of our work were reported separately in “limited official use only” GAO: Healthcare.gov and its key supporting systems have experienced information security incidents. GAO: The information security weaknesses found in the data hub will likely continue to jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of healthcare.gov. HHS concurred with all of GAO’s recommendations, and provided information regarding specific actions the agency has taken or plans on taking to address these recommendations. The report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov/. as the incident reports and actions taken to mitigate the incidents. We also reviewed the reported impact of each incident. To address our second objective, we reviewed relevant information security laws and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards and guidance to identify federal security and privacy control requirements. Further, we analyzed the overall network control environment, identified interconnectivity and control points, and reviewed controls for the network and servers supporting the data hub. Lastly, we interviewed knowledgeable officials and reviewed CMS policies and procedures for incident handling. In order to evaluate CMS’s controls over its information systems supporting Healthcare.gov, we used our Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual. To assess the effectiveness of the three selected states’ key program elements and management controls, we compared their documented policies, procedures, and practices to the provisions and requirements contained in CMS security and privacy standards for state-based marketplaces. To evaluate the technical controls for the marketplaces, we analyzed the overall network control environment, identified control points, and reviewed controls. We conducted this performance audit from December 2014 to March 2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
