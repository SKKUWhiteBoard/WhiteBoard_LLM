U.S. economy and security are heavily dependent on oil, natural gas, and other energy commodities. Nearly half of the nationâ€™s oil is transported from overseas by tankers. Coast Guard seeks to mitigate many kinds of security challenges in the maritime environment. Terrorists have attempted and in some cases carried out attacks on energy tankers since September 11, 2001, authors say. The FBI shares responsibility with the Coast Guard for preventing and responding to terrorist incidents in U.S., they say.
