In the colonial era, most American women of European descent lived lives much like those of their European counterparts: They were legally and socially subservient to men. Lower and working class women were actually more equal to men of their own classes, but only because they were, like, equally poor. As production shifted from homes to factories, it shifted away from women doing the producing. This led to the so-called “cult of domesticity,” which like most cults, I am opposed to. Many of the most famous advocates for legally prohibiting the sale of alcohol in the US were women. Women gave many temperance lectures featuring horror stories of men who, rather than seeking refuge from the harsh competition of the market economy, found solace at the bottom of a glass or at the end of a beer hose. The temperance movement made a huge difference in American life because eventually, male and female supporters of temperance realized that women would be a more powerful ally against alcohol if they could vote. in comments where you can also ask questions about today’s video that will be answered by our team of historians.
