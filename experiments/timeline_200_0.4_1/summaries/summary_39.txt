This is part 2 of a guide to clinical reasoning or how to create an accurate differential diagnosis from a patient's presentation. In the first part I reviewed a practical five-step bedside approach to clinical Reasoning. In this part I will demonstrate how to use this approach with an actual patient case at the student level. I present this patient to you the same way in turn might present the patient to his or her attending on rounds or to their colleagues during a morning report or teaching conference as I present the case I'll keep a running list of the key features of the presentation. The patient is a 75 year old woman presenting with epigastric pain for four hours. The pain is constant does not radiate is not exacerbated by anything including nor alleviated by anything she had moderate nausea it has refused to attempt to eat or drink anything since the pains onset. She denies changes in her bowel habits shortness of breath chest pain changes her skin or eye color. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis has been ordered but not yet completed so let's review what I've identified as key features.
