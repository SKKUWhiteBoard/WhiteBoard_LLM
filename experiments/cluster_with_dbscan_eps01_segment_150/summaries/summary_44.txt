assume that the input are linearly separable, then there is a proof for this. And there are a bunch of other cases where you can have some partial results. Next week, in the next lecture, maybe the second half of next lecture,. I'm also going to give another result, which is somewhat more general. It applies to many different architectures, but it has other kind of constraints. First of all, it doesn't really show exactly these kind of landscape properties. It shows that these kinds of properties holds for a region, for a special region in the parameter space. Last time we talked about some of the kind of the bigger questions in deep learning theory. And today, we are going to start talking about the optimization perspective in deeplearning for two lectures. The main focus is to analyze what the functions you are optimizing look like so that you can use some trivial or some standard optimization algorithm for it. The bigger question we are trying to address here is that why many optimization algorithm are designed for convex functions. But why they can still work for nonconvex functions?
