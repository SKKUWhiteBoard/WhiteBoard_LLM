In this video, we're going to compute some useful quantities for the exponential random variable. The CDF of x is the probability that X is less than or equal to little x. We use the standard formula, which is minus infinity to infinity t times fx of t dt. For this, if you evaluate the balance, 0 makes this 0, and 0 to get 1 over. And so the expectation is 1 over lambda, and so the variance is part c, so OK, so far so good. The limit as x goes to infinity-- the exponential will beat x squared. We're asked for the PDF of z, which is the max of x1, x2, and x2. The probability of the max being less than or equal to z is actually also the probability of each of these random variables individually beingLess than orequal to z. The trick is to flip it and say we want to compute the min of x 1 x2 being greater than w. In that case, let's check if we can do this trick. If x1 and x 2 are individually bigger than w, then the min's also bigger. So it's going to be-- Notice the similarity between this and this. The only difference is this has a 2 lambda in there. That means that w is an exponential random variable with rate 2 Lambda. You can also take the derivative of this and find that you get this. OK, so we're done with the problems. We computed some interesting quantities for the exponentialRandom variable in this. So then the PDF isgoing to be an exponential, whatever it is for an exponential.
