Michael Short: How do you know what, let's say, your dose distance relationship is? And how do you calculate all this stuff? Short: I've actually laser-cut out a little Geiger counter jig from a previous class. The international design center has a laser cutter that you can sign up to use. And it's set to just take a Geigercounter and put your sources at some fixed distance away. It's a pretty good approximation to the solid angle of something for very long distances. Michael Short: I used to do environmental samples in this lab. He says the environmental side of this has quieted down a lot. But it's still useful for a bunch of things, he says. Short: The weirdest thing I've been asked to count? That's already activated, or? MICHAEL SHORT: At all. That was one of my samples. And the hair is a pain in the neck to work with. So I hope none of you give me hair samples. I won't run them. where it started, the 13.42 inches out of the bottom of the core. It might not make it all the way back up to [INAUDIBLE]. FRANK WARMSLEY: It'll be close. Compensate with the reg rod if you need to. 30.8. OK. And that's the end of the exercise. We'll be back in a few minutes with the results of the test. We hope to see you on "Larry King Live" next week. Most of the Boston area is 21, but once you leave Boston-- MICHAEL SHORT: It varies. If I've got something that's very radioactive, I'll just space it out away from the detector. If you've got things that's really hot, it just kind of swamps out the electronics. We did just go for a solid angle too, today. This is the spectrum I'm collecting on MIT 1. Right now, I don't know-- samples. But we'll figure out how many samples we'll run.
