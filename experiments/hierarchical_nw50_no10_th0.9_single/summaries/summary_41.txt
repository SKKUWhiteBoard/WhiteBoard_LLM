The existing federal-aid highway formula is the vehicle for distributing billions of dollars annually for highway construction and repair and related activities. Since the mid-1980s, a number of organizations (including GAO) have suggested fundamental changes in the formula for apportioning these federal- aid funds. Chapter 2 of this report evaluates the current apportionment formula. Chapter 3 discusses a process by which the Congress may reconsider the formula during the next reauthorization of the federal-Aid highway program.
