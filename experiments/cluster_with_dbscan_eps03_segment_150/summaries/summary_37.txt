Rousseau: Amour-propre only arises in society and is the true cause, he believes, for our discontents. He distinguishes it from another disposition that he calls amour de soi-meme, a sort of self-love. "Amour- Propre is merely a sentiment that is relative," he says, "artificial and born in society which moves each individual to value himself more than anyone else" The desire for recognition is at the root of our sense of justice, he says.

Borat: Inequality is for Rousseau far more what we might call "the moral and psychological injuries of inequality" than the material aspects of the phenomenon.

So meditate on that if you like for the next day. If you like, you can read the rest of the book tomorrow. It's a great read and a great way to start a new day. I hope you'll join me for a cup of tea and a glass of wine in the next few hours. I'm looking forward to seeing you in the morning. Rousseau's Second Discourse deals with the origins of inequality. He says amour-propre is the first and most durable cause of inequality for Rousseau. Rousseau speculates about how the passion of vanity was born. The passion to be seen is at the root of justice and virtue, he says, yet we know this passion is easily manipulable by those who wish to convince us of its value, he adds. The book is available in French, English, German and Spanish.
