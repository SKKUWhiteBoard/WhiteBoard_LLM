James W. Swan: I hope everybody saw the correction to a typo in homework 1 that was posted on Stellar last night and sent out to you. We don't want to give you a homework assignment that's punishing. We're still going to talk about transformations of matrices. We looked at one type of transformation we could utilize for solving systems of equations. Today, we'll look at another one, the eigenvalue decomposition, and on Monday, we will look at the singular value decomposition. We use a process called permutation. There's a certain class of matrix called a permutation matrix that can swap rows or columns. If I swap the rows and then I swap them back, I get back what I had before. There are lots of matrices that have this property that they're unitary. We'll see some today. We discussed how to solve systems of equations via Gaussian elimination if we want an exact solution. You're studying one of them in homework assignment now, where you know the matrix is banded. triangular form for this matrix. We'll talk next time about the singular value decomposition, which is another sort of transformation one can do when we don't have these complete sets of eigenvectors. You'll get a chance to practice these things on your next two homework assignments, actually. So it'll come up in a couple of different circumstances. I would really encourage you to try to solve some of these example problems that were in here. Solving by hand can be useful.
