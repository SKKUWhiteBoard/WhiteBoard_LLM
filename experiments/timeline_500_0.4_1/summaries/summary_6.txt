Chef Todd Moore shares with you the seven basic skills that I think everyone should have to cook food consistently in the kitchen and be proud of the results. The chef test highlights the skills that everyone should possess if they want to learn to cook anything at any time and be confident that it'll always come out great. If you already have all seven of these skills and cooking techniques great you can work for me on the other hand if you only have one or two ofthese skills that's still fantastic.
