Expectation is a basic question that will come up again and again when we look at random variables and probability theory. We're imagining n independent flips of a coin with bias p. The probability of heads is p. It would be biased in favor of heads if p is greater than 1/2. And we want to know how many heads are expected. So what's the expected number of heads? Well, we already know-- we've examined the binomial distribution B n,p.
