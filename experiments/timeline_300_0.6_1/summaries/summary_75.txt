Professor: The amygdala is closely connected to the basal forebrain. Professor: The abnormal brain connections that we know occur, at least many types of schizophrenia. He says the earlier the lesion, the greater the plasticity, the more chances of sprouting the connections that are the basis for this idea. In green, there are the very widespread catechol-oligosynaptic projections, which show the extent of the brain's plasticity. In blue, the acetylcholine containing neurons that you see in the medial septum, which we mentioned last time. Early in evolution, there was no dorsal striatum. It was a link between the olfactory, [INAUDIBLE],, and motor control. And we also know the outputs of that region go to hypothalamus and subthalamus. They influence the endocrine system and motivational states by these projections. They also have some connections in the midbrain, where they can influence the stacking patterns, especially locomotion. If the prefrontal cortex is functioning abnormally because of sprouting of these axons, then binding to the receptors will move it more towards the normal. unique in that way. And it's critical for the balance of this system. So anything that goes wrong with the subthalamic nucleus can cause major problems with movement. OK, so let's stop there today. We're going to take a break from talking about the human body. We'll be back next week with a look at some of the other animals in the animal kingdom.
