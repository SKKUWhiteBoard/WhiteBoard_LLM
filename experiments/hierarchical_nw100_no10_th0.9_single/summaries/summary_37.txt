The Army plans to purchase 85,488 FMTV trucks to replace its aging medium truck fleet. The FMTV acquisition strategy has two phasesâ€”prototype and production. The Army did not execute a low-risk acquisition strategy, the authors say. The authors recommend that the Army include safeguards in follow-on production contracts so that it does not repeat errors and does perform a cost and benefit analysis of its second source plans before continuing with them. They say the Army used a streamlined acquisition strategy to reduce the time required to develop and field FMTV vehicles.
