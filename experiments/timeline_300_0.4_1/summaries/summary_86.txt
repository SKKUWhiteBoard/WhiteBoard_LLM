In automotive design Dynamics plays a very important part because it's not rigid body Dynamics it's a bunch of rigid bodies with springs the Springs are called starts with an S suspens suspensions right and there's a trade-off between how comfortable the ride is and how tightly the car handles. In Dynamics there two sides to it one is how will its various degrees of freedom behave over time if you you know stretch it and let it go and it goes twang you know boing right and you want to figure out how it goes in time that that's analysis. I'm referring to something with no Dimensions but with a finite Mass you know that someone asked me the other day and I just want to be sure to say this. Let's say that you have a particle Point Mass heading that way some direction and let's define its velocity we'll call it a v p okay so I have um two questions both of which you probably know the answers to the first is what is the angular momentum of that particle just from your memory go ahead say it aha. This is a really badly designed classroom in the sense that there's not enough room but it's a huge classroom so I'm going to write it big right and I'm not that neat so you're going to have to bear with me. 99% 99% of all engineering graduates who take a car class in Dynamics Berkeley Stanford Princeton might not even see this there is this term and you need to know about it okay it just so happens the term vanishes in many situations. I'm just rearranging terms get this guys plus a pesky term so tell me is a to work equal to rate of change of angular momentum nor in general. call this Theta the initial length is L one and the initial velocity is we'll call it a scalar because this is how I'm defining the problem of V1 when we actually solve it we might have to define a vector okay. As the thing's going around this person is going to pull the string down and as it kind of goes around it's going to spiral in and end up it's a new length L2 and the question is what is V2 going to be okay.
