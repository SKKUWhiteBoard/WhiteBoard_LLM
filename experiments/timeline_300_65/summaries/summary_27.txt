GILBERT STRANG: Differential equations is the big application of calculus. He says it's interesting to see what information and ideas from calculus actually get used in differential equations. Strang: You really do need to know basic derivatives, the derivative of x to the n, the derivatives of sine and cosine. And above all, the chain rule, he says, that's really-- that it's chains, not just derivative of f plus g, but derivative of g plus f. of functions that really blow open the functions or we can deal with. The derivative of the integral of a function is this. Here is y and the integral goes from 0 to x. The x is the limit of integration. I won't discuss that fundamental theorem, but it certainly is fundamental and I'll use it. I just like that the use of the fundamental theorem. OK one more topic of calculus we need. This is the tangent to the graph. And what we need is y of t plus delta t. function because that's a nice function, e to the t. We can recreate that function from knowing its height, its slope, its bending and all the rest of the terms. That's called the Taylor series named after Taylor. Kind of frightening at first. It's frightening because it's got infinitely many terms. And the terms are getting a little more comp-- for most functions, you really don't want to compute the nth derivative. But the formula is beautiful because you see the pattern, that's really what mathematics is about.
