GILBERT STRANG: Differential equations is the big application of calculus. He says you really do need to know basic derivatives. Strang: The derivative of e to the x, which is e tothe x, is the solution to a basic differential equation. He shows how to use the fundamental theorem of calculus to check the formula. "It's kind of interesting to see what part of calculus, what information and what ideas from calculus, actually get used in differential equations," Strang says. Derivative is a linear operation. The product rule fg prime plus gf prime. The quotient rule. And above all, the chain rule. The derivative of this-- of that chain of functions, that composite function is the derivative of f with respect to g times the derivative. of g. That's really-- that it's chains of functions that really blow open the functions or we can deal with. OK. So I have a function t times another function of t. I'm going to use the product rule and show that the derivative is one term will be y and the otherterm will be q.
