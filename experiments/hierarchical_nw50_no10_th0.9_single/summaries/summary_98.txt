In September 2008, ongoing financial turmoil escalated into a financial panic. Large financial institutions, such as Lehman Brothers and AIG, were failing, the stock market was falling, and credit markets seized up. The federal government responded with a series of lending and guarantee programs to mitigate the economic damage. The FDIC established the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) on October 14, 2008, to strengthen confidence and to encourage liquidity in the banking system. The TAG program provides unlimited deposit insurance for $1.4 trillion in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts (NIBTAs)
