Summary:
epsilon positive there, we should be able to find a capital number M, such that if n is bigger than or equal to capital M, 1 over n to the p is less than epsilon. So that proves number one. So number two we'll do-- we really only need to do two cases. One is p. So p equals 1 is fine, because then I just get 1 for the whole sequence. Now let me do p bigger than 1. And if p is bigger. than 1, the absolute value of p to the 1. over n minus 1-- this is just p to. the 1 this thing times n plus 1. Convergent sequences are bounded, so-- and they have convergent subsequences. Limsup and liminf are also two important objects that arise in analysis. If they exist, there are going to be certain limits, so it's not clear that they exist at all to begin with. But we'll show that they always do exist. We define limsup x sub n, and sometimes I'll write n goes to infinity underneath. And the liminf is similar, except it's now with infs. such that the limit as k goes to infinity of x sub n sub k equals liminf of xsub n. And again, this is a subsequence of a convergent sequence, so it's convergent and convergence of the same thing, L. So that implies that this thing is equal to L. And therefore, the limsup and the liminf equal each other, and they also equal the limit of the original sequence. That is the end of the proof of this theorem. CASEY RODRIGUEZ: We proved two theorems last time, and we used them for-- and we had a couple of applications of them. The first was that a sequence converges to x if and only if the limit as n goes to infinity of the absolute value of xn minus x goes to 0. And then we also had the squeeze theorem, that if you have three sequences-- a sub n, b subn, and x sub n.

Summary:
The average value of a squared is equal to the sum over all possible ages of a times the ratio of Na to N. The average of the square of ages is the same thing. The expected value of some function of a is equal-- and this is something you don't usually do-- to the value of f of a, times the probability that you measure that value in the first place. It's a very useful relation. And so, again, does the average have to be measurable? No, it certainly doesn't. average value of a squared is not equal to 0. And that's because the squared has everything positive. So how do we characterize-- this gives us a useful tool for characterizing the width of a distribution? So here we have a distribution where its average value is 0, but its width is non-zero. And then the expectation value of the squared, the expected value of an a squared, isNon-Zero. This is going to be like our uncertainty. Well, I'm not sure. How unsure are you? Well, that should give us a precise measure. In quantum mechanics, the uncertainty is the square root of the standard deviations squared. Different probability distributions are going to give me different delta a's. When you write delta a, there's nothing in the notation that says which distribution you were talking about. In a physical system, the expected value of x depends on what the state of the system is, what the wave function is. So there are a quantum mechanics. And this has a different flavor. It carries different implications, and we'll see what that is later. The probability of having that momentum times momentum, right? Everyone cool with that? This is what you mean by probability. But we need to know if we have a quantum mechanical system described by state psi of x, how do we get the probability that you measure p? Do I want to do this now? Yeah, OK I do. And we need a guess. We made a guess at the end of last lecture that, in quantum mechanics, this should be dp minus infinity to infinity of the Fourier transform. This is what we're after. We want some good definition of p given that we're working with a wave function which is a function of x. If I take a state, psi of x, which is equal to e to the ikx, this is a state that has definite momentum h bar k. A state with a definite momentum has the property that, when you hit it with the operation associated with momentum, you get back the same function times a constant, and that constant is exactly the momentum we ascribe to that plane wave. your memory. Gainst death and all oblivious enmity shall you pace forth. Your praise shall still find room, even in the eyes of all posterity. So no judgment arise till you yourself judgment arise. You live in this and dwell in lover's eyes. May your day be filled with love and poetry. Whatever state you're in, we will always love you. Signed, Jack Florian, James [INAUDIBLE]. [LAUGHTER] PROFESSOR: Thank you, sir. The configuration of a particle is given by, or described by, a wave function psi of x. In 3D, the wave function would be a function of all three positions x, y and z. If there are two possible configurations the system can be in, it's possible to find the system in a superposition of those two psi is equal to some arbitrary linear combination alpha psi 1 plus beta psi 2 of X. The superposition principle is an important challenge for us in the next couple of lectures.

The government. is not a government, it is a body that has the power to decide what happens to people's lives. The. government is not the government. It is a group of people who have the power. to make decisions about people’s lives. It has the ability to make changes to the law. When you do not have unlimited amount of everything, you will have to make a choice, what to produce? In what quantity you should produce a particular good. Allocation is nothing but assignment, allotment, share, but in economics we are more technical about this particular term allocation. So, allocation here means solving these three fundamental or basic questions of economics, and the first question is what to produced? The second is how to produce and the third is for whom to produce. And depending on who makes these decisions we have different form of economy, who make these decisions.

CNN is where you have like an image like a person in it and you need to Output another image except each pixel has basically been like labeled with a person. In that case your output is the same size as your input which gets a little bit weird and we'll talk about that more later how you because at face value that would be like super inefficient all of your convolutions are on these just huge inputs. If you want to decrease the size of this volume because it can get quite unwieldy you can do pooling simply just looking at each. a little timeline here starting from uh alexnet and moving forward. laneet is something that was created quite a while ago. Alexnet in 2012 was a a big groundbreaking feat in that it proposed stacking layers of convolutions Max poolings following it up by fully connected layers and coming up with not a very deep network. This kind of uh turned a lot of heads when it achieved a around 17 error rate on imagenet. Inception Nets were proposed in 1990 by Yen lacun and he he kind of pioneered that pattern for today. The next slide should have an updated drawing that's hopefully a lot easier to understand than the previous one. This has a convolutional layer followed by a Max pooling layer. Three dense layers are following this last stack of convolutions and Max pooled. The motivation behind this is you want a deeper neural network. It computes a little bit better because computers evolve CPU power is able to handle these high order Matrix computations. The next slide is a visualization of how you have multiple layers that are stacked they're pulled together. so these are some things that these models wanted to optimize over time accuracy performance and model size um model size is something that has a trade-off if you get too big you lose out on other metrics like accuracy. performance is something directly corresponds to depthwise convolutions and mobile nuts for Edge Computing and things like that. You want to drastically reduce the number of computations that you want to do yep that is basically everything for today thank you guys for coming oh and there will also be a quiz. foreign and I should turn off the zoom background blur Ry options like this oh it does show up uh yeah there's like speaker notes on your screen but there's be careful because I accidentally just put something else in the first longer okay I don't need this man that eraser is disgusting this one yeah oh wow you're really going at it well I just think I was just too ready to go I usually uh yeah as our slides were they and put which is the product describing to replace the names of it oh no it's fine well it started as their Slide the best facts TZ so yeah it goes.

The principles of baking show us how to test the theory of cold fermenting. We'll make three breads one with the brief mint and two without one of the breads without the bereavement will be bulk fermented in the fridge for 24 hours. The third one will be made with a brief mint which will be left for 12 hours to ferment then it'll be mixed into the main dough. The main comparison I want to do today is between the two breads which will take the same amount of time to make. comparison for yourself then tell us of your results you might be surprised. What do you think of my test and my results have you ever tried something like this before do you use preference when cold fermenting let me know down in comments. If you want to see more videos like this one click over here subscribe to the channel click right here that's all I have for you today thank you so much for watching I'll see in the next one and I'll be back in a few days. Callback fermentation beats bereavement in every way it develops far more flavor it makes the crust crispier and the crumb most substantial and it simplifies the process because we don't have to make a separate thing. When it comes to cold fermentation versus brief mint there is no better method what is better is up to the use slightly less yeast in the dough that was made with the bravement and that was to compensate for the amount of yeast coming from the bereavement itself as it rises it multiplies.

Bayard Rustin was the chief organizer of the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Rustin grew up in a Quaker household, and began peacefully protesting racial segregation in high school. He remained committed to pacifism throughout his life, and was jailed in 1944 as a conscientious objector to World War II. In 1948, he traveled to India to learn the peaceful resistance strategies of the recently assassinated Mahatma Gandhi. He began to work with Martin Luther King Jr in 1955, and shared these ideas with him. As King’s prominence increased, Rustin became his main advisor. are or who we love.” “I’m so proud of you,” she says. “You’re so beautiful.’ ““I love you, too,’ I say.

Rustin was passed over for several influential roles in the 1960s and 70s, but he never stopped his activism. In the 1980s, he publicly came out as gay, and was instrumental in drawing attention to the AIDS crisis until his death in 1987. In 2013, fifty years after the March On Washington, President Barack Obama posthumously awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, praising Rustin’s “march towards true equality, no matter who we are or who we love”

Summary:
Deuteronomy contains northern traditions from before the fall of Israel, which was in 722. There are many passages that make it clear that it's written from an exilic perspective. The most salient feature of the Deuteronomistic School is the conviction that Israel's residence in the land is a function of its means for us today that it did happen. Another theme that we see in these books is the emphasis on what we call the Yahwist prophets -- prophets like Elijah and Elisha. They are held up as heroes and champions of religious purity. According to the Book of Joshua, Israel's tribal structure assumed its classical form at this time. The formation of the nation state, Israel, was much more complicated than the picture that's presented in Joshua 2 through 12. Scholars have proposed three possible models to explain the formation of Israel. The Yahweh cult may have been introduced by people escaping slavery from Egypt. Some elements within this group may have brought with them the story of a miraculous escape from Egypt to become the group that accepted the national god. The Hebrews at this stage were probably not a united people. in exile in Babylon. They are trying to make sense of the tragedy that has befallen them, the loss of their land. Consider how a text like Joshua 23 and Joshua 24 would go a long way towards explaining their fate while retaining faith in Yahweh. We're going to return to this when we reach the conclusion of the Deuteronomistic history in 2 Kings. It would be interesting to see how they would have reacted to the events of the time in which they were living. Christine Hayes: God's choice of Israel as the chosen one occurs for the first time in the Book of Deuteronomy. She says it is by no special virtue or merit that Israel was the one chosen. Hayes: The privilege of having been chosen or singled out entails obligations and responsibility. Deuteronomistic historian in general will get to the idea of God's providential concern for Israel, she says. in a moment we will see how important that is, or in a few lectures,how important that idea is for the Deuteronomic historian ingeneral.

The study of the effects of drugs on the human body was conducted in the 1970s and 1980s. The results of the study were published in a book called "The Effects of Drugs on the Human Body" The book was published by Oxford University Press in 1989. It was the first of its kind to be published in the U.S. and is published by Simon & Schuster, a division of Simon and Schuster Inc. in New York. The book is available in hardback and paperback. Bogdan Fedeles: Today we're going to be discussing the mechanism of HMG-CoA synthase. He says it's a key enzyme in central metabolism responsible for making the five carbon building blocks from which all sterols, such as cholesterol and steroid hormones, are made. Bogdan: We need to figure out which are the key hydrogen bonds and interactions that stabilize the tetrahedral intermediates. The three general mechanisms by which enzymes accelerate reactions are binding energy, general acid/general base catalysis and covalent catalysis.

Summary:
LocusLink is a repository of information about genes, and it collects everything that is known about the genes. No LocusLink assigns a name to each gene, and if you stick to that name, then you're sure that everybody knows what you're talking about. Other resources that we'll mention later use a different way of naming genes. This makes things very difficult when you're trying to build programs to integrate information from different places. It's very, very hard to know exactly how to reconcile different ways of naming gene. We need to be able to reliably identify which transcription factors bind to a given gene, and where, exactly, in the promoter region of the gene they bind. The ways that people have been using to do this are usually based on pattern matching. The binding site, as I said, is a small stretch of DNA, usually goes from five to about 20 or 25 base pairs. So they're really short. And they're characterized by [? concentric ?] sequences-- in general, they are not very precise. is a challenging task, because as we saw, biomedical data covers the whole spectrum of knowledge representation and management techniques that we know about. We are trying to make the most of the data we have, and we hope that it will help us understand more about the human condition. We hope that this article will be of interest to people around the world who are interested in biomedical data and data management techniques.

What are the different ways that we can store and describe this information? Where does it come from, where is it stored, how do we find retrieve and use it? He says there are some very deep differences between the kind of information you find when you're talking about the genotype, and when we'retalking about phenotypes. He says each one has its own specific nature and function, and needs to be treated with different tools.

Parsing the sentence "I ate fish" involves three actions. The first is to shift things onto the stack or to do the equivalent of a Reduce where I build dependencies. The second is to treat the second from top thing on the stack as a dependent of the thing that's on top of the stack. The third is to leave the head on the Stack ate, but I sort of add this dependencies as other dependencies I've built. The finished condition of successfully parsing the sentence is my buffer is empty and I just have root left on my stack. neural transition based dependency parsers. We sort of have gone down that we've halve that error-error rate. And we're now down to sort of about a five percent error rate. Yeah. I'm basically out of time now but there is further work including, you know, at Stanford. It's more accurate than 95 percent, right? So we- we're still going on but I think I'd better stop here today, um, and that's neural dependency parsing. [NOISE]. This week in week three, we're actually going to have some human language, and so this lecture has no partial derivative signs in it.

Summary:
Ti-silicide has a tendency to agglomerate when it's very thin at higher annealing temperature. Cobalt bisilicide does not have that narrow line effect, but it gives you a slightly higher resistivity. The modern silicide that I mentioned here is this nickel silicide, NiSi. It's formed at very low temperatures, 450 or 500. And it's a little bit less than the case of titanium. It consumes 2.2 or 2.3 or so nanometers of silicon per every nanometer of metal. silicide sheet resistance in ohms per square, it needs to be in this range of 6 to 10 ohmsper square. That's not a problem. None of that-- that's all in white, which means people know how to do that. The real problem is making these really good low resistivity contacts to the silicon. I just want to show an example of how-- so you get a feel for how the numbers work of how one does a contact resistance calculation. This is for a MOSFET. depletion of the polysilicon at very high gate biases. So people are concerned. They want to get rid of poly as the gate material. But poly is an extremely easy material to integrate. People know how to etch it. It's not reactive with SiO2. That's not the case for metals. So it here, what they had to do is put a metal and maybe some other harder material-- no, sorry, sorry. They had to put, yeah, contact material, and then maybe a dielectric. Slide 26 shows you some of the different uses of silicide in silicon technology. Silicide are used, as you can see, to strap the poly. It also forms a barrier layer, as we mentioned. And finally, it can be used as a gate material. And here's an example of nickel silicide, fully silicided gate that was published about six months ago by annealing at 450 degrees and using a thick enough layer of nickel. And you get a silicide all the way down to the gate interface. about your oral report or whatever, please get back to me. OK, thanks. About your oralReport.com. About. Your oral report.

We'd like to hear from you. The dagger algorithm aims to provide a more principled solution to the imitational and distributional Shi problem. The idea in dagger is to actually run the policy in the real world see which states it visits and ask humans to label those States. The goal is to collect data in such a way that P Pi Theta can actually learn from the data it's trained on. The basic version of dagger works like this and that's the version that you will all be implementing in your homework. It's a very simple algorithm to implement if you can get those labels. It can actually get up to fly pretty reliably through a forest dodging trees.

How good it is to be alive is a matter of adding up all of the--call it the contents of life.

What we want is the life of a human. We want a life in which we're accomplishing things, there's agency. The life of somebody who can have an emotional side. different aspect of death worth thinking about. What about the variability of death? After all, it's not just the case that we all die. Some of us make it to the ripe old age of 80,90 a 100 or more. Others of us die at 20, or 15, or 10, or younger. We could imagine a world in which everybody dies--everybody dies at the age of a hundred. Does it make things worse or better that there's this kind of variability? ask--so I'll throw the question out and we'll call it a day, start with this next time--then we have to ask, would it really be better to know? would you want the birthmark?

Summary:
here-- in other words, at a certain distance r away, how much does the area of this sphere-- does this detector take up? And a simple formula for the solid angle is just the surface area of whatever you've got over r squared. This approximate formula-- the blue curve-- is a pretty good approximation of the red curve until you get really, really close to 5 centimeters away, or about this distance right here. But this is actually not that good of an approximation when you put a source very, very up close to a detector. If you were to take this detector and bring the radius down to 0, if that solid angle went to, well, infinity , then the count the sphere or how much tin foil you had to use. Michael Shorter: Counting for longer can decrease your standard deviation. He asks, how long do you have to count in the smoke shop to be 95% percent sure? Shorter says the more error you allow, the shorter time you've got to count for. He says sometimes, do you necessarily have to be95% confident of your result? Depends on what you're doing, he says. But if you can't get within 5% error, there's always some trade-offs you can make. using a regular rod to move the reactor power up. You want to be careful when you raise reactor power. When you get to about 80% of the power level you're going to-- since we're going up to 1 megawatt, that's about 800 kilowatts. You'll drive the regulating rod inwards. It'll slow until it actually starts to go down again. Once it reaches that value and you see it going down, you now know that you could control the reactor and keep it from going away. where it started, the 13.42 inches out of the bottom of the core. It might not make it all the way back up to [INAUDIBLE]. FRANK WARMSLEY: It'll be close. Compensate with the reg rod if you need to. 30.8. OK. And that's the end of the exercise. We'll be back in a few minutes with the results of the test. We hope to see you on "Larry King Live" next week. Michael Short: How do you know what, let's say, your dose distance relationship is? And how do you calculate all this stuff? Short: So I've actually laser-cut out a little Geiger counter jig from a previous class. And you guys can all do this too. And we'll take a look at the solid angle subtended by this detector right here. And what we notice is that except for extremely short distances, this approximate formula for theSolid angle does not compute.

Professor: If we start out with all 0, 0, and then one mutation [INAUDIBLE]? And if that mutation-- are we assuming that that mutation is 0, 1 and then figuring out how to fix it? Professor: You have to keep track of lots of different things, and which regime we're in and so forth. If you had one copy of each of these two mutant individuals in the population, that's the answer to what is the probability that this0, 1 mutant would fix in thePopulation. syllabus that I mentioned. I think the most important thing to stress when thinking about evolutionary game theory is just that this point that we don't need to assume anything about rationality. Instead, you simply have mutations that sample different strategies. And then you have differences in fitness that just lead to evolution towards the same solutions of the game. So it's evolution to the game solutions, so the Nash equilibrium, for example. And the more fit individuals spread in the population. And somehow, you evolve to the same or similar solutions. is indeed the Nash equilibrium. It's to do this strategy D that we're saying here. All right, now the question is why? And part of the challenge here is just understanding how to read these charts. Now, if you look at this chart, you say, well, gee, that is a shame. Because 1 is just not the biggest number you see here. And indeed, the important point to note here is that if both players had followed this strategy C for cooperate, D for defect, then both individuals would be getting fitness 3. So the problem here is, it's always better to play D. are lines. But you can imagine that the only thing that's important are how these lines cross each other. So for example, there are only a few different things that can happen. You can have one strategy that dominates, which is what occurred here. And surprisingly, that does not mean that that strategy is higher fitness, in the sense that you may evolve to a state of low fitness. That's what's weird. YouCan have coexistence, or you can have bi-stability. not the definition of that. But this thing is true, which means that it's a Nash equilibrium. And if you have questions about this, I'm happy to answer it. It's explained in the book as well. We are out of time, so I should let you go. But good luck on the exam next Thursday.

With sinus hack the atrial rate is going to be greater than 100 beats per minute and then whenever you're looking at the p wave take your calipers and go from p wave to p wave and make make sure there's the same distance between those because that means it's occurring at a regular interval. Sustained sinus tachycardia can actually decrease cardiac output in your patient. As a nurse we want to assess for any potential causes for why our patient is running this rhythm. The patient can wear a halter monitor if they're at home having this and this will monitor their rhythm and then it'll go back to the cardiologist who will read can be ordered to bring down the fever and then the nurse's role is to report the rhythm change to the physician and let them know about it. cool extremities and then you want to teach the patient if you're able to avoid any activities that could further increase their sinus tag like if they're smoking or drinking caffeine or using any other stimulants because we don't want their heart rate to get up any higher okay so that wraps up this review over sonos tachycardia.

The sa node is located in the upper part of the right atrium. It is the starting point of the electrical conduction system. The sa node acts as the pacemaker of the heart. If it's working like it should it should cause your heart to beat at about 60 to 100 beats per minute. The reason this rhythm is occurring is because our sa node was firing rapidly and it's causing this heart to beating rapidly. The heart will start beating fast because it knows that the body is in dire need of oxygen.

Summary:
In this problem, we're given a collection of 10 variables, x1 through x10, where each i, xi, is a uniform random variable between 0 and 1. And we'd like to develop a bound on the probability that some of the 10 variables being greater than 7 using different methods. In part A, we'll be using the Markov's inequality, which says the probability x is greater than a is bounded above by the expected value of x divided by a. For part B, let's see if we can improve the bound we got in part A using the Chebyshev inequality. that even with 10 variables, the truth is more like this, which says that the distribution of x concentrates very heavily around 5, and hence, the probability of x being greater or equal to 7 could be much smaller than one might expect. That is, x is more likely to be greater than 7 than it is to be less than 7, and so the probability is much lower than one would expect. It is also more likely that x is greater than or less than 5, rather than equal to 6 or 7. a better bound. To remind you what a central limit theorem is, let's say we have a summation of i equal to 1 to some number n of independent and identically distributed random variables xi. We take the sum right here, and subtract out its means, which is E of the same summation, and further, we'll divide out, what we call normalize, by the standard deviation of the summation. So as the number of terms in the sums going to infinity, we will actually see that this random variable will converge in distribution.

the string, too, were massless. So we have simply mp plus mw a. And so we can now solve for the tension in the string, which is equal to mp plusmw times g plus a divided by 3. And recall that this tension, that the string is pulling, this is what we called the force that the person [? of ?] the string on the person. And by Newton's third law, that's also, on the washer, that’s also the force. So now that we've combined pulley A, string 2, platform, and washer as our system, we can now address our question. If we measure the acceleration of the person, what is the force that the person pulls the rope down with? Well, of course, that will just be the tension in the string. And with this simple system,we can now apply Newton's second law, F equals ma. And so by thinking about how to choose a system, what could be a very complicated problem, with lots of equations, is simply one equation.

Psychologist David Frum: What matters most for the moral blame that we assign is not what happened, but what Grace thought she was doing. He says that in scenarios like the one he gave you, what matters most is not how bad the outcome was, but how much blame Grace deserves. Frum says the scenario isolates one important feature of our moral judgment and also an important feature. of a lot of the rest of our social cognition. He asks: How much blame does Grace deserve for putting the powder in the coffee? And how much do you think she deserves? How do we think about other people as containing internal mental lives, mental representations? I'm going to talk about just fMRI, although I do use other methods to study this problem. I think fMRI has been both an incredible gift to our ability to understand the human mind and also imposes a huge number of limitations on what we can discover. And so what I want to tell you about is just a tiny bit of my phase one investigations using the early strategies that fMRI allowed us. And then a more in-depth look at how I'm using more modern techniques in fMRI to try to get further. mind is that, with respect to the representation of other people's thoughts, that doesn't tell us anything about how our brain does it. So the things that would make something a theory of mind-- a representation of who thinks what, why, and with what consequences-- we can't see in the univariate signal. What I think we're starting to make progress on using MVPA, is getting beyond that this brain region is involved in theory ofMind and trying to ask something about what is represented in this brain area. more general way of thinking about fMRI data. This particular method, using spatial correlations, is very stable and robust. But it's a special case of a much more general set. It's a very stable, robust method, but it's not a very general way to look at fMRI. It doesn't work for all fMRI patients, but for some, it could be a very useful tool. It could be used in the future to help people understand their brain's responses to stress. Rebecca Saeger: Social intelligence should pervade our thinking about the mind and brain. She says the ability to think about other people's thoughts or internal states is very large. We're using our ability to make sense of others' minds, she says, to understand complex ideas. Saeber: The debate about whether this capacity for thinking about others' thoughts is not shared with other animals has not been resolved on the origin of this problem for psychology, which has been going on since the '70s.

The fundamental theorem of calculus can be used to solve any differential equation. The product rule says take the derivative of [INAUDIBLE] that is e to the minus t is one. So the two terms from the product rule are the two term in the differential equation, which is dy dt. The derivative of that product is one term will be y and the otherterm will be q. That's a remarkable formula for the solution to a basic differential equation and it's a key example in differential equations. this isn't so practical. Tangent parabola, quite practical. Higher order terms, less-- much less practical. But the formula is beautiful because you see the pattern, that's really what mathematics is about. They all fit that pattern and when you add up all the terms, if you have a nice function, then the approximation becomes perfect and you would have equality. And those are the best functions of mathematics and exponential is of course one of them. OK that's calculus. Well, part of calculus. GILBERT STRANG: Differential equations is the big application of calculus. He says it's interesting to see what information and ideas from calculus actually get used in differential equations. Strang: You really do need to know basic derivatives. The derivative of e to the x, which is e toThe x. The fundamental theorem involves the derivative and the integral, he says. He shows you how to take into account the bending of a curve to get closer to the point where the derivative is close to the original.

What makes one car different from another is the brand and we're going to talk more about perceptual maps where our brand is positioned in the marketplace relative to our competitors. It's not a question of whether or not our product is expensive or whether it's a high quality the issue is the perception of the target market the people that we want to buy our product. is that going to cost a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to do more intercept in multiple cities and get approximately 1500 respondents now when we do focus groups we also do multiple rounds of focus groups because each round is iterative so we learn from the first round of focus group and then we incorporate that in the next round before we do the quantitative research. i recommend that do the focus groups then we're going to do quantitative research before that now both of those focus groups and questionnaires qualitative and quantitative research as i describe that. Marketing is about four things creating communicating delivering and exchanging value. Value is a function of the price the quality and the benefits so let's make sure that we don't think that value means low price. For something to be of a good value it doesn't need to be a low price it could be a high price but it's a very high quality and it has a lot of benefits do you agree who could explain that further good tell us your name theresa bad um i mean would you consider that clothing yes.

The process whereby you go from the extended primary sequence to the folded structure is called protein folding. It's not simple because what you're doing is you're solving a massive energy diagram, where as you fold a structure up, you're trying to maximize all those non-covalent forces for maximum thermodynamic stability. What I'm showing you here is what's known as the alpha helix, an ordered structure exclusively made up from the hydrogen-bonding interactions of the peptide backbone. well-aligned as the rest of the structure. And then that defect gets propagated into all the fibrils and results in the weakening of the bones. Either the collagen fails to form properly, or the collagen, when it forms, it has much less mechanical stability. So I think that's a good place to stop and I'll pick up next time with hemoglobin.

eigenvalue equation. This is the result of acting on phi with the energy operator, and this is the energy eigenvalue. Cool? So, the upside here is that when we have a central. potential, when the system is rotationally. invariant, the potential energy is invariant under rotations. Then the energy commutes with the angular momentum squared. And so, we can find common eigenfunctions. When we use separation of variable, the resulting energy eigenevalue equation becomes nothing but a 1D energy eigs equation. would've got the same equation. And that means that the energy eigenvalue can depend on l, but it can't depend on m, right? So, that means for each m in the allowed possible values, l, l minus 1, [? i ?] minus l-- and this is 2l plus 1 possible values-- for each of these m's, the energy is the same. And so, here we have a degeneracy. And this degeneracy isn't fixed by rotational invariance. And why is this the right thing? Rotational symmetry? The form of this differential equation is, OK, it's not different in any deep way, but it's a little bit easier. As rho goes to infinity, which terms dominate? Well, this is not terribly important. That term is gonna dominate. If l is equal to 0, then this is the only term that survives, so we'd better make sure that that behaves gracefully. So, this tells us, having done this in analysis, we should write that rho to the l plus 1 times e to the minus root epsilon rho times some remaining remaining terms. nice bit of experimental data, but we've discovered the energy is, in fact, not just independent of m, but it's independent of l, too.

Summary:
Milton Friedman: What really matters to you in a consumption decision is not so much your current income, but what you expect to get on average during your lifetime. So you don't consume all you have because you know there are many years ahead of you where income will be lower than your consumption needs. So when you start thinking about consumption in those terms, what really matters, then, is total wealth more than income. How wealthy you are will pin down more or less the consumption you have. expect to inherit or whatever, minus the debts you have. So very much as we discussed in the previous lecture in the context of asset pricing, the expected present discounted value of the cash flows of all the assets you have, that's your financial wealth. You have more financial wealth, even if you have no income today, you will probably borrow against that wealth to the extent that you can. And so you're going to fund the consumption, which is above your current income just because you have morefinancial wealth. In fact, the very rich seldom sell assets to fund consumption. not be worth a lot simply because interest rates are very high. The discounting of the future cash flows is very high, and in that environment, investments that give you a return, a quick return, are worth more than things that have a pay-off in the very long run. So the decision, for example, of buying a machine needs to look at the price of the machine right now and then at the expected present discounted value of the cash flows, OK? So let's think a bit more carefully about that decision. was expansionary. That was contractionary. But it was overwhelmed or offset, more than offset by the improvement in the outlook that you had. And that also happens with monetary policy. Countries that have high inflation problems and so on sometimes get-- and they have to go through dramatic tightenings. Yes, most of them get very short-lived recession. But sometimes they are veryshort-lived recessions because eventually the reduction of the instability caused by high and unstable inflation sort of ends up dominating any direct contractionary effect. Expectations play a big role in the decision of all economic actors. We'll look at investors, asset pricing and so on. We will develop a life-cycle theory of consumption, which says people know early in life that they have a lower income than they will have later on. Traders, given the opportunity, will make a difference, that will do a lot with wealth, CABALLERO says. "There is a lot of interesting stuff that is hidden in that autonomous component of consumption," he says.

Summary:
it doesn't work so let's kind of look at them in the atas model right we have this Keynesian view. We have our kind of a classical view and we have our what would be called supply-side view. There's more views than that obviously but we're just gonna look at these these three stir them the three main ones. We're at some full employment level of output YF and here we are initially we're in some recession right we're at output level say y1 and some price level just call it P l1. F and basically this guy says look we know eventually the short-run aggregate supply curve will increase and we go to the full employment level of output if you guys engage in this type of policy over here. The deficit today means that at some point in time in the future you're going to have to increase taxes so you can kind of think of it as the budget deficit over two different time periods. In fact thanks to interest it won't be 20 that you have to borrow or in raise taxes for it'll actually be like say 30 all right. doesn't make any sense I'm not gonna do that I'm gonna goof off. I don't want it because they're facing a marginal tax rate that's really really high so which view is Keynesian new classical supply? I'll write the paper and win the Nobel Prize and I can go to Sweden and get the nice little bitty gold medallion that I couldn't wear around my neck for the rest of life at such a such recession. alright this is the end of test three material I will. CNN's John Defterios takes a look at three different views of fiscal policy. Keynes says we can change aggregate demand in such a way that we can make. Defterio: Once you actually start spending money it becomes difficult to take money away. He says once you start giving people something taking out money now becomes very very difficult. The crowding out problem and the crowded out problem are real, he says, and they're going to get worse as we go along. The problem is that people are borrowing money to go to school and you're now taking money out of your savings.

Summary:
We'll find the Heisenberg equations of motion and solve them for a particular case today. We start with the time evolution. We found that, whenever we declare that states evolve in time in that way, they satisfy a first order time differential equation of the Schrodinger form. We discussed that in recitation on Thursday. This unitary operator you've been seeing that from the beginning of the course in some sense, that you evolve energy eigenstate. It's an interesting thing, and really that will be good enough. The Schrodinger equation is there. OK so now let's solve this. We'll go through three cases. Case one, h is time independent. So H of t is really H like that. So what do we have? ih bar. Let's write dU dt is equal H times whole thing is the same. So this is something very useful and we'll need it. One more comment, expectation values. We just say the expectation value of As is equal to the Heisenberg expectation value. the Schrodinger operator? PROFESSOR: You have to speak louder. OK, comments. At t equals 0 A Heisenberg becomes identical to A Schrodingers. When t is equal to 0, U of t-- of 0 0 is the operator propagates no state, so it's equal to the identity. So if this is happening, the two Hamiltonians are identical. And we'll have the chance to check this today in a nice example. And this goes Hs of t1 and t2 commute with each other. Solving for the time dependent Heisenberg operators is the same as finding the time evolution of all states. So you have this. And then you write Xh is equal to A cosine omega. t plus B sine omega t where A and B are some time independent operators. At time equals 0, the Heisenburg operators are identical they to the Schrodinger operators. So any expectation value of any power of X and P that you will want to find its time dependence, just put those Heisen Berg operators, and you will calculate things with states at time equals0. variables in, it just becomes identical to the Schrodinger Hamiltonian. All right, so that's all for today. I hope to see in office hours in the coming days. Be here Wednesday 12:30, maybe 12:25 would be better, and we'll see you then. [APPLAUSE] We'll be back at 12:50 on Wednesday, and be here at 1:30 on Thursday. Back to Mail Online home. back to the page you came from. Professor: We're going to look at this unitary time evolution and calculate this operator u, given the Hamiltonian. Then we will look at the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics. Professor: If you have a time dependent Hamiltonian that actually commutes with itself, the fact that it's time independent doesn't make it fail to commute at different times. And you will discuss later on as we do the nuclear magnetic resonance, which is more interesting in which it rotates and therefore it's not that time dependent.

Summary:
Rousseau: Amour-propre only arises in society and is the true cause, he believes, for our discontents. He distinguishes it from another disposition that he calls amour de soi-meme, a sort of self-love. "Amour- Propre is merely a sentiment that is relative," he says, "artificial and born in society which moves each individual to value himself more than anyone else" The desire for recognition is at the root of our sense of justice, he says. Borat: I want to talk about my favorite part of the Second Discourse, a book that never grows old. Borat: Inequality is for Rousseau far more what we might call "the moral and psychological injuries of inequality" than the material aspects of the phenomenon. He says Rousseau very much takes the side of the poor and the dispossessed but it isn't property, or poverty rather, that rouses Rousseau's anger as it is the attitudes and beliefs shaped by inequalities. general will and how Rousseau sees it as a sort of collective answer to the problem of the securing of individual liberty. So meditate on that if you like for the next day. If you like, you can read the rest of the book tomorrow. It's a great read and a great way to start a new day. I hope you'll join me for a cup of tea and a glass of wine in the next few hours. I'm looking forward to seeing you in the morning. Rousseau's Second Discourse deals with the origins of inequality. He says amour-propre is the first and most durable cause of inequality for Rousseau. Rousseau speculates about how the passion of vanity was born. The passion to be seen is at the root of justice and virtue, he says, yet we know this passion is easily manipulable by those who wish to convince us of its value, he adds. The book is available in French, English, German and Spanish.

Summary:
The bias is a decreasing function as the model complexity. So we say that the bias is large, it's because the model is not expressive enough. So that means that if your model is more expressive, then your bias should decrease. So this is the bias. And now let's think about how do you draw the in some sense. Because for example, suppose you believe that this is a U curve. Then should you try even bigger models, bigger family of models? Because you kind of believe that it will be even worse. So you should just try even more in the middle. fifth-degree polynomial, and then I'm going to try quadratic. So linear model. I guess, you can probably see, guys, what will happen. So you can see that there's a large training error, training loss or training-- let's call it loss just for consistency. So what you really will fit, like if you minimize the error on the training data with this so many training examples, then what you will get is probably something like this. It's not like necessarily matching exactly the ground truth, but you have a small fluctuation. going to discuss this more next time. So the high level thing is just that something else is driving the norm to be small. Thanks. Going to talk more about this in the next few days.

So I didn't have time to explain this figure, which I think probably would be useful as a high level summary of what's happening. Like this is the forward path. This is how you define network and the loss function. So you start with some example x, and then you have some-- I guess, this is a matrix vector multiplication module, and you take x inner product multiplied with w and b. And then get some activation, the pre-activation. And you get some post activation.

"Perhaps there would've been more reforms in due time if radicals, like Lenin, weren't always stirring up trouble." "Your Honor, Lenin had seen his older brother Aleksandr executed by the previous tsar for revolutionary activity" how would I have sounded?" We can never be sure how things could've unfolded if different people were in power or different decisions were made, but to avoid the mistakes of the past, we must always be willing to put historical figures on trial. We must never forget that history is not an exact copy of the present, but it can be a guide to the future. It can be used to learn from the mistakes made in the past and to make better decisions in the present. It is never too late to put a historical figure on trial for their actions. Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, AKA Lenin, helped overthrow the Russian tsar Nicholas II in 1917. He founded the Soviet Union, one of the worst dictatorships of the 20th century. We can never be sure how things could've unfolded if different people were in power or different decisions were made.

Everything you need to know about atoms, you can tell a computer, and it can do it. Now molecules are much more complicated. And that's we're going to start on next time. We'll start with molecular orbital theory. I'm not going to be presenting the normal textbook approach. I'll present an interpretive approach, where you understand why things happen. The goal of this course is to give you the tools to interpret complicated phenomena. We have electronic structure and the hydrogen atom as a way of understanding what electronic structure is. When we go to molecular orbital theory, we take what we know about atoms, and build a minimally-complex interpretive picture, which is sort of a framework for understanding complicated molecular interactions. The relationship between the effective quantum number and the ionization energy of a state then provides a hydrogen-atom-based structural model for everything you can observe.

Summary:
need to know what gradient descent is. The bigger question we are trying to address here is that why many optimization algorithm. are designed for convex functions. But why they can still work for nonconvex functions? So why they still work and actually, pretty well in practice forNonconveX functions in deep learning. Of course, this is not a 100% statement because it depends on which function you are talking about, what you have, and so forth. But I'm just saying, for most of the cases in deep. learning, stochastic gradient descent or gradient descent seems to work pretty well. Strict-saddle condition is basically saying that you assume your function doesn't have this kind of somewhat subtle possible candidate of local minimum, right? So every point, whether it's a local minimum or not, can be told from examine only the first order gradient and the second order gradient, second order directives. So if you certify the condition, then you remove those pathological cases which requires high order derivatives. But there are also-- my bad. One, two doesn't tell you exactly whether a point is local minimum per se if you don't have that assumption. methodology also applies here when you talk about the Hessian. You just iteratively expand it, Taylor expand it into something like g of x plus some epsilon times some vector. And then if you have this, then this basically corresponds to v dot g square gxv. So if you apply these kind of techniques, you can get the. Hessian like this. So the quadratic form of the Hessia is equals to something like this, right? So we have to have this. And we know that the Hessians that are larger than 0 is equivalent to that. assume that the input are linearly separable, then there is a proof for this. And there are a bunch of other cases where you can have some partial results. Next week, in the next lecture, maybe the second half of next lecture,. I'm also going to give another result, which is somewhat more general. It applies to many different architectures, but it has other kind of constraints. First of all, it doesn't really show exactly these kind of landscape properties. It shows that these kinds of properties holds for a region, for a special region in the parameter space. We are going to start talking about the optimization perspective in deep learning for two lectures. In most of the cases, people observe that nonconvex functions in machine learning can be optimized pretty well by gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent. We're going to show some very, actually, simple cases where we can prove this. But I guess, as I mentioned, there is some caveat about whether you can even converge to a local minimum. So I'm not going to prove any of the theorems here.

If you're at $8,000 and you go out and earn another hundred dollars you're going to pay $10 and times but if you're making eighty six thousand dollars you need to have you earn another 100 dollars. a beautiful fiscal policy we have this new classical view of fiscal policy and we have those called the supply side now.

Taxes are one of three different kinds of tax we're gonna have aggressive so with our regressive tax as people earn more income base they are attacked a smaller amount of smaller percentage of the rounding. Sales tax dollar amounts as a percent of their income it's actually usually profit or loss so let's look at some important things here that were looking at tax especially when it comes to these progressive taxes. There's two important concepts here one is marvel happens [Music] so this marginal tax rate is the percentage change in taxes any tax paid from some changing our average tax rate.

Summary:
that we are going to be looking for in an estimator, trying to find them to be unbiased. But we'll see that it's actually maybe not enough. So unbiasedness should not be something you lose your sleep over. Something that's slightly better is the risk, really the quadratics risk, which is expectation of-- so if I have an estimators, theta hat, I'm going to look at the expectation of theta n minus theta squared. And so for different thetas, some estimators are better than others. The total variation distance between probability measures is central to probabilistic analysis. If the total variation between theta and theta prime is small, it means that for all possible A's that you give me, then P theta of A is going to be close to P theTA prime of A. The problem is that we don't know what the total variations is to something that weDon't know. The goal was to spit out a theta hat, which was close such that P thena hat was close to theta star. So here's the strategy. Just build an estimator. PhilipPE RIGOLLET: Let me write the set A star as being the set of X's such that f of X is larger than g of X. So that's the set on which the difference is going to be positive or negative. Rigollet: This, again, is equivalent to f ofX minus g ofX is positive. Everybody agrees? So this is the set I'm interested in. So now I'm going to split my integral into two parts, in A, A star. this constant is 0 for my purposes, or 25 if you prefer. All right. So we'll just keep going on this property next time. And we'll see how from here we can move on to-- the likelihood is actually going to come out of this formula. Thanks.

Click here to go to the show page where we'll be talking about the probability of winning the lottery. PhilipPE RIGOLLET: What I want is to have a small bias, hopefully a 0 bias. If this thing is 0, then we see that the estimator is unbiased. So if I were to repeat this 1,000 times, so every one of those 1,.000 times they collect 124 data points and then I'd do it again and again, then in average, the number I should get should be close to the true parameter that I'm looking for. So this is definitely a property examples.

the formula for this line is given by y is equal to x plus 1. Conditioned on x, this is the PDF of y. And because it's uniformly distributed and because expectation acts like center of mass, we know that the expectation should be the midpoint, right? And so to compute this point, we simply take the average of the endpoints, x plus1 plus x over 2, which gives us 2x plus 1 over 2. So this is py given x, y given x. And now we can look at this conditional PDF to figure out what this is.  memorizing formulas might seem like cheating, but there's a few important ones you should know. And it will help you sort of become faster at doing computations. And that's important, especially if you guys take the exams. So that's it. See you next time.

And moreover, we're told we should compute this variance by using something called the Law of Total Variance.

I want you to look for the motif of light in the Panther scene, and also track one particular word, and that word is savage. Charles Brockden Brown: The Enlightenment is a critique of a kind of impoverished view of mind or consciousness that over-relies on reason. We started to look at it a little bit with Barlow's [assumed spelling] Raven poem with Poe. The idea that in fact there is something wrong with reason as a faculty, and this can take a couple of forms. One is that all of those nice ideals that come along with the enlightenment may in fact be parasitic precisely on the kinds of negative types of thinking that they are designed to get rid of.

and optics, upon the principle of relative movement." We now know this was wrong, but scientific process happens in scientific environment. And I started this class by explaining that one needs to be open minded to learn and to study and to grow scientifically. And one has to question the assumptions, understand the assumptions when then go into measurements. So this is the first part of this chapter where we talk about tests. We will have a discussion of implications of special relativity as we move on from here. Markus Klute: We're starting a new chapter in which we look at tests and implications of special relativity. One experimental test is stellar aberration, which we discussed can be explained by special relativity and by velocity addition. In all of this experimentation and experimental verification, it's important to understand the importance of uncertainties in the scientific process overall, Klute says. He says one needs to be open minded and scientifically open minded to study and grow to the question of whether or not Einstein's theory is correct.

Many women were also important contributors to the anti-slavery movement, although they tended to have more subordinate roles. Many women’s rights advocates were fighting to overturn not just laws, but also attitudes. It was an international movement. Often American feminists travelled abroad to find allies, prefiguring the later transatlantic movement of other advocates for social justice like Florence Kelley and W.E.B DuBois. It is interesting to note that the U.S. ended slavery more than 50 years before it granted women the right to vote. in comments where you can also ask questions about today’s video that will be answered by our team of historians.

In the colonial era, most American women of European descent lived lives much like those of their European counterparts: They were legally and socially subservient to men. Lower and working class women were actually more equal to men of their own classes, but only because they were, like, equally poor. As production shifted from homes to factories, it shifted away from women doing the producing. This led to the so-called “cult of domesticity,” which like most cults, I am opposed to.

the same connection. The pion here is spin 0, and if you discuss this in the rest frame of the pion, the electron and the positron fly off in opposite directions, which means that the spin doesn't in align to 0. So that's why this is highly suppressed. It's not 0, because you can find-- you can put [INAUDIBLE] into a rest frame, where you're just basically looking at both particles from one side that was coming to you, and in that case, it's allowed. In quantum mechanics, the spin of a particle with a vector is quantized. You find that it's square root of f times s plus 1 in units of h-bar. If you want to get an eigenvalue with the physical state of particles, which axis are the right ones to choose-- or, sensible? There's no right and wrong in this discussion. It's not 0, because you can put [INAUDIBLE] into the rest frame, where you're just basically looking at both particles from one side.

poll, all examples of how the democratic principle behind sortition still survives today. Polls show that the principle of sortition is still very much alive and well in the United States today. The majority of Americans support sortition, with the majority of people in the U.S. voting in favor of it by a wide margin in the last presidential election in 2008. The most popular type of vote in the 2008 election was for the Democratic Party, followed by the Republican Party and the Libertarian Party. The Democratic Party won the popular vote. In the 5th Century BC Athens was a direct democracy that encouraged wide participation through the principle of ho boulomenos, or anyone who wishes. This meant that any of its approximately 30,000 eligible citizens could attend the ecclesia, a general assembly meeting several times a month. Some ancient philosophers, including Plato, disparaged this form of democracy as being anarchic and run by fools. Could reviving election by lottery lead to more effective government through a more diverse and representative group of legislatures?

Summary:
as a function of time. Here is the Fourier transform of a sine wave at 20 hertz. This is phase shifted so the cosine is a symmetric function or an even function. The sine is an odd function. In this case, the real part is 0. And the two peaks are in the imaginary part. If you look at the power spectrum of the square wave, you can see again it's got multiple peaks at regular intervals. It's a series of peaks, because it's a periodic signal. The Fourier transform of a square wave, of this square wave of with 100 milliseconds, is a sinc function. If we take that pulse and we make it narrower, 25 milliseconds, then you can see that the sincfunction, it's the same sinc. function, but it's just stretched out in the frequency domain. As you make the pulse in time longer, the bandwidth gets smaller. And it turns out that the product of the width in time and thewidth in frequency is just a constant. problem with that? Why might that be a bad idea? Yeah. So instead of multiplying this signal by square pulses, we sample the signal by applying it by little things that look like little smooth functions, like maybe a Gaussian, or other functions that we'll talk about do an even better job. OK, so that process is called tapering, multiplying your data by a little [AUDIO OUT] paper that's smooth, unlike a square window. And we're going to come back to that, how to really do that right, on Thursday. correlation of this function with itself at different time lags. If we do that, you get a 1 at 0 lag and 0 at any other lag. So that's the autocorrelation function of Gaussian noise. All right, now what is the power spectrum? So we can take this thing-- and, remember, when we plot the power [AUDIO OUT] just plot the square magnitude of just the positive frequencies. Why do we only have to plot thesquare magnitude about that? OK. over the sampling rate and another copy sitting up here. The sampling rate needs to be greater than twice the bandwidth of the signal. These copies of the spectrum are too close to [AUDIO OUT] and they overlap. That overlap is called aliasing-- a-l-i-a-s- i-n-g. Now that's an amazing claim. Right? You have a time. All right, it's wiggling around. What this is saying is that I can sample that signal at regular intervals and completely ignore what's happening between those samples, have no knowledge. sample the signal in the time domain and then add a bunch of zeros to it before you Fourier transform. And that gives you finer samples in the frequency domain. And I'll show you in more detail how to do this after we talk about tapering. And it's very simple code actually. Matlab has built into it the ability to do zero-padding right in the FFT function. OK, let's actually just stop there. I feel like we covered a lot of stuff today. Last time, we covered Fourier series and the Fourier transform. Today, we're going to talk about the convolution theorem, noise and filtering Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem and spectral estimation. Next, we'll move on to spectrograms and an important idea of windowing and tapering, time bandwidth product, and some more advanced filtering methods. And we'll end the series with a look at some of the techniques we've used in the past to analyze time-series signals.

We hope to see you in the next edition of Java 8, which is scheduled to be released later this year. For more information, visit the official Java 8 website or follow us on Twitter at @joshjenson and @jenniferjenson. For the latest Java 8 news, visit our news page. The science of classical mechanics establishes an important principle of cause and effect. Newton's Laws of Motion established the scientific principle of analyzing observed phenomenon through the use of clearly articulated mathematical models rather than through intuition. Developing a command of mechanics is a powerful tool for understanding the world around us. 8.01 assumes a strong background in high school level physics and mathematics, so a previous course in calculus is not a prerequisite. It is a rigorous and technically challenging course aimed at MIT undergraduates. In each of these lessons, you will find a series of short lightboard videos that will help you understand concepts.

Turan's theorem is a foundational result in graph theory. It says that every n-vertex. graph G contains a clique on at least this many vertices. So here's the example. Let us take the n vertices and split them into equal parts. And there are r parts, so here in this illustration r equals to 3. And let's put in all the edges between parts, but no edge within a part. So this is called the complete r partite graph. minus 1 minus 1 over r times n. And this quantity here equals to r. So there's a strict equality sign here. In particular, G has a clique of size strictly greater than r, and that finishes the proof of Turan's theorem. Turan’s theorem is a important and foundational result in graph theory. And it's a start of a subject that we now call extremal graph theory, concerning what can you say about a graph that has certain properties, like not having a large clique? In this video, we'll look at an application of the probabilistic method to graph theory. An independent set in a graph is a subset of vertices with no two adjacent. The Caro-Wei theorem says that every graph G contains a large independent set. We'll see an application and some ways to interpret this result. The video will be available on CNN.com and the CNN iReport app from 10 a.m. to 11 a. m. ET on Monday.

1 kg of rice can be produced from 1 comma 2 plus 1 minus t 2 comma 1, and this is what additivity is if this 1 unit of input 2. So, 100 units we can produce by replicating this process 100 times. And again 50 times we will use the second process. And if we define the t dash by 100 is equal to t, then we can say 1 kg of Rice can beproduced by t 1 comma2 plus 1minus t 2 commas 1. And this will give us 1 kg using this t dash. is possible, then we say that technology exhibits additivity. Another related, but it may sound different let us say, if it is technologically feasible to produce y amount of output, then it is also technologically possible to produce  y plus y dash. This is example of convexity; let us talk about additivity first. So, let us look at it. . What it means? We have taken example where 1 unit of output can be produced using 2 units of input 1 and 2 unit of input 2, we have used different symbols there. feasible here, y is taking care of not only inputs but also output. The combination is all given here and this exhibits convexity. This is a simple example of how to make a complex shape. The shape can be any shape at any time. It can be either a shape or a shape-shift shape. It is possible to combine two shapes to create a shape that looks like a shape shape. For example, the shape could look like the shape of a circle or a circle. If certain amount of output can be produced by given amount of inputs, then the same combination of input puts can also be used to produce less. The key word is feasibility technology. So, if it is feasible to produce half kg of curd from 1 kg of milk, then it is possible to produce 250 grams of curD from 1kg of milk. The second is no free lunch. At least 1 input is required to produce some output, or more than you know more than 1 kind of output. Third is non reversibility, what it means is that a production process cannot be reversed.

The Great Wall began as multiple walls of rammed earth built by individual feudal states during the Chunqiu period to protect against nomadic raiders north of China and each other. Under the Han Dynasty, the wall grew longer still, reaching 3700 miles, and spanning from Dunhuang to the Bohai Sea. The wall was formidable but not invincible. Both Genghis and his son Khublai Khan managed to surmount the wall during the Mongol invasion of the 13th Century. main body and expanding this remarkable monument to human achievement. Main body is made up of three parts: the head, the torso, and the legs. The main body of the main body is the most important part of the body. The second part is the lower body, which includes the legs, the arms, the legs and the feet. The third part is made of the lower torso, which is the largest body of its kind. The last part is called the lower legs, which are made of marble and marble. The Great Wall of China was granted UNESCO World Heritage Status in 1987. Originally built to keep people out of China, the Great Wall now welcomes millions of visitors each year. In fact, the influx of tourists has caused the wall to deteriorate, leading the Chinese government to launch preservation initiatives. New sections are still discovered every few years, branching off from the main body and expanding this remarkable monument to human achievement. In low Earth orbit, all sorts of structures, like bridges, highways and airports are visible, and the GreatWall is only barely discernible.

 vector, we have delta x over delta t i hat. And this component here is what we call the component of the average velocity. And, again as before, this component can be positive, zero, or negative depending on the sine of delta x. And the key point here is that average velocity depends on whatever time interval you're referring to. So that's our definition of average Velocity. And now what we want to do is consider what happens in the limit as delta t becomes smaller and smaller. And that will enable us to introduce our concept of instantaneous velocity. The average velocity depends on the time interval t to t plus delta t while the person has displaced a certain amount of vector delta r. So, as a vector, we have delta x over delta t i hat. This component here is what we call the component of the average velocity. And, again as before, this component can be positive, zero, or negative depending on the sine of delta x. And now what we want to do is consider what happens in the limit as delta t becomes smaller and smaller. And that will enable us to introduce our concept of instantaneous velocity.

Summary:
this what is the English statement here it is the angular of velocity frame B with respect to frame a right okay so we saw that for the first time now a little bit on the low of angular velocity that you've seen in previous classes but we we Plunge in anymore um the first thing is can of Point have an angular velocity now can a frame have a velocity kind of no because if a frame's rotating some point different points will have different velocities so yeah a frame can have a Velocity but doesn't really mean much and you tell me which point in the frame you're referring to right. If I change the order in which I add angles they don't add up right so if I said 45° up and I'm going to trade 45° my arms up here right why is the angle adding up here a has something changed over the weekend if I turn 45° anyway. But infinite decimal angles do add up you remember this you did this in physics. If I rotate about one axis a certain amount 30° and then rotate about another axis 30° right if I reverse the sequence they don’t add up. But it turns out that here if I take a very tiny rotation not 90° but like. 1° then the sequences do actually add up okay. of thing you need to kind of walk around with a book you know and people will think you're nuts but you know do that and you'll see that the angles kind do add up you get it. Angle of velocity is a measure of the rate of change of angle so it's a d Theta. It's a tiny angle get it in a moment of time right in a very tiny moment oftime so angular of velocity does add up so you can treat it as a vector in the math. here so will you please expand it for me what does that come out to be this is the left hand side of that formula right and we'll do the right hand side separately and show that the two are the same I'm trying to prove it to you right so I'm not you know I'm doing just very boring stuff but we need to do it just establish it what is d by a d by DT of U1 cosine Theta it is U1 do cosine theta right minus U Theta do sin Theta. yeah okay using um frames uh using angle of velocity so the problem was we have the ground, the spider and the Frisbee. We characterize this situation with three parameters okay and the parameters are the positions of the center of the frisbe right and the distance of the spider. And the angle of theSpider from theCenter of the Fr Isbee right and assuming the spider is only moving in a straight line with respect to the FrIsbee away then we just need a distance. yeah sorry and plus this thing okay we'll end now because Professor Socrates needs to take over this is it this is correct acceleration of P acceleration of Q with respect to B Oiler coris centripedal and you know why it doesn't go to zero because I'm not taking a Omega B cross a omeg B. I'm taking a omega B cross this whole term which is at 90° to a OmegaB got it got it? Yeah sorry and Plus this thingOkay we'llend now because professor Socrates need to takeover. Last week we looked at the we first saw our first magic formula which you've probably forgotten because it was a wonderful weekend so I'll remind you and um then from there we will uh resolve the spider problem and then uh we're going to solve uh the super magic formula. The Machinery I provided you is powerful enough to solve pretty much any kinematics problem because it's based purely on Geometry angular velocity is a kind of a madeup concept that just simplifies the math and it's kind of intuitive stuff.

"Unlockable" is ambiguous because there are two "un-"s. "Un-" can combine with either a verb or an adjective. " unlockable" consists of three morphemes, a prefix, a stem, and a suffix. It's not a complete description of what's happened either, but it is also those trees, or those trees represent something, namely the order in which you did things. "John walked up the stairs," "Mary looked up the stairwell," "John" and "Mary" are sentences. In many languages, including Latin, you have to say, "About what are you talking?" In English, you always bring it along with the question word to the beginning of the sentence. "Who" is supposed to be the direct object of "you are talking to" this person, so it's like, "to whom are youtalking"? "To whom areyou talking?" sounds fancy and snobbish, but still right, according to the linguist, who says it's not his go-to way to say this. will find the red book" for example, we'll see that syntax treats that string, "The red book," as a unit. It's OK to take a substring like that and put it together with another similar substring conjoined with the word "and" so you can say things like, "I will find thered book and the blue pencils" But "find the red I will book, leave the blue I will pencils." No. Can't do this with just any random three-word string. the fact that it contains a noun. So when we put together "red" and "book," what we get has properties that are determined by the fact that they contain a noun, if there were no noun, it wouldn't have those properties. Similarly, with "the red book," the things that can go in that slot, there are various kinds ofThings that can be larger or smaller. What they all contain is a noun; we're going to name that thing after those kinds of units. We'll give it the label "noun" Kind of like when we added "un-" to "lock" and got "unlock" kind of example that I was exploiting in the first slides I was showing you about syntax. Notice, for example, that if I say I will wake up the cats and you're astonished as you might well be, you can't say "Up the cats?" You cannot say, "I will walk the stairs up," I think. So "up the cats" is not a prepositional phrase. We need different structures for these verb phrases, and we will develop them. I was a way, waking the cats up, it's a little bit like painting the cats red. construct syntactic trees for strings of words. It's often the case that we get ambiguities like the "unlockable" ambiguity. There is more than one way to combine things. And what we'll do is develop tests that allow us to see which way we've combined words in different ways. And we'll find cases where, depending on in what order you combine things, you get different meanings, and our tests will combine with that. All right. We will do this again on Tuesday. "Apparently This Matters" is CNN Radio's weekly, offbeat look at stories you saw on CNN.com. This week, Jarrett ponders the meaning of the word "unlockable" "Unlockable," means either it's possible to unlock it, or it is not possible to lock it," Jarrett says. "Un-" combines with verbs and makes adjectives that mean more or less "not (adjective) " " Unfortunate" means not the adjective, whatever it is.

The goal is to understand solar cell conversion efficiency, which is the ratio of output to input energy. For most solar cells, this breaks down to the following progression, from the solar spectrum to charge collection. After we get through the fundamentals, we'll be in a good position to understand the different technologies and finally the cross-cutting themes. The lecture will focus on charge separation, incorporating elements of either side but mostly focused on Charge separation. The final lecture will be on the diode under illumination. Solar cell researchers often do is they say, OK, let's normalize the current by the area to get a current density. At the y-intercept, there is maximum current a lot of it, right? That's the maximum power point. This is the point at which the solar cell is producing the maximum amount of power output. It's where this blue curve reaches a maximum. That is where the solarcell is outputting the maximum Amount of Power. The maximum power is truth in advertising. point divided by the solar insulation, fill factor being defined as the ratio of Vmp Imp product divided by Voc Ioc product. These parameters right here are fairly easy to measure using the solar simulator that you just put together. And so from an engineering point of view, when we break the solar cell output down into these three parameters so that we can better understand what's going wrong with our solar cell, we can get a better idea of what's wrong with the device, the professor says. pay more for a high-efficiency cell because I'm using less area, you can use this type of calculation to get to the answer quickly. This is a really back-of-the-envelope envelope engineering approach to estimating costs of a solar system. So I think this is a great place to stop. And if anybody has an idea, a fun idea, for a class project, I'd invite you to give a pitch up here at the front of class, or you're welcome to send it on an email to the class listserv. The total system efficiency is the product of each individual component going on here. When we reverse bias our device, notice the separation of the quasi-Fermi energies. As the barrier height decreases, we have a decrease of the built-in electric field. That's why the depletion width decreases. And the opposite happens here under reverse bias. So getting to the point where you can set up a pn-junction dark, this is the only case in which we have carriers traveling from right to left. And it's happening because we're using that battery in the dark to change the chemical potential.

We'll also show you how to get the most out of your college degree, including how to apply your knowledge to the real world. In the year 2000, four-year college grads actually earned more with their entry jobs than they're earning today. Changing technology has made wages rise more at the top, but has held wages down for a lot of other jobs. A third set of factors has to do with slower economic growth, slower productivity growth and slower dynamism in the U.S. economy, says Tyler Cowen. He says there is less demand for new labor and that makes it harder for a new college graduate to get the job he or she wants.

non-satiation, but let us take example of your monotonicity, monotonicism, and what would it imply? In other words, let us say that is clear that, that is through definition, but it if we translate it into indifference map what we will get that the indifference curve has to be a downward-sloping curve. So, from here we learned that indifference curve have to be downward sloping. What else? Anything else themonotonicity would tell us? All the bundles here are preferred over the original two bundles, why because here at this point utility is increasing in this direction. So, it is convex. Convexity is satisfied, continuity is satisfied. rationality axioms are satisfied. What is not satisfied here is monotonicity or local non-satiation is satisfied everywhere except at this bliss point, is it clear? So, now, what we will do we will start talking about mathematical problems, optimization, and all. So, the first we learned rationality, rationality axioms - completeness, reflexivity and transitivity. And when our when someone’s preference exhibit these three properties, what does it mean that he is able to completely rank all his choices all his potential choices, with also possibility, with possibility that there are more than one bundle at some ranks this is a possibility. One thing also I should add that he will be able to rank only if he has finite consumption set and also what we have learned that this will translate into a utility function. So, now, what we will do we will start talking about mathematical problems, optimization and all.

Summary:
If you have a complex polyhedron, we found general unfoldings. They work. We proved one of them. If you want an edge unfolding, that's the centuries-old open problem. For non-convex polyhedra, we know this is too much to hope for. Even if it's topologically convex, there's not always an edge unfolds. But for general unfolding, we don't know. So today's lecture is actually mostly about these two open problems and different variations of it. compute the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices, something like this picture, except you don't know what it looks like in 3D. You know every edge must be a shortest path. So the edges are some subset of these guys. And so you've got lots of little convex polygons here. We know it must make a convex polyhedron. If it made two, Cauchy's rigidity theorem would tell you that they're the same. So even once you fix the gluing, you know that there's a unique convex realization. Theory of the facet-path: A path that alternates between visiting faces, triangles, and vertices. Professor: It's an open problem for something like a cube where you actually have quadrilateral faces. He says the claim is facet- Paths always exist for any triangulated, connected surface. The theorem works not only for a polyhedron-- it works for any manifold, any sort of locally, two-dimensional thing, he says. "It's useful because then, we'll get to Mickey Mouses, as we'll see"

Summary:
When a particle's undergoing circular motion, it has a velocity that you can describe, which is the tangential motion around the circle. And it also has an angular velocity, which we define as being in a direction that's perpendicular to that direction of rotation. Let's now look at rotation in an arbitrary plane. So if I have a plane like this and I have some particle traveling in a circle like this, then it will see this rotation with these directions. So we can define d theta dt to be the component of the angular velocity omega z. dt. So when a particle's undergoing circular motion, it has a velocity that you can describe, which is the tangential motion around the circle. And it also has an angular velocity, which we define as being in a direction that's perpendicular to that direction of rotation. And so this is another way that we can write the velocity and connect it back to the angular velocity. And now that we have defined this omega z, the component of the angular Velocity, we can rewrite the velocity as just being equal to r times omega z still in that theta hat direction. as being in the counterclockwise direction. Whereas if I have another observer down here and they're looking up at this plane, they'll see the motion as being clock wise. And so you can see we have a need for a more formal definition for the rotation of this. So what we're going to do is use the right hand rule to define a direction that tells you both the direction it defines the plane and it also tells you what the positive direction of rotation is for that plane.

Summary:
When they were in the period of statistical NLP that we've seen in other places in the course. And then the idea began, can we start with just data about translation i.e. sentences and their translations, and learn a probabilistic model that can predict the translations of fresh sentences? So suppose we're translating French into English. We can say, what's the probability of different English translations? And then we'll choose the most likely translation. And we're not really expecting you to understand the details here. But I did then want to say a bit more about how decoding was done in a statistical machine translation system. In the period from about 1997 to around 2013, statistical machine translation was a huge research field. In 2014, the first modern attempt to build a neural network from machine translations and encoded-decoder model. Within two years' time, Google had switched to using neural machine translation for most languages. There are still lots of difficulties which people continue to work on very actively. And you can see more about it in the Skynet Today article that's linked at the bottom. We'd like to translate languages for which we don't have much data. model end to end on parallel sentences. And it's the entire system rather than being lots of separate components as in an old fashioned machine translation system. So these neural network architectures are called sequence to sequence models or commonly abbreviated seq2seq. And they involve two neural networks. There's one neural network that is going to encode the source center. And we're going to feed it in directly as the initial hidden state for the decoder, or RNN. But we do the same kind of LSTM computations and generate a first word of the sentence. In neural machine translation we are directly calculating this conditional model probability of target language sentence given source language sentence. So we have a source sentence. And that's going to strongly determine what is a good translation. And so to achieve that, what we're going to do is have some way of transferring information about the source sentence from the encoder to trigger what the decoder should do. And the two standard ways of doing that are you either feed in a hidden state as the initial hidden state to the decoding, or sometimes you will feed something in. that can sometimes improve performance. And we actually have that trick in the assignment 4 system. And you can try it out. So we generate along and generate our whole sentence in this manner. And that's proven to be a very effective way of getting more information from the source sentence more flexibly to allow us to generate a good translation. I'll stop here for now and at the start of next time. I will finish this off by going through the actual equations for how attention works. In week four, we take a break from learning more and more on neural network topics, and talk about final projects, but also some practical tips for building neural network systems. Today's lecture is the primary content for what you'll be using for building your assignment 4 systems. In the early 1950s, there started to be work on machine translation. Claims were made that the computer would replace most human translators. When you go in for full scale production what will the capacity be? We should be able to do about with a modern commercial computer about one to two million words an hour.

Summary:
If you have a single photon, you always transfer momentum to the atom. But if you have two photons, the two momenta can cancel. This is actually a powerful method to avoid Doppler broadening in spectroscopy. For two-photon absorption, if the two laser beams are counter-propagating, the total momentum transfer is zero. If we arrange for the two photons to be absorbed from opposite directions, we reach the situation where the Dooppler shift is really zero. Coherence exists if there is a well-defined phase between two or more amplitudes. We can only observe it if else than the time integral over the energy difference between two levels. So therefore, when we are talking about coherence, how can we maintain longer coherence between energy levels? How can we create coherence in three level systems? This is actually intricately related to the fact that we can obtain more precise information about the energy levels. This is a very general introduction to coherence. The first form of coherence I want to discuss is the coherence involved in exciting atoms. of spontaneous emission. The system involves with the following operator, and this is the operator which completely describes the interaction of an atom with the electromagnetic field. The fact that we have a unitary evolution with this operator is 100% or 110% true. But this operator will actually lead to final states of the photon field, which may not have a specific phase. And this is actually what I want to work out with you in-- maybe even today, I think ten minutes may be enough-- what is really the information-- the phase information-- which we have in a photon, which has been spontaneously emitted. this is what we want to discuss on Wednesday. And this is what I referred to as the fundamental limit of spontaneous emission because we have not lost any coherence here. It's just if the phase is only imprinted in one particle-- one particle quantum physics sets us a limitation. Oh well, we can read out the phase phi. OK. Any question? To be continued on Monday. Back to Mail Online home. back to the page you came from. Click here to read the full interview. Professor: In almost all cases when you address atoms, you do two photon courses because a photon is scattered. In reality, it is a two photon process and not two single photon processes, he says. Professor: If you have any doubts about some subtleties about how is light absorbed and emitted, the correct answer is always obtained from the two-photon picture. He then asks the audience to guess how many terms you would expect when you do the most basic light atom interaction.

Summary:
most people in deep learning when we talk about GPUs, we're pretty much exclusively talking about NVIDIA GPUs. So to give you an idea of like what is the difference between a CPU and a GPU, I've kind of made a little spread sheet here. And there's a couple general trends to notice here. Both GPUs and CPUs are kind of a general purpose computing machine where they can execute programs and do sort of arbitrary instructions. But they're qualitatively pretty different. For GPUs we see that these sort of common top end consumer GPUs have thousands of cores. debate. So if you guys have AMD cards, you might be in a little bit more trouble if you want to use those for deep learning. And really, NVIDIA's been pushing a lot for deeplearning in the last several years. It's been kind of a large focus of some of their strategy. And they put in a lot effort into engineering sort of good solutions to make their hardware better suited forDeep learning. So in practice, you tend not to end up writing your own CUDA code for deepLearning. TensorFlow is a pretty safe bet for just about any project that you want to start new, right? Because it is sort of one framework to rule them all. However, you probably need to use it with a wrapper and if you want dynamic graphs, you're maybe out of luck. Some code ends up uglier but in my opinion, maybe that's kind of a cosmetic detail. If you're just writing research code, I think PyTorch is a great choice. But it's a bit newer, has less support out there, so it could be a bit of an adventure. Numpy is definitely CPU only. And you're never going to be able to experience or take advantage of these GPU accelerated speedups if you're stuck working in Numpy. So, kind of the goal of most deep learning frameworks these days is to let you write code in the forward pass that looks very similar to Numpy, but lets you run it on the GPU and lets you automatically compute gradients. TensorFlow has this magic line that just computes all the gradients for you. So now you don't have to go in and write your own backward pass yourself. different where we're actually building up this new computational graph, this new fresh thing on every forward pass. That's called a dynamic computational graph. For kind of simple cases, with kind of feed forward neural networks, it doesn't really make a huge difference, the code ends up kind of similarly. But I do want to talk a bit about some of the implications of static versus dynamic. And what are the tradeoffs of those two? So one kind of nice idea with static graphs is that because we're kind of building up one computational graph once, and then reusing it many times, the framework might have the opportunity to go in and do optimizations on that graph. is really great for research. If you're interested in production deployment, you should probably look at Caffe, Caffe 2 or TensorFlow. PyTorch is a great choice. But it's a bit newer, has less community support, less code out there, so it could be a bit of an adventure. So it's kind of unfortunately, there's not just like one global best framework, it kind of depends on what you're actually trying to do, what applications you anticipate. - Hello? Okay, it's after 12, so I want to get started. So today, lecture eight, we're going to talk about deep learning software. This is a super exciting topic because it changes a lot every year. But also means it's a lot of work to give this lecture. But as usual, a couple administrative notes before we dive into the material. So as a reminder the project proposals for your course projects were due on Tuesday. And again, when working on assignment two, remember to stop your Google Cloud instances.

B and C as against the infrequent one A. As a stepping stone toward cosine distance, which will behave quite differently, let's talk about length normalization. Given the vector u of dimension n, the L2 length of u is the sum of the squared values in that matrix. And then we take the square root. That's our normalization quantity there. And A and B are now close together. Whereas B and C are comparatively far apart. And that has come entirely from the normalization step. their generalizations to the real valued vectors that we're talking about. And the other class of methods that you might see come up are probabilistic methods which tend to be grounded in this notion of KL divergence. Now I've alluded to the fact that the cosine distance measure that I gave you before is not quite what's called the proper distance metric. To qualify as a proper distance metrics, a vector different choices that we could make, of all the options for vector comparison, suppose we decided to favor the ones that counted as true distance metrics. the results for "bad" using cosine distance in cell 12 and Jaccarddistance in cell 13. And I would just like to say that these neighbors don't look especially intuitive to me. It does not look like this analysis is revealing really interesting semantic information. But don't worry, we're going to correct this. We're going. to start to massage and stretch and bend our vector space models. And we will see much better results for these neighbor functions and everything else as we go through that material. Part 3 in our series on distributed word representations. We're going to be talking about vector comparison methods. To try to make this discussion pretty intuitive, I'm going to ground things in this running example. On the left, I have a very small vector space model. We have three words, A, B, and C. And you can see graphically that B and C are pretty close together. And A is kind of lonely down here in the corner, the infrequent one.

Summary:
Fluorescence is the absorption of light energy by a molecule. Luminescence is the emission of light in the absence of heat. There are different types of luminescence. And you'll get to see some of those varieties of luminecence in the next couple of slides. And it's not the last time that you're going to see them, so let's take a look at fluorescent dyes at the end of the electromagnetic spectrum in thenext couple of slide. The next few slides will show you how fluorescent proteins come from. The adaptive immune system is an amazing system where you can do combinatorial biology and basically recognize any target entity you're interested in. So we're going to focus exclusively on the B cells and the way that they mature to produce soluble antibodies. When you get a population of B cells that produce antibodies to a particular target, these may be what are known as polyclonal-- sorry, I should have written that up here-- A polyclona antibody, as might be suggested by the name, is an antibody that recognizes a molecular entity. The way you make antibodies is by injecting. the foreign agent or antigen that you want to make an antibody to. The organisms are adapted not to recognize their own proteins unless there's some disorder like an autoimmune disease. So you would inject the rabbit with a human epitope, so for example human actin, generate antibodies with a specificity for actin. Alternatively, you might want to made a different antibody for tubulin. You've really got two types of macromolecule that can be interacted with a fixed cell. DNA microarrays exploit the complementarity of DNA sequences. They can be used for profiling genetic material or for profiling not just DNA, but RNA. Fluorescence is a magnificent tool. We can use fluorophores as attached to antibodies. And the DNA microarray experiments show you how you can usefluorophores attached to DNA sequences, OK. And I'll see you in the next class. Technology. Technology is known as a DNA micro array has anybody heard of these? Yeah. DNA microarray experiments and how you can use it to profile disease states and cells versus healthy cells. And then at the beginning of the next class, I'll describe how you get information out of DNA microarrays. But at the end of the day, you're always using the fluorophores as the probes for where certain things are, OK. Fluorescence is a magnificent tool. We can use fluorophore on their own, or we can use them as attached to antibodies. Lambda Lambda: Fluorescence is a type of luminescence. He says it's used to illuminate life, to understand details of cellular activity. Lambda says fluorescence can also be used as reagents in diagnostics in all kinds of imaging modalities. He gives three lectures on fluorescence, including one that has even more imaging in it. Llamda: I like fluorescence so much because the images are so captivating. I'm going to redefine all these terms properly in a moment.

Summary:
In thermodynamics, we have many different transformation quantities that we keep track of. In material science, our most common independent variables are pressure and temperature. But for any transformation quantity, you can at least imagine, if not draw out on a piece of paper, state function surfaces corresponding to the quantity that you're trying to measure, independent variables corresponding to. the variables you're regulating, and a vertical distance, which is the vertical distance between these two surfaces. So this is illustration for an isobaric, isothermal transformation, and we're illustrating this for entropy. is a function of those independent variables that measures the transformation quantity for the transformation between two different phases. For example, in the case of water, the quantity of water in the solution is the ratio of the water volume to the volume of the solution. For the example, the total water volume is the sum of the volumes of the solutions of the two phases. The total water content is the product of the proportions of the different water volumes. For more information, see the Wikipedia article on water.  RAFAEL JARAMILLO: Today, we're going to discuss the many D's of thermodynamics. We'll talk about lowercase d, lowercase Greek d, and uppercase Greek D. Jaramillo: Of the three D's, the U.S. D is the one that contains the most physical, unstated assumptions. He says it is often the hardest for students to understand when you first encounter it. JARamillo says the D's are related to, but not identical to, meanings they have in mathematics.

In this video I'm going to be going over lung oscilation specifically the sites of where you osculate. We're going to go over normal breath sounds versus abnormal breath sounds. You can access the quiz and the notes over here or in the description below. In the next video I'll be performing an assessment on a patient and show you how to listen with your stethoscope to these sides. I'll also be going through the anatomy of the anterior part of the chest. chest in this illustration you have your right lung and your left lung and how I set up this illustration is that I wanted you to be able to see what is over the lungs. Whenever you're listening with your stethoscope you need to know where your clavicle is and certain intercoastal spaces because they correlate to which lobe of the lung you are listening to. We're going to start from top to bottom and compare sides and work our way down and we'll start right above the scapula right where the Apex is. patient's breathing in and breathing out so that's why you're hearing it on inspiration and expiration now it can sound similar to a parac cardial friction rub how do you tell the difference um if you are wanting to know is this the lungs or is this this the heart just listen have the patient hold their breath. If you can still hear that harsh grading sound it's the heart because they're holding their breath their lungs aren't moving so you've rolled out the lungs. That is lung occultation and normal breast sounds versus abnormal breast sounds. patient's back if you were to look inside look at the lungs you'll have the clavicle on the front then it comes around and it forms into your scapula and you have your left lung and your right lung they're on they're flip then compared to the anterior View and here as you can see you have mostly lower lobe that you're assessing and it's separated by your fissures here. We're going to go down to our fourth intercal space this is another big Landmark for specifically the right middle lobe.

Summary:
Sparta was the first state to be in command, or in control, or to be the leaders of a coalition of states. The Spartans gained a reputation of being--because they often fight against tyrants--they gain a reputation for being hostile to tyranny. The Spartan alliance most of the time was not clear how it came to exist, but perhaps the place to start is around 570C. The Peloponnesus suffered a defeat in the region of Arcadia to the north of Laconia in the seventh century. The average Spartan did not ever speak in the assembly, it appears. So it's not a democratic assembly, even though every single citizen is there, if he wants to be. Let me turn now to the ephors. These, according to Spartan tradition, were invented somewhat late in the development of the Spartan constitution. Although we don't have a clear picture of the way in which they were chosen, it is clear that there's a strong element of chance involved in selecting who was going to be an ephor. Athens is located in the southeastern portion of the Greek peninsula. The city is Athens; the region in which they live is Attica. The people are Athenians and that's an important point I think I made too. Everybody who is a citizen who lives in Attica is an Athenian, no matter if he lives sixty five or seventy miles away from the city. He's still an Athensian. So the rich-born, because they are pretty much the same in the early days of the polis, run the state in this official way. that there are the kinds of discontents that we have been talking about which find the leader in the form of a man who is an outstanding figure for some reason, who is willing to try to establish a tyranny. That it fails, I think, is an indication that the same forces haven't reached the power in Athens that they had reached in Megara, Corinth, Sicyon, and places like that. It's a warning about troubles ahead and I'll turn to those troubles in the next hour. All adult male Spartans were participants in the assembly. When a question was put to the Spartans, the way they responded was by shouting and banging on their shields. When it involved something fundamental like war and peace or alliances, then they would have to go to the assembly to get their approval. The Spartans got into this war with Tegea and they gained control of it. They claimed to have discovered the bones of the great Homeric hero, Orestes, and taken it away from Tegean.

Summary:
In 1951, the first nuclear reactor to produce electricity was the experimental breeder reactor, the EDR1. In 1953, President Eisenhower, he created something called atoms for peace. The first nuclear powered submarine, the USS Nautilus, was launched in 1954. The real heyday of nuclear was between 1960 to 1975, when there was a huge commercial energy boom. Today, China, India, and South Korea, they are the main players in this game. The main players are still, you would imagine, coal. About what I've mentioned? Awesome. So now we'll talk a little bit about reactor types. I'll just tell you guys about some of the main ones and how they work. How people like to divide up the reactor types is in generations. So boiling water reactors, or BWRs, comprise about 21% of the reactors that are located and working in the United States. PWRs are actually more important, if you will, than B WRs. But they are functionally essentially the same, and it's just slightly more complicated. These accidents. like you probably know that they exist, but like what happened during them? So if you do know, sorry, but if you don't know, you're about to know. So Three Mile Island, which is the first one, it happened in 1979 on March 28. So the core melted down, the reactor wasn't able to operate anymore. The next reactor accident that we were alive for, which was cool, was Fukushima Daiichi. So these reactors, I think these are pressurized water reactors. The main way of disposing of the spent fuel is putting it into spent fuel pools. This is an OK solution, except for the fact that we just have way too much spent fuel to be able to do this. Dry cask storage is a way to keep this spent fuel surrounded by an inert gas. repurposing is one other way of dealing with nuclear waste, which I think is the coolest option out of the bunch. is CNN Tech's weekly, offbeat look at what's happening in the world of nuclear power. NRC.gov with less grains of salt than usual. Or if one of these things really piqued your interest, you guys can take 22.04, which is really cool class that's offered here I think this spring, and if not next spring. But basically it's called nuclear power society. It's taught by a guy named Scott Kemp. He talks about all these things and in a lot of detail and slower. So yeah, cool. So thank you guys so much for coming. I know you guys could have slept an extra hour. Ka-Yen: "I walked into MIT not knowing a single thing about nuclear energy" "Nuclear creates 75 times less carbon emission than coal does, and 35 times less than natural gas" "You get 3.5 million times more energy than burning one kilogram of coal" "It can serve as a good baseload source of energy." "It might be better for the environment, but it's not really able to replace all coal and all the other forms of energy"

Summary:
Professor Steven Smith: I want to talk today about Aristotle's discovery of America. He says Aristotle's mixed constitution differs from ours still in certain important respects. Smith: For Aristotle, it is not the liberty of the individual so much as the functioning or functional well-being of the city that is the highest priority. In these parts of the Politics, Aristotle is very sketchy here about the structure, institutional structure, the make-up of the best regime, acknowledging the best men where the best rule. the back door. On Friday, let me just remind you, Il Principe. We'll study Machiavelli. On this very partisan note I conclude. On Thursday, we'll study the life of the Italian statesman and play a game of chess with him. We're going to see how well he can play the game of poker. I'm looking forward to it. I hope you'll join us for the game on Friday night at 8 p.m. ET on CNN. Aristotle's proposal for a mixture of oligarchy and democracy seems, in many ways, to anticipate, 2,000 years before the fact, Madison's call for a government where powers must be separated. Aristotle would have been critical of the American tendency to regard government as for the sake of business. He would have said the citizen of the best regime, he says, must be able to sustain war but only if it requires war and peace and Leisure does not simply mean simply enjoying your private moments.

SNLI and MultiNLI into Turkish. XNLI is a bunch of assessment data sets that is dev-test splits for more than a dozen languages. Those are human-created translations that could be used to benchmark multilingual NLI systems. So there's a wide world of tasks you can explore, and I think that makes NLI a really exciting space in which to develop original systems, and projects, and so forth. And those could be interesting for seeing how well a model can grapple with variation that comes in very specific and technical domains. SNLI is the Stanford Natural Language Inference Corpus-- MultiNLI, and Adversarial NLI. The premises are all image captions from the image Flickr30K data set. All the hypotheses were written by crowdworkers. The overall Fleiss kappa measured interannotator agreement was 0.7, which is a high rate of agreement. It's clear at this point, for example, that ensembles of deep learning methods are the best for this problem, says Christopher Potts.

In a perfectly competitive market, the firm is a price-taker. No matter how many units they produce, they're just going to be able to get that same market price. A firm in an imperfectly competitive market will have their own firm-specific demand curve. The price that they get in the market is higher than the marginal cost and the marginal revenue at that point. Folks are willing to pay more than that marginal cost, but you still have no motivation to produce more.

Summary:
Theory goes back to Roth and Whiteley, 1981-- good year. If you can find a stress that is nonzero on every particular strut or cable, then all of those things are effectively bars. Every infinitesimal motion holds the length of that edge fixed. This will actually always be true-- the corresponding linkage is rigid-- because I put in every edge is in there. If I turn them all into bars, this thing's not moving at all. Strut can have zero stress-- the weight is zero. A spiderweb is something where every edge is basically a cable. All of the edges can have a positive stress, and it will be in equilibrium. In spiderwebs, in fact, this is the same-- these two-- rigidity and positive stresses are the same thing. This is a brand-new result from this summer at [? OSMI ?] by Robert Lang and Alex Bateman. Here is an example of that-- a spiderweb, so to speak, but drawn visually. And you turn it into a crease pattern, fold it flat and it works. Theorem: All pairwise distances between vertices increase or stay the same. Key to proving it is by making the theorem stronger. Tensegrities will force things to be expansive. So if initially you're non-crossing, you will be non-Crossing forever. That really makes life easier, because crossings are hard to think about. This lets you not worry about crossings. How do I worry about distances increasing? Tensegrity. You compute an equilibrium stress, which is easy to do by linear programming, and draw-- you can directly construct from that the 3D lifting. still buy them at the hardware store. That's it. You can't buy them online. You have to buy them from the store. They are not available online. They can be bought at the store, but you have to pay for them in cash. They're not available on the internet. You must buy them in the store to get them. You cannot buy them on the Internet. They must be bought from the hardware stores. That is it. They have to be bought in the stores. Rigidity is really about the lack of motion. In infinitesimal motion, you can think about this in the absence of a motion. You need some smoothness. If there's a way to get started moving, that doesn't actually mean you could actually move. So we're going to need some linear algebra. That's one thing that's useful. So the idea is we think about rigidity-- does a linkage move or not-- to the first order. First order means first derivative.

Summary:
Deep Blue’s triumph over Garry Kasparov in 1997 was the first time a machine had defeated a sitting champion. Today, chess software is capable of consistently defeating the best human players. But just like the game they’ve mastered, these machines are products of human ingenuity. And perhaps that same ingenuity will guide us out of this apparent checkmate, as it did in the case of chess greats such as Benoît Mitterrand and Toulouse-Laffitte. Chess has been known as a tool of military strategy, a metaphor for human affairs, and a benchmark of genius. The game was originally known as chaturanga– a Sanskrit word for "four divisions" With its spread to Sassanid Persia, it acquired its current name and terminology– "chess," derived from "shah," meaning king. Chess-playing computers had been developed for decades, but Deep Blue’s triumph over Garry Kasparov in 1997 was the first time a machine had defeated a sitting champion.

Transformer part is extremely extremely important so there's a debate a little bit what was the most influential part of making uh CHP and large language model possible uh Transformer is definitely a significant part of it and and I'll let you judge for yourself but uh I think it's less important than the actual modeling perspective that we've we've come up with. In order to understand the Transformer we're going to start to thinking about how we can process sequences so text is just sequence of words. possible to be as useful as possible okay so uh these are the the the three different things we want to address right what's good and bad dialogue. We want to be more robust and learn to solve correct and this is where we're going to do reinforcement learning from Human feedback. Open AI does on chtp and this was very very hyped for a long time but now people talk less about it uh okay so what do we do well we have a great model that's been fine tune on dialogue and it's able to generate really good answers. the World by looking at videos right you can even sort to understand how human beings work even better because you can see people being upset or sad or happy whatever right in in a video and start picking these cues up. You can connect the vision part to the text part and get a multimodality model that's able to do both in a really really sophisticated way uh also something that I think these these people are working on all right thank you thank you for your time and good luck with your book. The third lecture on Foundation mulative AI will cover chat GPT. We'll also talk about emerging Foundation models generative AI in the commercial space. And then we'll end with the lecture on AI ethics and regulation as well as a panel. The final lecture on January 16 will be on stable diffusion image generation.

Summary:
A set is convex if for any a and b element of omega, the line between them is in omega, OK? So what does that mean? So let's draw the picture first, and we'll draw the math. Here's the convex set. So it means no matter how I pick a-- here's a-- and no matterhow I pick b, the straight line between. them, the geodesic between them, is in a set. OK? Now, we're going to apply this to functions. Jensen: Q is a probability distribution over the states such that the sum over Q(z) equals 1. Jensen: Q can also be written as an expected value, where z is distributed like Q of this weird-looking quantity. No matter how I pick the probability distribution, this chain of reasoning goes through, Jensen says. The key holds for any Q satisfying star, he says, and that's how we ground it into an example. The result is a curve that's always a lower bound everywhere. be theta t plus 1, OK? And we're going to, again, create some new curve, Lt plus 1 of theta, based on that point. And the key aspects of the point that I'll write in a second is this point is a lower bound. This curve is always below the loss, so it's kind of a surrogate that I'm not overestimating my progress, and it's tight. It meets at exactly that point, so I wouldn't think and get fooled that there was a higher loss function somewhere else. T sigma inverse j x(i) mu j. All right, and so just so you're clear what's going on here, the log turns these multiplications into additions. So we want to set this to 0 and use that sigma j inverse. Sigma j is full rank. And that will become clear in a second why that matters so much, because when we pull it out, what do we get? We get here s Sigma j inverse times sum, which is an unfortunate collision. do this when you have something that sums to 1. It's not more complicated than what I wrote here, but make sure independently you go through it and ask questions. In the next class, as I said, what we're going to see is this notion of factor analysis. And that is going to tell us how to apply EM to a different kind of setting, which, at first glance, will look kind of impossible to do without a latent variable model. And I think that's all I want to say. The EM algorithm is an unsupervised version of k-means GMM. In GMM, you guess randomly an assignment of every point to the cluster, the probability. You guess where they're probabilistically linked, that is, what's the probability of these points belong to cluster one, this point belongs to cluster two. And then once you have that, you then solve some estimation problem that looks like a traditional supervised learning. The decomposition is quite important. And we're going to try and kind of abstract that away.
