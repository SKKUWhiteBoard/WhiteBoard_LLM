Congress has enacted several laws to assist agencies and the federal government in managing IT investments. Most recently, in December 2014, Congress enacted IT acquisition investments. About 8.5 percent of federal agenciesâ€™ planned spending for fiscal year 2016 has gone toward provisioned IT services, leaving the vast majority of spending going toward IT that is non-provisioned. The federal government has spent billions of dollars on failed and poorly performing IT investments which often suffered from ineffective management, project planning, and program oversight.
