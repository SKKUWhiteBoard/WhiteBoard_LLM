AA and I are going to show you how to make vanilla extract so easy so yummy so good for all the things that you would use it for cakes whatever really really good isn't it so let's go [Music] simple now all you want for this is about 1 oz or roughly 30 G of vanilla beans so they'll be you know long Dobby whacker things and just cut them up into I don't know a couple of cenm you may maybe maybe qu an inch half an inch or so Chuck them in now you don't have to worry about scraping out the seeds. leave it the more flavor you'll have want something you can put it in for now you can use a cheesecloth for this or it works really well with one of these. If you've got a coffee machine that'll work excellent now open that and let it strain through. Oh yummmy do you want to try no no I'll see you next time for my next [Music] meal. I hope you like this no no you don't want totry it oh it smells so good do I smell this no youDon't want you to even smell it no you sure no it's really good can I smell it.
