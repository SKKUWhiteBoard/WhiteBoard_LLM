A random variable can take different numerical values depending on the outcome of the experiment. Some of the possible numerical values of a random variable will be more likely than others. We will describe these relative likelihoods in terms of the so-called probability mass function, or PMF. The PMF is also sometimes called the probability law or the probability distribution of a discrete random variable. We use a subscript, X, to indicate which random variable we're talking about. And it has a probability. And in our case this probability is equal to 1/2. the form of the answers. And it's always convenient to also provide a plot with the answers that we have. The answers come in the form of a plot. The plot comes in the shape of a map. The map is a map of the world as seen from the top of a mountain. The top of the mountain is a mountain with a waterfall at the top. The waterfall is a waterfall as well as a river. The river is a river that runs through the middle of the village. The rivers run through the village and the valley.
