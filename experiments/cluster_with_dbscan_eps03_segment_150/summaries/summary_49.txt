the formula for this line is given by y is equal to x plus 1. Conditioned on x, this is the PDF of y. And because it's uniformly distributed and because expectation acts like center of mass, we know that the expectation should be the midpoint, right? And so to compute this point, we simply take the average of the endpoints, x plus1 plus x over 2, which gives us 2x plus 1 over 2. So this is py given x, y given x. And now we can look at this conditional PDF to figure out what this is.  memorizing formulas might seem like cheating, but there's a few important ones you should know. And it will help you sort of become faster at doing computations. And that's important, especially if you guys take the exams. So that's it. See you next time. We'll be back in a few days with a new episode of "The Daily Discussion" to talk about the week's top news stories. Back to the page you came from. Click here for the next episode of The Daily Discussion. Today we're going to do a fun problem that will test your knowledge of the law of total variance. In the process, we'll also get more practice dealing with joint PDFs and computing conditional expectations and conditional variances. So in this problem, we are given a joint PDF for x and y. And then we are asked to compute the variance of x plus y. So you can think of x as a new random variable whose variance we want to compute. And moreover, we're told we should compute this variance by using something called the Law of Total Variance.
