Professor: angular momentum is a set of operators that provide observables, things we can measure. He says they're particularly important for systems in which you have central potentials. Professor: If you have two energy for every system except for every energy except for 0, you have a problem. You know the problem, if you can uniquely characterize the states of the system, then you can learn more about the physics of this state, he says, and you can also know more about physics of a circle. and an electron we can reduce this system to as if we had one particle in a central potential. So that will be also very important physically. And here there is a simple observation that one can make. Is that the differential equation for p l m depends on m squared. We expect to need values of m that are positive and negative. The complex conjugate ones should be thought as having m negative. So we expect positive andnegative m's to be allowed. So how did people figure this out? They, in fact, figured out that if you have these polynomials you can create automatically the solutions for this equation. that don't diverge. So this is very important. It shows that there is one more constraint on your quantum numbers. This formula you may forget, but you should never forget this one. This one says that if you choose some l which corresponds to choosing the magnitude of the angular momentum, l is the eigenvalue. You will have several possibilities for m. There will be several states that have the same l, but m different. So in general when we choose an arbitrary l, then m goes from minus l, minus l plus 1 all the way up to l.
