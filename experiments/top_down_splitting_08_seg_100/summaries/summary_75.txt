Since 2007, the Federal Highway Administration has amended certain national standards for traffic signs. Some state and local agencies complained that the new standards would be relatively costly to comply with. In response to the criticism, FHWA eliminated some of the nighttime visibility maintenance standard compliance deadlines. Nighttime crash rates are estimated to be three times higher than daytime rates, and the fatality rate for nighttime driving is also higher than for daytime driving. At night, when visual cues available to drivers are much more limited, the assistance provided by traffic signs becomes more important.
