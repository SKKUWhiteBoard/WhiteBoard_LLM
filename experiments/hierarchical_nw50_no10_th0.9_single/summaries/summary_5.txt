Since the Bureau of Reclamation's Friant Dam on the San Joaquin River became fully operational in the 1940s, much of the river's water has been diverted for agricultural uses. A coalition of conservation and fishing groups advocating for river restoration sued the Bureau river restoration to support Chinook salmon recovery. Parties agreed to negotiate a settlement instead of proceeding to trial on a remedy regarding the court's ruling. Full implementation of the Settlement would require congressional authorization and appropriations. If Congress does not act on the legislation, some fear that the court will not act.
