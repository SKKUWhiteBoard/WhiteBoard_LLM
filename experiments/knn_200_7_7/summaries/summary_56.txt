In quantum mechanics, the spin of a particle with a vector is quantized. You calculate the length of the spin vector. helicity is defined as the spin dotted with the momentum of the particle. An electron is a left-handed particle, so its helicity will point in this direction. For a fermion, which has a spin 1/2, you get plus 1/ 2 if the spin points in the momentum direction and minus 1/1 if it points in opposite direction. There's no right and wrong in this discussion. If you want to get an eigenvalue with the physical state of particles, which axis are the right ones to choose-- or, sensible? Let me motivate this. The components, and along any axis, actually-- and in this case here, the d-axis-- have eigenvalues. And we find that there is 2s plus 1 possible values. So I'll pick here, just arbitrarily, the z axis. But the question-- it's an obvious question-- which axis is a sensible choice for this problem?
