Coded imaging is a form of a co-design between how you capture the image and how you process the image. In the Fourier domain, convolution in the image domain is multiplication in the standard Fourier transform. If you have a sharp photo and a blurred photo, you can basically represent that as asharp photo. The concept of a position or superposition applies to all three types, shadows- or refraction- or reflection-based techniques. It's a way to recover the sharp detail afterwards in software. digitally. In 1D, the Fourier transform is flat, and almost all of them are the same. Now we're saying, think about the problem in 2D. And what is that function of focus? If we had to know how much is blur, we would have to know the plane of focus. And that's the magic of a broadband code. The bokehs are-- it depends on your-- I mean, for your average consumer, I don't know whether this matters. But you're right. Ramesh Raskar: Compressed sensing is taking a photo and compressing it. He says the idea is to take a single photo and then recover it in a compressed way. Rasksar: If you're on 2 megapixels, then you need to take 2 million [? pics] All right? So the claim this group made at Rice University was that if I wanted a million-pixel image, I don't have to really take a million readings, he says. Rasa: I can take this picture effectively with just 10,000 pixels but recreate a million pixel image. which is how to write a paper and wishlist for photography.
