in this video we're going to discuss what externalities are in economics. An externality is when you do something that affects the well-being or the good of another person or a company but you're neither harmed or rewarded for what you did to that person so the externalities can be positive they can be negative. A negative exTERNality is where you've harmed someone you've done something to somehow impose a cost on someone or some some company or something and you haven't reimbursed that person. your lawn and you mow your lawn and stuff but you don't really spend a l a lot of time making your house look pretty now if your neighbor is trying to sell their house they have a for sale sign up they might appreciate if you went out and really did a great job maintaining your home they would really just love that because then when people come to see their house which is for sale that would increase the value of their home right if the neighboring properties like yours look really really nice then that would help them sell their home.
