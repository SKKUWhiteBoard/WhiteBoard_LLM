Learn how the solar cell device converts sunlight, the input energy, to some usable output energy, which is in the form of electricity, typically, from a solar panel. Learn how to minimize the amount of light reflected or not absorbed into maximizing amount of life that's actually absorbed. Learn about the duality of light, or how to think about light as a particle, or alternatively, as a quantified particle. Use the weekly Newsquiz to test your knowledge of stories you saw on MIT OpenCourseWare. There is a limit to how much we can trap light simply by modifying or corrugating the surfaces to enhance the optical path length. A gentleman by the name of Eli Yablonovitch, who's now a professor in Berkeley calculated these parameters I think back in 1982. He derived an expression for the maximum increase of the opticalPath length due to surface texturing, which was 4n squared. That might not sound like a whole lot, but if you're a $100 billion industry, 1% is a lot of money.
