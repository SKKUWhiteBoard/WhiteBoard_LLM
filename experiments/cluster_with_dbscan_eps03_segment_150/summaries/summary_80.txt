the vessel too much, it's no longer a code stamp vessel. Pretty tricky spot that we're in, huh? But we're trying to science our way out of it. I don't want to keep you longer, but I'll open on Thursday with a little story about how mass attenuation coefficients can get you out of apartheid South Africa. I'm serious. And then we'll move into dose and biological effects. It's a couple minutes after. Well, it was just a few minutes. Michael Short talks about radiation damage and nuclear materials. He explains the different material properties and what they actually mean. Short will be giving a talk at MRS, a materials research conference tomorrow. The talk will be on radiation damage in nuclear materials, which is the biggest research field in MIT's physics department. The course is free and available to the public.
