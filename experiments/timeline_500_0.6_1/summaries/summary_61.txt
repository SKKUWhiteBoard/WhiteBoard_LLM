The size of the ribosome is similar to the size of a rhinovirus. There are many features in this part of the sequence that are very important for translation. Exonucleases might end up chewing up your transcript, but that probably suggests that the messenger RNA has been retired and it's going to retire to a better place. And this, once again, plays other functional roles with respect to being recognized as a transcript and helping to get out of the nucleus of the cell. The structure of a transfer RNA is folded up the way ribonucleic acids are. The 3 prime hydroxyl group of the last ribose within this ribosomal sequence is where the amino acid that's going to be loaded into your protein is attached. One of the loops has a special name. It's called the anticodon loop. It comprises three nucleotides that are complementary to the nucleotide in your messenger sequence. So there is specificity throughout that whole thing, and it's not just bystander stuffing. would be degraded. The missense mutations are the more serious ones because you end up with a full length protein that might have a mistake in it. Am I being clear enough to everyone? Yeah? Good. OK, I am going to tell you that I'm handing over the baton to my colleague, Professor Martin. He'll take over on Monday. And these will be the lectures that will occur. I think this field is fascinating. Once you get used to the mechanics of it, it's really cool to think of how you go from DNA to RNA to folded proteins.
