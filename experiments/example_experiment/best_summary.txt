The morphological unit of life is the cell, whether you're a flea or you're an elephant. We all have the same biological molecules that play a major role inside our bodies, like sugar or fat, or amino acids, or nucleotides. And we all have same major regulatory mechanisms, although as you go from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, things get more complex. And so what we cover in the course is, in fact, most of the things we talk about are bacterial systems because they're better studied. but can be extrapolated between the two systems. That's the major focus of a biochemist. You want to understand things at the molecular level, but then you need to understand what you see inside the cell. You need to go back and forth between inside thecell and understanding the chemical and physical principles by which all the reactions work. It's a back-and-forth process, but it's very important to get the right answer at the end of the day, says the scientist.
