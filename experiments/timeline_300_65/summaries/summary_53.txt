Markus Klute: We're starting a new chapter in which we look at tests and implications of special relativity. One experimental test is stellar aberration, which we discussed can be explained by special relativity and by velocity addition. We can look in particle physics at the decay of a pion into two photons. And those pions, they can have a lot of energy, for example, with a beta of 0.999 times the speed of light. And still the photons are of a very high energy. One of the hypotheses you could have is that the photon actually is a massive particle. This would directly modify Coulomb's laws, which are tested experimentally. Another class of experiment is where we look directly at time dilation, for example, in the decay of the muon. In all of this experimentation and experimental verification, it's important to understand the importance of uncertainties in the scientific process overall, he says. "Remember, when one has the historic perspective on science, one often forgets that a specific measurement comes with an uncertainty," he adds. bias. And he conducted the experiment at the time Einstein was proposing his theory. The bias really came from the model of an electron. And, as experiments, they were inconsistent with Einstein. So he said Einstein is wrong. Einstein and Lorentz are wrong. Planck looked at this and said maybe, but Einstein's conclusion immediately by looking at this was, no, this cannot be. And it took a little bit of time to tee up those experiments until 1940. We now know this was wrong, but scientific process happens in scientific environment.
