For a particle traveling in a circle, we've seen that the velocity can be written as r d theta dt. Let's now look at rotation in an arbitrary plane. And so what we're going to do is use the right hand rule to define a direction that tells you both the direction it defines the plane and it also tells you what the positive direction of rotation is for that plane. Now, in the k hat direction, in this case, I'm going to call it in the arbitrary n hat direction.
