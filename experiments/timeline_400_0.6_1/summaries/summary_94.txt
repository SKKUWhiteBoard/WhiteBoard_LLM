then we are going to continue with the second part of the lecture today which focuses on the problem what actually happens if the gaussian assumption that i have about my constraints doesn't hold. As you will see in some small examples having this outliers in your optimization problem is something which hurts dramatically which actually screw up your solution. Already a few outliers can lead to a environment model which is completely unusable for doing any navigation task so where the geometry of what you computed doesn't fit to the real world geometry anymore and one of the questions actually how to handle that. done you know he said oh damn i can't do that what would be the ugliest trick that you can do in order to make that work even worse no that's not quite what you're going to do i mean the sum is kind of the the the bad thing what can i do with the sum instead of the sum i can i can get rid of thesum in some nice way sorry oh the integral of some to the integral actually makes our life typically worth um so that's that's going what's going to fly. and flatter and flatter gaussian distribution the further the point is actually away there's also one technique which you can find which is also quite easy to implement because you just need to compute the scaling factor and multiply that with your information matrix for every constraint also something you can do quite efficiently. If you have constraint which introduce large errors these are these outliers this can actually screw up the optimization when computing the minimal error configuration. There are different ways of uh kind of row function that we can actually in there and then we're then trying to minimize. here that by changing this function you can't get much better behaviors kind of deciding which function to use for the underlying optimization problem is not on it's not always an easy and easy choice so this requires some expert knowledge some good intuition on coming up with the way with one of those functions. Next week which is the last week of the term i will briefly talk about front ends and give kind of a short summary on what typical front ends exist obviously we're not going to all the details as we did that here.
