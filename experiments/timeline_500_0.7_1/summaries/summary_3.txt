In today's video i'll show you the importance of de-gassing your bread dough as it's fermenting. No matter how gentle you try to handle your dough you will always de-gas it if only a little bit in today's comparison video we'll make 4 breads they will be made from the same dough but they will all be treated differently. The first one of the four breads will be left alone from the beginning of fermentation until it's baked. The final one will be folded shaped and degassed three times and we won't be fermenting them for the same amount of time. dough is left undisturbed it will result in a crumb with large holes surrounded by denser dough that's exactly what we're seeing here on the bread that wasn't de-gassed at all. De-gassing pops those air pockets so the love that got the final shaping has a more even crumb and it rolls higher of course resulting in softer texture. As we keep going the breads become progressively softer and lighter and larger and as i said earlier we're not trying to prove what is better or worse.
