USDA, FDA, EPA, and NMFS are involved in key program functions related to food safety. In fiscal year 2003, the four federal agencies spent nearly $1.7 billion on food safety-related activities. As a result of this division of responsibility, the federal food safety system is fragmented. While the federal agencies regulate the food production chain from farms to food manufacturers, state and local agencies primarily regulate food safety in retail food establishments. The Department of Homeland Security provides overall coordination on how to protect the food supply.
