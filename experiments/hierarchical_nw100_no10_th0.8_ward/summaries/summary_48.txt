The charges for a paper copy made by archive staff ranged from no charge by the Air Force Historical Research Agency, to might be significantly understated. All of the four primary archives charge fees for providing historical information to requesters. None of the fees were in accordance with the mandated DOD user fee schedule. These arrangements, by reducing budgetary pressures, have lessened the benefits that an archive could achieve from implementing Section 1085. Such arrangements, the costs of reproducing photographs and responding to requester would come from the archive’s budget, and the fees collected from the customer would be deposited in Treasury's Miscellaneous Receipts and would not be available to offset the costs. $3.50 minimum specified in the DOD’s User Charge fee schedule. The Marine Corps fees, which are based on FOIA, resulted in any requester receiving up to 2 hours of search time and 100 pages without a charge. Archives officials said that fees are often waived for military personnel, veterans, government employees, and others. Archive officials state that search fees are not usually charged, which can be a significant element of cost that should be recovered. Military archive officials reported collecting about $81,000 during fiscal year 2000. The Army Military History Institute arranged for a contract, through a nonappropriated fund account, to reproduce requested photographs with fees collected for the photographs reimbursing the fund. The Naval Historical Center refers those requesting its photographs to the Naval Historical Foundation, a nonprofit foundation, which reproduces the photographs and charges the customer.

In the mid-1990s, the Army Military History Institute began developing proposed legislation for charging and retaining fees to defray costs of providing historical information to the public. The Institute, whose mission is to preserve the Army’s history, was experiencing a significant increase in requests from the public while resources available to respond were decreasing. For example, the annual number of requests increased from about 13,000 in 1987 to 20,600 in 1995 and to 35,800 in 2000. During the same period, the number of staff members decreased from over 40 to over 30. period, the number of staff members decreased from over 40 to 33. The Institute developed and submitted legislative proposals that authorized it to charge and retain fees. Congress enacted Section 1085 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. The four designated archives are the Air Force Historical Research Agency at Maxwell AFB, Alabama; Army Military History Institute at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania; Marine Corps Historical Center at Washington atCarlisle Barrack, Pennsylvania and Naval Historical center at Washington Navy Yard, D.C. Section 1085 does not apply to the DOD offices, organizations, museums, and archives other than the four designated archives. The User Charge Statute and FOIA will continue to be the basic authority for these activities to charge fees for providing information.

Fees collected under both the User Charge and FOIA for general information must be deposited in the Treasury as Miscellaneous Receipts. Research Agency had tasked key stakeholders with determining a fee structure. However, they have not established a target date for implementing the Section. Section 1085 permits each of the four archives to develop its own fee schedule provided that the fees charged do not exceed the costs of providing the information. Officials at the Naval Historical Center and the Marine Corps Historical Center have not decided whether to implement a fee system. They have taken no specific actions toward implementation and have received no implementation guidance from their headquarters. One of the factors affecting Section. Fees for search, review, and duplication of documents are to be based on direct costs. Fees will be waived or reduced when the information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of DOD, and fees shall be automatically waived when assessable fees total $15 or less. As with User Charges, DOD fee schedules for charges under FOIA are not current. If FOIA fees are understated by a significant amount, as appears possible, increases in collections from updated FOIA fee schedules could be significant. use of outdated fees schedules, the archives and other providers of public information throughout DOD have not collected a million dollars or more annually in user fees and have treated public requesters inconsistently.

The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 and OMB Circular A-25 require a biennial review of charges for services. Fees being developed by the Army Military History Institute indicate that the fees mandated in Appendix 2 might be significantly understated. DOD policy is that when a service is provided that conveys special benefits to recipients, above and beyond those accruing to the public at large, a reasonable charge shall be made to each identifiable recipient. The policy provides that a charge will be imposed to recover the full cost to the federal government of rendering a service or the fair market value of such service, whichever is higher. Appendix 1 of Chapter 4 lists benefits for which no charge has been imposed so far. The cost of this article has been updated to reflect the new policy.
