CPDF data show that of the 132,287 reductions in on-board personnel that took place during this time period, 48 percent involved buyouts and 6 percent came from RIFs. The remaining 46 percent involved separations without buyouts or the basis for separation was not identified in the CPDF. Because of the rights of higher graded employees to “bump” or “retreat” to lower-graded positions during a RIF, employees separated through Rifs are frequently not those who were in the positions originally targeted for elimination. Over a 5-year period, buyouts would generally result in more savings to taxpayers than RIFs. This is because buyouts usually result in the separation of employees with higher salaries and benefits. However, these results would change if bumping and retreating did not occur in a RIF and the separated employees were eligible for retirement. In these cases, Rifs could generate up to 12 percent more in savings over the 5 year period than buyouts. Finally, if the employees were separated without bumped and retreating and were not retirement-eligible, the cost of severance pay for the RIFed employees would result in buyouts generating up to 10 percent more. such situations, buyouts or RIFs may be necessary. In comparing the costs and savings of buyouts and Rifs, our analysis showed that buyouts offered greater savings than RIF's, except when RIFed employees do not bump and retreat and are eligible to retire. This concludes my prepared statement. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have about the use of RIF or buyouts in the U.S. government. If you have a question for me, please email me at jennifer.smith@dailymail.co.uk. Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-226) placed annual ceilings on executive branch full-time equivalent (FTE) positions. If implemented as intended, these ceilings will result in downsizing the federal workforce. By the end of fiscal year 1997, the administration’s budget calls for nearly 53,000 FTE positions below the ceiling called for by the act for that period. Although the workforce reductions occurred governmentwide, they were not evenly distributed among agencies.. Most of the reductions could be met in total through an attrition rate as low as 1.5 percent and still allow for some limited hiring. Total governmentwide FTE levels to date are well below the annual ceilings mandated by the Workforce Restructuring Act. With regard to future workforce reductions, our analysis showed that in terms of absolute numbers, the remaining annual FTE employment ceilings probably could be achieved governmentwide through attrition. Nevertheless, some agencies may be required to downsize more than others. In. the last fiscal year, the percentage of minorities went from 27.9 percent to 28.9percent of the workforce. Our estimates indicate that the act’s final fiscal year 1999 target for FTE ceilings could could be reached. that the average annual quit rate was about 8 percent. Federal employment levels (FY 1996 - 1997 are budgetary estimates). GAO estimates. Federal Workforce Restructuring Act ceiling. Government agencies may need to pare down their workforces more than others as budgets are reduced, programs are dropped, and other factors are taken into account. Some agencies may have to cut back on the number of people they have working for them as a result of budget cuts. The U.S. federal government has a workforce of about 1.2 million people. The act allowed non-Department of Defense (DOD) executive branch agencies to pay buyouts to employees who agreed to resign, retire, or take voluntary early retirement by March 31, 1995, unless extended by the head of the agency. The act was signed into law on January 1, 1995. The buyouts were supposed to be paid out by the end of 1999, but were paid out after March 31. The bill was passed by Congress on January 2, 1995 and signed by President Clinton on January 3, 1995; the buyouts began on March 31 of that year. DOD, though subject to the act’s governmentwide FTE ceilings, has the authority, under earlier legislation, to offer buyouts through September 30, 1999. For both DOD and non-DOD agencies, the buyout payment was the lesser of $25,000 or an employee's severance pay entitlement. According to OPM data, as of September. 30, 1997, the average buyout amount was $24,000. For DOD andnon-Dod agencies, it was $23,000, according to the OPM. the downsizing took place at DOD. As shown in table 2, DOD absorbed nearly three-quarters of the FTE reductions in fiscal year 1994. In fiscal year 1997, DOD is expected to absorb all of theFTE reductions made that fiscal year. DOD absorbed over half of the governmentwide reductions in Fiscal Year 1995. In Fiscal Year 1996, DOD will absorb over half the Governmentwide reductions. DOD will also absorb nearly all the Government-wide reductions made in fiscal Year 1997, including those made in Fiscal year 1996. year to year because of such factors as the state of the economy, the availability of separation incentives, and employees’ personal considerations, federal attrition has typically run considerably higher than 1.5 percent. For example, in fiscal years 1982 through 1992 (the year before buyouts began at DOD), CPDF data shows that federal attrition was 1.7 percent. In fiscal years 2013 through 2014, attrition has been 1.8 percent, according to CPDF. The average federal attrition rate is 1.9 percent. The federal workforce is being reduced at a faster pace than was called for by the Workforce Restructuring Act. DOD was responsible for about 71 percent of these buyouts. From September 30, 1994, through March 1995, the on-board executive branch civilian workforce dropped from 2,164,727 employees to 2,032,440 employees, a reduction of 6. If not for the buyout authority, it is likely that more agencies would have RIFed a larger number of employees. remaining categories showed no proportional reduction or slight increases. Some employees delayed their separations so that they could receive a buyout. Although it was not an explicit goal of the buyout legislation, the buyouts appeared to have helped agencies downsize without adversely affecting workforce diversity. Indeed, of the nearly 83,000 employees affected by the law, only about 1 in 5 were in the lowest-paid or least-experienced category. The buyouts were intended to help agencies reduce their workforce. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: We are pleased to be here today to discuss the progress being made in downsizing the federal workforce. As agreed with your office, our statement includes information on the results to date of federal downsizing efforts, whether agencies’ use of buyouts. Mr. Chairman, we are happy to provide you with the information you need to make an informed decision about the future of the federal government. We look forward to hearing from you in the coming days. Budget Office, and other federal agencies; contacts with agency officials; and demographic data from the CPDF. A more detailed analysis of the circumstances under which buyouts or RIFs offer greater potential savings is contained in the report we prepared for this Subcommittee that was released today. The Federal Workforce Restructuring report was released by the Subcommittee on Budget and Management on Wednesday. The report was prepared by the subcommittee's staff and was published by the Congressional Budget Office on Thursday. The full report is available on the Subcommittee's website. use of buyouts reflected the administration’s workforce restructuring goals as articulated by the National Performance Review. The demographic results of the buyouts were based on CPDF workforce data. The cost and Savings Implications of Buyouts versus 1997 federal budget were compared. The study was based on applicable Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance to agencies and CPDF data. It also looked at the extent to which we estimate that the statutorily mandated workforce reduction goals could be met through attrition. administration called on agencies to increase managers’ and supervisors’ span of control over other employees from a ratio of 1:7 to 1:15, and to cut management control positions by half. In our draft report on agencies’ use of buyouts that we are preparing for this Subcommittee, we present preliminary data on buyouts at the federal government and state and local levels. We are preparing a draft report for the Subcommittee on Government Purchasing that we will present to the full subcommittee. employees who were paid buyouts from fiscal year 1993 through March 31, 1995, 52 percent were white males. Consequently, the percentage of women in the workforce increased from 43.4 percent at the end of fiscal year 1992 to 44.6 percent by March 1, 1995. Likewise, during that same time period, during the same period of time, the number of women working in the U.S. was at a record high of 44.5 percent. The percentage of men in the workplace was at an all-time low of 17.7 percent. percentage of supervisors at DOD agencies dipped from 12.7 percent of the workforce to 11.9 percent. All but one of the other designated management control positions increased somewhat. Acquisition positions showed no change. Non-DOD agencies came only slightly closer to meeting the NPR goals. The percentage of supervisors in the non-Dod workforce went from 12,5 percent to 11,6 percent. Personnel and headquarters staff also decreased as a proportion of the non.DOD workforce. The NPR goals were to increase the number of supervisors to 12,000 by 2015. through NPR, recommended that agencies direct their workforce reductions at specific “management control” positions that the administration said added little value to serving taxpayers. Such positions included those held by (1) managers and supervisors and (2) employees in headquarters, personnel, budget, procurement, and accounting occupations. By fiscal year 1999, the showing that, as a proportion of the workforce as a whole, the management control positions designated for reduction by NPR were barely reduced since the end of fiscal year 1992. on the assumption that positions vacated by separating employees would not be refilled by government or contractor personnel. Projected savings would be reduced if this occurred. Their workforces by reducing management control positions. These positions have not been reduced as a proportion of the workforce as called for by NPR. They have been left in place as a result of the government's decision not to reduce the size of their workforce as originally planned. They are not expected to be reduced as part of a larger plan to reduce government and private sector jobs. and/or missions are changed. In such circumstances, some agencies may not be able to meet workforce reduction goals through attrition, and other downsizing strategies, such as buyouts or RIFs, may be necessary. If it were to reduce at this pace, NASA has said that it would anticipate that Rifs would be needed. Although this downsizing proposal may or may not. be implemented, it illustrates the potential magnitude of workforce reductions being considered at some individual agencies. do so 3 years earlier. reductions-in-force (RIF) We obtained information on the results of federal downsizing activities by analyzing workforce data contained in the Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) Central Personnel Data File (CPDF) for fiscal year 1992 through November of fiscal year 1996. The costs and savings of buyouts and RIFs were analyzed using past studies by us, the Congressional year while the non-DOD workforce is expected to increase by a net total of 0.2 percent. Our estimate of the extent to which mandated workforce reduction goals can be achieved by attrition was based on workforce trends data in the President's fiscal year 1997 federal budget.
