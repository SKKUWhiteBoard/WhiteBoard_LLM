Obesity rates have risen substantially in recent decades, from 13% of the adult population in the 1960s to 36% in 2009-2010. The number of overall calories consumed has increased from a daily average of 1,875 calories during 1977-1978 to 2,067 calories during 2005-2008. Increasingly, these calories are consumed outside the home. Calorie labeling on menus has been adopted as one approach to making consumers aware of the amount of calories they are consuming. This report provides a discussion of the role of nutrition labeling in combating obesity, an overview of the FDA's authority to regulate nutrition labeling, and the proposed rule implementing this provision.
