James Swan: We're still going to talk about transformations of matrices. We looked at one type of transformation we could utilize for solving systems of equations. Today, we'll look at another one, the eigenvalue decomposition. On Monday, we will look at a different type of decomposition called the singular value decomposition, he says. James Swan: There were a lot of good questions that came up during class. We want to make sure that we're answering those questions in a timely fashion.
