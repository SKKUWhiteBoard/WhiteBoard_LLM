picks its larger and smaller cards randomly, it's going to be another example of a number produced by a random process. And likewise, the number of the smaller card. So that's enough examples. This little game has a whole bunch of random variables appearing in it. And in the next segment, we will look again officially, what is the definition of a random variable? We will also look again at the concept of "randomness" in the game of cards and dice. Albert Meyer: Random variables are an absolutely fundamental concept in probability theory. He says in a game called the bigger number game, two teams try to pick the larger number. Meyerer: Team 2 picks one of the pieces of paper and turns it over and looks at the number on it. And then, based on what that number is, they make a decision, stick with the number they have or switch to the other unknown number on the face down piece of paper, he says.
