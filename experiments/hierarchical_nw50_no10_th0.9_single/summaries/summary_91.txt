Prepositioned equipment and supplies are strategic assets, along with sealift and airlift, for projecting military power. Military equipment and infrastructure are often located in corrosive environments that increase the deterioration of assets and shorten their useful life. Higher rates of corrosion result in increased repairs and replacements, drive up costs, and take critical systems out of action, reducing mission readiness. The Army could increase its use of storage facilities for land-based assets. Temporary shelters may be a feasible option to address storage needs.
