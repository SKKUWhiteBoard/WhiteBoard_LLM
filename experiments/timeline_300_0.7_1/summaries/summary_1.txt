John ESSIGMANN: I measure my blood sugar at different times during the day. Gluconeogenesis technically means new synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors. The medicine I take is called Metformin. It has a number of targets, but one of them is one of the enzymes, called PEPCK, Pyruvate Carboxykinase, that's in the gluconeogenic pathway. It's pretty reasonable by the time I go to bed, but then at night, when I stop moving around a lot, this gluconeogenesis process continues. body, the brain, our red blood cells, that require glucose. They can't work with anything else. So gluconeogenesis, by principally the liver, provides a constant stream of glucose to these organs that absolutely require it, like our brain. What I do, during the night, is to take this drug that will prevent the switch to produce more and more sugar by gluc oneogenesis. And I do it to keep my blood glucose level at about 100 while we're not eating.
