to prepare an environmental impact statement pursuant to the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as implemented by the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations. Examine the potential plan for Guam. Under NEPA and the regulations for implementing NEPA, an impact statement must include a purpose and need statement, a description of all reasonable project alternatives and their associated environmental impacts (including a “no action” alternative), and a description. of the potential project plan. The notice of intent in the Federal Register states that the impact statement will: environment of the area to be affected or created by the alternatives being considered, and an analysis of the environmental impacts of the proposed action and each alternative. Further, accurate scientific analysis, expert agency comments, and public scrutiny are essential to implementing NEPA. For example, federal agencies such as DOD such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are required to report on their activities to the Department of Energy (DOD) on a regular basis. NIST's website is www.nist.org. are required to ensure the professional integrity, including scientific integrity, of the discussions and analyses in the environmental impact statement. Federal agencies such as DOD are required to obtain the comments of any federal agency that has jurisdiction by law or certain. DOD is also required to prepare a draft Environmental Impact Statement for the project. The project is expected to be completed by the end of the year, according to the White House. The cost of the project is estimated to be $1 billion to $2 billion. special expertise and request the comments of appropriate state and local agencies, Native American tribes, and any agency that has requested that it receive such statements. Until an agency issues a final environmental impact statement and record of decision, it generally may not take any action concerning the proposal that is being considered by the agency. The agency may not act on a proposal until it has received the final impact statement. The proposal is expected to be approved by the end of the year. For more information on the proposal, go to: http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/28/science/environment/science-and-biological-science/stories/story/story-news/stories-news-story-story/genealogy-gene-graphic-trends-talks-tweet-took-gneepers-to-says-tribal-tribes-targets. impact statement. The results of the environmental statement will affect many of the key decisions on the exact location, size, and makeup of the military infrastructure development. On March 7, 2007, the Navy issued a public notice of intent. The environmental statement could take up to 3 years to complete and is expected to cost $1 billion to $2 billion. The Navy has not said how much it will spend on the project. The project is currently under review by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Defense. improving the plans, though they do not address the issue of residual value as we recommended in 2004. As we reported last year, residual value was excluded from OSD’s guidance because it is based on the reuse of be assumed in the master plans. We continue to believe that OSD should require commands, at a minimum, to explain the issues with obtaining residual value in each host nation and in each country that uses the plans. However, since these issues vary by host nation, it may not be clear to all users of the plan. All of the regional commands describe to varying degrees the status of recent negotiations and agreements with host nations in their fiscal year 2008 master plans. In our review of the overseas master plans in 2005, we found that none of the commands fully explained the status. of or implementation of the plans. We are happy to clarify this information for the benefit of the American public in the U.S. and our allies in Europe and the Middle East.

These agreements depend largely on the political environment and economic conditions in host nations and can affect the extent of host nation support—access to the U.S. military. The commands recommend the commands briefly explain the Status of Negotiations with Host Nations to provide a better understanding of what is being discussed and how it will be implemented.

It is also based in the United States, where it is based on a joint base. more comprehensive description of the challenges DOD faces in implementing the plans than in previous years. But while this year’s plans provide information to respond to most of our prior recommendations, they do not address residual value. The value of property being turned over to the host nation is limited for most categories of military facilities and is often reduced by actual or anticipated environmental remediation costs. Consequently, as we have noted in the past, DOD officials believe that residual value cannot be readily predicted and therefore should not be predicted. In 2004, before DOD issued its initial overseas master plans, we reported that various factors, such as residual property value, environmental remediation, and the availability of multiple U.S. funding sources, could affect the funding of U.s. infrastructure overseas. Once the plans are issued, the implementation of the plans once they are issued will depend on how well they are implemented, we said. We reported that the plans could be delayed by as much as five years if not more than a decade. in next year’s plans. The fiscal year 2008 master plans discussed a number of challenges that DOD faces in the implementation of the plans. These challenges include uncertainties with host nation relations and environmental concerns. In our prior reports, we explained how these challenges could have an effect on infrastructure and the military’S ability to respond to the needs of the nation in the event of a war in the Middle East or in the Asia-Pacific region of the world. We are happy to clarify these issues for you. funding levels and sources, environmental remediation and restoration issues, property returns to host nations, and training requirements. We also analyzed available reports, documents, policies, directives, international agreements, guidance, and media articles to keep abreast of ongoing changes in overseas defense basing strategies and requirements.

PACOM must also explain how it plans to address existing training limitations that may affect infrastructure and funding requirements. We believe that identifying these issues would provide Congress an awareness of potential challenges of recouping needed to address their concerns. Our recommendation to Congress is grounded in the fact that residual value issues vary by host nation and the implications for U,S. funding also vary accordingly and thus may not be clear. The U.S. government has received approximately $592 million since 1989 in residual value and payment-in-kind compensation from property returns in EUCOM’s area of responsibility. EUCOM continues to aggressively seek compensation for U.s. capital improvements at installations returned to host nations. Report: Report: The implications of EUCOM's decision for the United States could have a significant impact on funding for the military.report the implications of the EUCOM decision on the U.N.'s funding requirements. Congress should consider requiring the Secretary of Defense to ensure that future overseas master plans address the extent to which the regional commands are seeking residual value compensation for U.S. capital necessary. DOD already provides status reports on its residual value negotiations to the Committees on Appropriations, the deputy under secretary of defense says. But Congress should also require annual review and oversight by Congress and other users of the Overseas Master Plans, he says. The bill is now up for consideration by the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. and Armed Services and that prior legislation outlines reporting requirements on the closure of foreign military installations worldwide. While we were aware of these reporting requirements, these reports do not provide users of the master plans the kind of information that they need. We are aware that there are specific reporting requirements throughout the residual value negotiation process, but these reports don't provide the information that is needed for the master plan to be effective. We apologise for any confusion caused by the lack of information in these reports. We will continue to work with the military to ensure that the plans are effective. recommended that overseas regional commands address residual value issues and that PACOM explain how it plans to address existing training limitations in our prior reports. We believe that identifying these issues would make Congress aware of potential challenges to obtaining residual value and to training U.S. forces in South Korea. We continue to believe that these recommendations have merit and that Congress would benefit from disclosure of this information. In July 2006, the Senate report accompanying the fiscal stimulus package said that residual value from host nations could affect facility requirements and funding. inconsistency led to our recommendation that Congress require such reporting. We continue to believe that this information is necessary to provide a complete picture of the potential effects on infrastructure and funding requirements in South Korea. In commenting on our matter for congressional consideration that the Secretary of Defense that the Pentagon report to Congress, we ask that the secretary of defense provide us with a copy of the report. We are happy to receive such a report from the Pentagon, which we believe would provide a more accurate picture of what is going on in Korea. In the 2008 master plans, OSD recognized that further changes will result as it continues to implement the global defense posture decisions. The department reported that as the overseas political and military environment and strategic landscape further evolve, global defense as changes occurred and decisions were made. The evolution of U.S. overseas defense basing strategies and requirements continues, according to the 2008 plans. The changes occurring after this year’s plans were submitted to Congress will have to be reflected in the future. The 2008 plans were released to the public on October 1. in the U.S. overseas defense basing strategies and requirements. The plans continue to improve each year by providing more complete, clear, and consistent information and descriptions of the challenges DOD faces overseas. However, we have previously recommended that overseas regional commands address the extent to which they should be involved in basing decisions in the United States. We have previously also recommended that the Department of Defense provide more information about the challenges it faces in overseas basing. We are happy to provide that information to the public. year, DOD forecasted changes for next year’s master plans. New command responsible for Africa expected to be established by September 30, 2008.

We compared the reporting requirements in the congressional mandate and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) guidance, which incorporated our prior recommendations. In order to identify improvements to the overseas master plan, we compared and contrasted the fiscal year 2007 and 2008 plans. We assessed the quantity and quality of information provided by the Defense Department. We also assessed the extent to which the plans address the challenges faced by the Department of Defense during implementation.members who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix III. The fiscal year 2008 overseas master plans have been updated to reflect our prior recommendations for environmental activities. The plans provide the users of the plans with the ability to compare and comprehend how costs have varied and how these costs may affect planned U.S. funding levels.

The master plans also described recent efforts to proceed with formal negotiations with the governments of Poland and the Czech Republic on establishing missile defense sites. This includes listing the returns of facilities, changes to its basing categories, and the rationale for these realignments. This list of facilities and changes is based on the U.S. military's master plans for the area of responsibility. It also includes a list of the changes that have been made to the basing category. future requirements. In 2006, we reported that the master plans did not always explain how their implementation could be affected by other relevant and related defense plans and activities. We also reported that while the plans addressed a number of challenges that DOD faced, they did not explain how they would affect other activities. Without such explanations and linkage, it was difficult to determine the extent to which the master plan was coordinated and synchronized with other defense plans, we said at the time. We said it was also difficult to see the effects these other activities had on infrastructure and funding requirements. requirements, associated costs, and a timeline for specific actions and was not intended to meet the requirement to provide a master plan to both congressional appropriations committees by December 2006. In addition, the development plan does not direct individual service programming actions or provide for specific funding requirements.

The plan is intended to be used for the development of a national infrastructure plan for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. succeeding year to reflect changes to the plans involving specific construction projects being added, canceled, or modified. The Senate report also directed GAO to monitor the comprehensive master plans being developed and implemented for the state. GAO will also look at funding for those projects being redirected to other needs, and justification for such changes, the report said. The report also said GAO should monitor the master plans' development and implementation for the next five years, and report back to the Senate in two years. effort and to develop a master plan. At the time of our review, JGPO and the Department of the Interior had formed a federal interagency task force in order to coordinate efforts to address issues relating to commerce, transportation, environment, and other areas. J GPO falls under the direct oversight of the Department Of the Interior, which had formed the task force at the time. The task force is now under the oversight of a different federal agency, the National Transportation Safety Board, which has formed a task force of its own. The Senate Appropriations Committee has expressed concern about the use of military construction budget authority for projects at bases. The committee has also expressed concern that the projects may soon be obsolete because of changes being considered in overseas presence and basing. The plans should identify funding requirements and the division of funding responsibilities between the United States and cognizant host nations, the committee said. The Senate report also directed DOD to provide congressional defense committees a report on the status and implementation of those plans with each yearly militaryConstruction budget submission through fiscal year 2015. Military construction appropriations fund the planning, design, construction, alteration, and improvement of military facilities worldwide. The military construction appropriation request for fiscal year 2008 included approximately $21.3 billion for military construction and family housing. Nearly $1.2 billion (5.6 percent) is designated for specific overseas locations, mostly comprising enduring enduring military facilities in Europe and the Middle East. The U.S. military construction budget for 2008 is $20.7 billion, up from $19.9 billion in 2007. The House conference report accompanying the 2004 military construction appropriation bill also directed the department to prepare comprehensive master plans with yearly updates through fiscal year 2009. The first report was due with the fiscal year 2005 military construction budget submission and is to be updated each.year 2008. The report was released in time for the start of the new fiscal year on October 1, 2005.

Even though our prior recommendations have not been fully addressed, we continue to believe that they have merit and that Congress would benefit from disclosure of this information. DOD’s planning effort for the buildup of military forces and infrastructure on and up-to-date information would be useful for funding decisions and assessments of all available options to assist DOD, federal departments and agencies, the Government of Guam, and other organizations in addressing the challenges associated with the military buildup. In 2005, we reported that without more complete, clear, and consistent reporting of various items, Congress lacked the complete picture it needed to evaluate the annual military construction funding request. This year, the plans provided a much more comprehensive description of challenges and the potential effects on the U.S. military. We are happy to make clear that the plans were updated for this year’s funding request, as well as for previous years’ requests for military construction funds.

It was published in conjunction with the Hawaii Institute for Policy Studies. and oversight. Congress did not have the best available and consistent data on which to track progress and changes from year to year and between commands. Also, we reported that without the detailed information on individual construction projects and the anticipated strategic end state of the command’s overseas basing infrastructure, Congress didn’t know what was going on in the military. We also reported that Congress didn't know what the U.S. was doing in the Middle East at the time of the 9/11 attacks.

We met with officials from OSD and each of the following commands and agencies: U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM); U. s. Army Pacific; Commander, U.s. Pacific Fleet. We also discussed the Integrated Military Development Plan with PACOM and JGPO officials. We discussed the various factors that can affect the various forces that are part of the force and how they can work together to achieve a common goal. In August 2006, OSD directed the Navy to establish JGPO to facilitate, manage, and execute requirements associated with the rebasing of Marine Corps assets from Okinawa to Guam. The office’s responsibilities include integration of operational support requirements, development, program, and budget synchronization; oversight of the construction; and coordination of government and business activities. The U.S. Marine Corps is based in Okinawa, Japan, but is moving its assets to Guam to be closer to the United States.  PACOM described the importance of relocating 8,000 marines and their dependents from Okinawa to Guam, returning additional land to Japan, and retaining a forward Marine Corps command and control capability. Final implementation documents were approved in May 2006, according to PACOM. The U.S. military says the move will allow for a "balanced, flexible" military presence on the island. The move is expected to be complete by the end of the year, PACOM says. For more information, visit PACOM's official website. phases with many key decisions and challenges yet to be addressed. In July 2006, PACOM issued its Guam development plan—a notional document describing the future development of the military services on Guam over the next decade and beyond. The plan is based upon a notional force structure that was used to develop the Guam force structure in the 1990s and early 2000s. For more information, visit the PACOM Guam website or go to: www.pacomguam.org/guam-development-plan.  PACOM’s master plan updated information on the results of the Defense Policy Review Initiative. CENTCOM explained that its efforts to attain host nation funding were ongoing. This year, all of the commands described the effects of other defense activities on implementation of their master plans. The resulting agreements may increase or decrease U.S.-funded costs for future infrastructure changes.to facilities or funding—to U.s. forces. For example, PACOM's force structure plans are linked to the military buildup on Guam. enough to all users of the plans. We continue to believe that the Secretary of Defense should require commands to explain the issues with obtaining residual value from each host nation and report the implications for U.S. funding. In commenting on our matter for congressional consideration that future PACOM plans should be made clear to the public, we ask that the secretary of defense make it clear that the plans are for the benefit of the United States, not the use of any other nation. We believe that this is the right thing to do. detailed, comprehensive master plans. PACOM coordinates East Asia and South Asia; EUCOM coordinates much of sub- Saharan Africa and Europe. posture plans will continue to mature to address new priorities. DOD’s efforts to establish missile defense in Eastern Europe, and the creation of U.S. Africa Command, are among the changes identified in the overseas master plans for PACOM and EUCOM. For more information on PACOM, visit the PACOM website or the EUCOM website. As EUCOM continues to return facilities in Germany, Italy, and Iceland, this figure may increase. We continue to believe that residual value should be addressed in the master plans. PACOM’s master plan provided details on other challenges, but it did not describe the challenges the command faces in Germany and Italy. It also did not provide details on the challenges in Iceland and the UK. It did not detail the challenges it faces in the UK and the Netherlands. It was not clear what the challenges were in these countries. cooperation, extend humanitarian assistance, and build partnership capacity on the African continent. At the time of our review, U.S. involvement in Africa is shared among three combatant commands. PACOM is responsible for Madagascar, the Seychelles, and the Indian Ocean area off the African coast. EUCOM isresponsible for the largest part of the African region, which is home to more than 100 million people. The African Union has called on the United States to increase its military presence in the continent.  PACOM’s master plan does not describe the challenges the Air Force faces in training in South Korea. It does describe for the first time the challenges addressing training limitations in Japan. These limitations could cause the U.S. to pursue alternatives, such as training in other locations, downsizing, or relocating, which could affect overseas basing plans. On its reuse of property, PACOM found that the PACOM master plan was more restrictive than other plans on reuse of land. faced in implementation, such as uncertainties with host nation relations and environmental concerns. PACOM’s plan did not address training limitations in South Korea and Japan. We explained how some of these challenges could have a significant effect on infrastructure and funding requirements. To help ensure the best application of limited federal funds and the leveraging of all available options, PACOM plans must address existing training limitations and the potential effects of those limitations in its area of responsibility, we said. We also said that future plans should address the potential effect of those training limitations on infrastructure, funding requirements and infrastructure improvements. the progress of dynamic realignment initiatives, which will relocate military personnel and facilities in South Korea and Japan. For example, last year PACOM reported that the U.S. and Japanese governments had established an interim agreement in October 2005 involving the realignment of American forces in Japan. This year, PACOM updated this year on the progress of Dynamic Realignment Initiatives in Japan and South Korea, including the relocation of American military personnel, facilities and personnel to the two countries. For more information, visit PACOM's website. Potential Government of Japan financial constraints may result in U.S. facilities in Japan requiring more financial support. In addition, USFK provided details on current realignment efforts, including the Government of South Korea’s approval of the Land Partnership Plan and Yongsan Relocation Plan.

PACOM provided information updating the status of the Land Partnership Plan and the Yongsan Relocation Plan. PACOM identified host nation funding for its bilateral agreements in South Korea. On the U.S. military camps and sites returned to the Government of South Korea, PACOM described the results from the fiscal years 2009 through 2013, which provided users a better basis to determine the extent to which U.s. funding is needed for facility requirements. The report also provided information on U.N.contingency response capacity within the Asia-Pacific region. challenges in this year’s overseas master plans. In 2005, none of the commands identified environmental remediation and restoration issues. This year, PACOM provided information on remediation actions taken by USFK before returning installations to South Korea. Such as skimming fuel, such as in the case of U.S. Navy installations in South Korea, the U.N. military said in a report this week. The report also said that in the past, USFK has been found to be guilty of environmental violations in the South Korean military. components were not appropriate for inclusion and would not be addressed in the overseas commands’ risk assessment for their master plans. While we are not aware of any nonprogrammed and nonvalidated training limitations, our report discusses only those training limitations raised by senior command officials during our review. In response to this guidance U.S. Forces Japan provided information on training limitations. USFK omitted this information from the overseas master plan. We assume combatant commands to identify and discuss risks to their master Plans. address training limitations in its area of responsibility. Deputy Under Secretary of Defense responded that validated training requirements that are affected by force posture transformation plans should be addressed in overseas master plans. He further stated that nonprogrammed and nonvalidated training limitations experienced by service are to be addressed by the military's overseas master plan. He said the department agrees that validation of training requirements is a key part of the training process for the military and that it should be included in the overseas masterplan. For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or see www.samaritans.org for details. that if there is a need to make a distinction between nonvalidated versus validated training limitations, OSD and the overseas commands would work together to identify those validated limitations that should be addressed in their master plans. In addition, last year OSD included in its guidance a requirement for the training to be validated before it can be used in the military. The requirement is part of the U.S. Department of Defense’s “Stand By Your Training” program. The program is designed to help the military train and prepare its personnel for use in the field. of South Korea to train at other ranges, according to senior Air Force and USFK officials. Other ranges do not provide electronic scoring capabilities necessary to meet Air Force’s air-to-surface training requirements. As a result, the Air Force has been using ranges in Japan and Alaska to meet its training requirements, which results in additional transportation costs to the U.S. government. In May 2007, officials said that some progress had been made in addressing the Air Air Force's training challenges in South Korea. The Seventh Air Force in South Korea may be unable to maintain combat capability in the long term because of a lack of adequate air-to-surface ranges. For decades, the Government of South Korea has attempted to relocate the Eighth Air Force to a new base in the U.S. South.S Korea has been at the center of a diplomatic dispute with the United States over the use of U.N. forces in the Korean peninsula since the Korean War of 1950-53. The United States and South Korea have been at odds for decades over who should control South Korea. The Koon-Ni range was the primary air-to-ground range for the Seventh Air Force. It was closed in August 2005. The air and ground range management was transferred to the Government of South Korea, which closed the range in 2005. There is an agreement with the Government that the range will be used for military training in the future, but only if it is approved by the South Korean government. The range is currently being used to train pilots for the U.S. Air Force and other military forces. EUCOM’s master plan identified specific information on efforts to close or return from groundwater at five camps. Last year, USFK also discussed its efforts to coordinate with the Government of South Korea on remediation of vacated U.S. bases. Officials expect these efforts will accelerate the return of vacated facilities and areas to South Korea and the relocation of U.s. personnel and equipment. The plans also discussed USFK's efforts to work with South Korea to complete the transition of wartime operational control from the United States. announced what has been described as the most comprehensive restructuring of U.S. military forces overseas since the end of the Korean War. The initiative is intended to close bases no longer needed to meet Cold War threats, as well as bring home many U.s. forces while stationing more flexible, deployable forces. The U.N. Security Council is expected to vote on the initiative in the coming weeks. The United States has been involved in the war in Afghanistan since the early 1990s. in the implementation of base realignment and closure recommendations would cause them to delay the movement of Army servicemembers and their families. This would delay the closings of Army installations in Europe and increase costs to operate those. If facilities were not available at receiving installations in the U.S., the Army would have to send troops to other locations in the world. The Army would then be forced to send those troops back to the United States to serve their country in other ways. The military would then have to find a way to send them back to their home countries. with the governments of Romania and of Bulgaria in 2005 and 2006, respectively, which will allow DOD access to facilities and training sites. EUCOM also provided specific details on sites no longer considered cooperative security locations in Bulgaria, Romania, and Poland, such as sites with no operational importance and a commercial facility readily available for military use that did not require U.S. investment or presence. This article includes information provided by EUCOM on the status of ongoing transformation realignments in its security locations into one. Last year, EUCOM’s master plan did not explain the potential effect of implementing base realignment and closure recommendations on the movement of troops from Germany to bases in the United States. EUCOM and Army officials told us that any delay installations while they remain open. This year, the overseas master plan identified that the baseRealignment andclosure recommendations supported overseas restructuring and that EUCOM's transformation depends on this effort. Last year, CENTCOM's master plan only made general references to operations in Iraq. Alliance or the requirements of a rapidly changing area of responsibility while seeking to preserve assets with enduring value to its missions, goals, and national interests. EUCOM also explained that its transformation execution depends on host nation negotiations, political-military considerations, base realignment and closure, and fiscal limitations. CENTCOM’s master plan for the future of the U.S. military is still to be determined, EUCOM said in a statement. The U.N. secretary-general is expected to meet with EUCOM leaders in December. EUCOM's master plan stated that the United States signed individual agreements with South Korea. The U.S. was trying to establish a presence in Eastern Europe through a network of forward operating sites and cooperative security locations. EUCOM’s master plan said that the U.N. Security Council had approved a plan for a joint military exercise with the South Korean military in 2006. The plan was approved by the United Nations Security Council on September 28, 2006, and the two countries agreed to hold a joint exercise on September 30, 2006. relation to this initiative, the command did identify the need for U.S. military construction funds to support realignment costs not paid by the Japanese government. EUCOM provided information on North Atlantic Treaty Organization contributions and discussed a burden-sharing arrangement with the Government of Norway. CENTCOM also provided host nation estimates and discussed host nation costs with the government of Norway, EUCOM said in a statement. The command also said it would provide information on host nation contributions to the NATO. developing a permanent basing system that provides greater flexibility for U.S. forces in critical areas of the world. In August 2004, President Bush announced plans for a permanent base in Iraq. The base would provide temporary access to facilities in foreign countries that enable U.s. forces to train and operate in the absence of permanent ranges and bases. The system is expected to be fully operational by the end of the decade, if not earlier, according to the White House. It will be funded by a combination of federal and military sources. The integrated global presence and basing strategy is the culmination of various DOD studies, including the overseas basing and requirements study. As a part of DOD’s global realignment, in 2004 the U.S. developed capabilities in strategic locations around the world. The strategy is based on DOD studies such as the overseas presence study, and the U.-S. global posture study. For more information on the strategy, go to: http://www.dod.mil/global-realignment/integrated-global-basing-strategy. installations, such as Naval Air Station Keflavik, Iceland; Naval Support Activity La Maddalena, Italy; selected sites in Germany, Belgium, and Turkey. The plan also recognized that current U.S. basing may not adequately support either strategic changes in an expanding North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It also recognizes that the current basing system may not be able to meet the needs of the U.N. Security Council or the European Union at the present time. It is also recognizing that basing in the region is not currently in the best interests of the United States. installations, and not for new and emerging requirements outside existing basing structures. As of fiscal year 2006, DOD had 3,731 installations, with 766 installations located overseas. In recent years, DOD has been undergoing a transformation to develop a defense strategy and force structure capable of meeting changing global threats.

In September 2001, DOD issued its Quadrennial Defense Review Report, which addressed, among other issues, reorienting the U.s. military global posture. The report called for greater flexibility for the military to respond to threats worldwide, such as terrorism, cyberattacks, and natural disasters. The Pentagon has also been looking at the role of the military in the fight against terrorism. This year, all of the commands categorized their installations into applicable base categories of main operating base, forward operating site, and cooperative security location. The commands also supplemented the information on base categories with detailed data on the installations’ capabilities, overall mission, population, and types of equipment and facilities located at each site. For example, CENTCOM and EUCOM also identified adjustments to the base categories, such as redesignating a main Operating Base as a forward Operating site or consolidating two cooperative security locations. The plan also reflected land return actions in Kuwait and Uzbekistan. Changes to base category designations, such as consolidation of a cooperative security location into a forward operating site, support surge capability for ground force support. All of the commands addressed the extent of their environmental concerns. The plan was approved by the U.N. Security Council on July 25. It was approved on July 26. It is expected to be implemented by the end of the year. The U.S. military says the plan is a success. We did not include Northern and Southern Commands in our review because they have significantly fewer facilities outside of the United States. We conducted our review from September 2006 through July 2007 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing. There are also four functional unified combatant commands that are assigned worldwide functional responsibilities not bounded. In addition, we didn't include Southern and Northern Commands because these commands have significantly less facilities overseas than the other regional commands in the Pacific, Europe, and Central Asia. The U.S. Central Command is based in San Diego, California. in the central Asian states), as well as identifying the requirements for equipment and facilities to support the mission at the site. All of the commands provide similar information for their main operating bases, forward operating sites, and cooperative security locations. Even with the department’s effort to update the plans, the plans are not likely to be updated in the near future, according to the U.S. State Department. The U.N. has a long history of updating its plans in response to changing circumstances. are linked to ongoing operations. Facility requirements and costs, time frames for an end state, base categories, host nation funding levels, and effects of other defense activities. For example, the U.S. Navy has more than 1,000 ships and submarines in the Persian Gulf. The Navy has about 1,500 ships and submarine vessels in the Gulf of Mexico. The U.N. has about 2,000 troops in the region, including more than 700 in the Middle East and more than 100 in the Pacific. European Command; U.S. Army Europe; Commander, U.s.

In general, we discussed the reporting requirements contained in OSD’s guidance, host nation agreements and funding levels, and other issues of interest to the European community. We also discussed the need to increase the number of troops in the European Theater of Operations. focus first on the mission and then on requirements by providing the type of mission the site has (such as providing logistical support), the unit that it could host, and its role in the region.

CENTCOM covers the Horn of Africa—including Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Djibouti, and Sudan. The new U.S. Africa Command eventually will encompass the entire continent of Africa except for Egypt, which will continue to fall under CENTCOM’s area of responsibility. Discussions are ongoing on the possible headquarters location and what kinds of military forces would be assigned to the command. the Indian Ocean islands off the coast of southeast Africa; and CENTCOM coordinates efforts in the Middle East, the Horn of Africa, and Central Asia. Not shown are Northern Command, which coordinates activities in North America, and Southern Command,which coordinates in South America, Central America, the Caribbean and the United States of America. The U.S. military says it has more than 2,000 troops based in the region, including more than 1,000 in Afghanistan and more than 100 in Iraq.  CENTCOM’s master plan identified how future basing and infrastructure will be defined by ongoing contingencies and global defense posture. The commands continue to focus first on the mission and then on the infrastructure requirements needed to support the mission. For example, in CENTCOM's master plan, the descriptions of each forward operating site requirements in theater are included in the plan. In the plans provided useful information on evolving costs and facility requirements in overseas basing. The plans have provided more comprehensive data every year since 2004, but two key topics continue to be omitted. CENTCOM officials emphasized that infrastructure requirements in their master plan directly supported and responded to ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The plan discussed efforts to solicit host nation contributions and the amount of coordination and support that is needed from DOD, the State Department, and Congress. CENTCOM’s intention to sustain long-term access to locations across its area of responsibility. effects of such operations on other installations and facility requirements outside of Iraq in CENTCOM's area of control. The master plan was released on October 1. forces from Seoul and other locations. Last year, CENTCOM did not report any environmental issues. This year, EUCOM identified areas for cleanup, groundwater investigation, and monitoring and discussed contamination at one site that did not present an unacceptable risk to human health or the mission. Though a senior CENTCOM official said there were no environmental issues, a senior EUCOM official added that there were concerns about groundwater contamination at a site in South Korea that could pose a health risk to personnel and the military. CENTCOM’s master plan identified funding requirements for a wastewater treatment plant and a water treatment and distribution system at Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan. The extent to which there were no environmental issues last year in the command's area of responsibility is not known. This year, the master plan identifies funding requirements to build the plant and water treatment system in hopes of avoiding potential environmental problems. The master plan is expected to be completed by the end of the year or early next year. It is not yet known how much the project will cost. costs. This year, all of the regional commands identified their precise facility requirements and costs for fiscal year 2008 and for fiscal years 2009 through 2013. In addition, CENTCOM provided information on supplemental appropriations for facilities and projects at Bagram. For more information on Bagram, visit the Bagram Operations Center at http://www.bagramoperations.org/.

Of this amount for the move, the Government of Japan has agreed to contribute move forward. DOD officials costs of the Marine Corps in Okinawa in the form of host nation support that will be borne solely by DOD after the move. For example, the DOD Inspector General reported that the relocation to Guam will increase the Marine corps’ annual funding requirements by $465 million for operations and maintenance.will eventually be identified once further information is available on the master plan. If the Futenma replacement facility in Okinawa (a facility intended to replace the Marine. Corps Air Station futenma) is not built, the relocation may be delayed. relocating 8,000 marines and their estimated 9,000 dependents to Guam. The initiatives also include the relocation of Carrier Air Wing Five from Atsugi Naval Air Facility to Iwakuni Marine Corps Air Station, Japan. Approximately 10,000 marine plus their dependents are expected to remain on the island of Okinawa following the realignment of forces. While these broad estimates provide a baseline, according to officials we visited, the Marine Corps is still determining how many marines will remain on Okinawa. environmental effects associated with relocating Marine Corps command, air, ground, and logistics units from Okinawa to Guam. The environmental impact statement will examine potential effects from activities associated with Marine Corps units’ relocation to include operations, training, and infrastructure changes. For example, according to Marine Corps Forces, Pacific, officials, the Marine Corps in Guam will depend on strategic military sealift and airlift to reach destinations in Asia that will be farther away than was the case when the units were based in Okinawa. burden on local Japanese communities and create a continuing presence for U.S. forces by relocating units to other areas, including Guam. This initiative also includes a significant reduction and reorganization of the Marine Corps posture on Okinawa, Japan. The Marine Corps forces remaining on Okinawa will consist of Marine Air-Ground Task Force elements, such as command, ground, aviation, and Logistics Group Headquarters. The 3rd Marine Expeditionary Forces Command Element, Third Marine Division Headquarters, 1st Marine Air Wing Headquarters, and 12th Marine Regiment Headquarters will be relocated to Guam. analysis and the individual service and joint planning processes. DOD identified some Marine Corps units for relocation as a part of realignment initiatives. The mix of units is significant because the functional and base support requirements will be based on the type, size, and number of units that will relocate to could accommodate any type of military units that may relocate to Guam. However, in the absence of information on the number and mix of forces, it will be difficult to provide an accurate assessment of specific facility requirements.  Guam provides strategic flexibility, freedom of action, and prompt global action for the Global War on Terrorism, peace and wartime engagement, and crisis response. About 29 percent of the U.S. military's logistical support system is based in Guam. Guam serves as an important forward operational hub for a mix of military mission requirements, according to DOD. The island is home to more than 2,000 military personnel, including more than 1,000 sailors and airmen, and about 1,200 airmen. from Okinawa to Guam, to construct a Navy pier for a transient aircraft carrier, and to station an Army ballistic missile defense task force. However, it does not include the costs of other defense agencies to support the additional military personnel and dependents on Guam. According to JGPO, these costs are in excess of $1.5 billion per year for the next five years. The cost of moving the U.S. military base to Guam is estimated to be in the region of more than $1 billion a year. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma in hopes that it will lessen the effect of military aviation operations on the local citizens of Japan. U.S. Forces Japan identified decreasing funds for the Japanese facilities improvement program. The Government of Japan may encounter challenges in funding its share of the Marine Corps move considering Japan’s other national security concerns. The success of the Futenman replacement facility is a key objective of the initiative that will need to be completed in order for other realignment actions to take place. of the U.S. Marine Corps Futenma Air Station, Japan. transformation of Army headquarters at Camp Zama, Japan; deployment of a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier at Yokosuka Naval Base. deployment of transportable ballistic missile defense radar system. relocation of training activities; land returns; and shared use of facilities.

In contrast, the PACOM plan described the training limitations involving bombing and live fire training ranges and the effects of airspace access restrictions in Japan on C-130 training. In addition, the plan discusses how noise and land use sensitivities and maneuver area limitations in Okinawa require a change in the training plans for the U.S. Air Force to be implemented in the coming years. The plan also describes the training limits for the United States Air Force in the event of an attack on Japan. fire artillery training, amphibious landings, and tracked vehicle operations will be challenging because of the combination of factors associated with the limited size of training areas available on the Northern Mariana Islands. Still, they are optimistic that the study, which will include environmental limitations, facility, facility and other factors, will be successful. The study will be completed by the end of the year or early next year, according to the U.S. Air Force base in Saipan, which is home to the Marianas Islands. The plan also discussed efforts by U.S. Forces Japan and the Government of Japan to engage in bilateral discussions to address training shortfalls and explore solutions. We have previously discussed the need to deploy to other Pacific Rim locations to supplement their training, which results in additional transportation requirements and costs. The plan also discusses efforts by the U.N. Security Council and the European Union to address the issue of troop numbers in the Pacific region. It is hoped that the plan will lead to a reduction in the number of troops deployed to the region. availability, and labor productivity for each area. In addition, Marine Corps officials expect there will be additional facility repair costs periodically as a result of damage from typhoons and seismic shocks. Several operational challenges, such as providing appropriate mobility support and training capabilities to meet Marine Corps requirements, have not yet been addressed, according to the Marine Corps' website. The U.S. Marine Corps is based in San Diego, California, and has a fleet of more than 1,000 ships and submarines. Corps force, because of inadequacy in size or lack of availability. The services are in the process of conducting a training study that includes Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands to assess the options for training in the region. Marine Corps Forces, Pacific, officials stated that live troops will not be allowed to live in the U.S. for the duration of their tour of duty in the Middle East and Africa. The U.N. Security Council is considering a ban on live troops in the Mideast and South Asia. Guam is strategically located in the Pacific Ocean approximately 3,810 miles southwest of Honolulu, Hawaii. It is 1,600 miles east of Manila, the Philippines; and 1,560 miles southeast of Tokyo, Japan (see fig. 1). Given its strategic location, Guam is an integral part of DOD’s Pacific Command. Guam is the westernmost territory of the United States and is part of the U.S. Pacific Command, which is based in San Diego, California. is also planning on basing a ballistic missile defense task force in Guam, though the size and mix of this task force as well as the infrastructure requirements are still being determined. At the time of this review, Army officials projected that the missile defense site will be located at Guam. The U.S. Army is also planning to build a missile defense base in Hawaii. The base is expected to be completed by the end of the decade, according to the Army's review of missile defense plans.  Guam is located in an area of the Pacific commonly referred to as Typhoon Alley, where on average 31 tropical storms develop annually. Also, earthquake risk in Guam is caused by the island’s proximity to the Mariana Trench, which leads to earthquakes throughout the island. of damage from typhoons and seismic shocks. Guam is in the Pacific Ocean and lies in the typhoon-prone region of Typhoon Alley. The island is home to more than 1,000 islands and is located on the Pacific typhoon path. well-developed master plan to efficiently use the available land and infrastructure. In July 2006, the committee recommended deferral of two military construction projects at Andersen Air Force Base that were included in the President’s budget request. The site may be located elsewhere depending on the capability that will be brought to Guam. DOD faces several significant challenges associated with its master planning effort for Guam, including funding requirements, operational challenges, and community impacts that could adversely affect the development of the base. The base is located on the island of Guam. determined. According to Navy officials, a new carrier pier with additional capabilities will need to be constructed in order to accommodate this plan. Most of the aircraft from the aircraft carrier will also require temporary beddown at Andersen Air Force Base, which may cause additional facilities requirements. The Army is also working on a plan to send the U.S. Navy's F/A-18 Super Hornet to the Middle East. The plan is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Examine the Navy’s plan to enhance the infrastructure, logistic capabilities, and pier/waterfront facilities to support transient nuclear aircraft carrier berthing at Naval Base Guam. The environmental impact statement will examine potential effects of the waterfront improvements associated with the proposed transient berthing. Evaluate placing a ballistic missile defense task force berthing a transient aircraft carrier and the exact size and mix of the Army missiledefense task force. In the future, the Navy is planning on periodically berthing an aircraft carrier in Guam and the support facilities needed for this ship are still being developed. on strategic lift for its operational and training- related movement needs, including transportation of forces and equipment. For example, in a contingency operation that requires sealift, the ships may have to deploy from Sasebo, Japan, or another location to transport soldiers and equipment in Guam and then return to the area of responsibility where the contingency is taking place. According to Marine Corps officials, amphibious shipping capability and airlift capacity are needed in Guam. The Marine Corps estimated additional costs for strategic lift operating from Guam. are in poor condition and, when ordnance (ammunition and explosives) is unloaded from ships for the Air Force now and for the Marine Corps in the future, it must be transported on one of these major roads that runs through highly populated areas. (2) the Government of Guam plans a Guam plans to build a new military base in the island's capital city of Hagatna, on the island of O'Hare. The U.S. Air Force has a base in Guam, and plans to expand it. The Senate report also directed GAO to review DOD’s master planning effort for Guam. Congress should consider requiring the Secretary of Defense to report periodically to all the defense committees. The Guam master plan is scheduled to be completed in 2008, at which time a copy will be provided to congressional defense committees, the report says. It should be costs for the U.S. government, the Senate report says, and should be viewed in that context. and identify the exact size and makeup of the forces to support the military buildup. Senate Report 109-286 directed DOD to submit a master plan for the military buildup on Guam by December 2006. DOD did not submit the plan for several reasons that we discuss in this report. The master plan cannot be completed until the environmental impact statement is completed, a process that could take until 2009. Also, DOD faces a variety of funding challenges, operational challenges, and community impacts that may both affect the development and timing of the Guam master plan and increase the cost of the military build-up. The required environmental impact statement, which will take up to 3 years to complete, was initiated on March 7, 2007. Additional time is needed for DOD to address several challenges before JGPO can develop a Guam master plan. According to DOD would either have an adverse environmental impact or limit the choice of reasonable alternatives. DOD officials stated that performing these alternative site analyses and cumulative effects analyses will delay the Guammaster plan’s completion. Based on the expected completion of the environmental impact statements, according to JG PO officials, the master plan could be completed by the end of the year. DOD documents and officials, additional detailed service and joint planning will be required to identify specific facility, infrastructure, and funding requirements and address the challenges associated with the military buildup. Among the challenges to be addressed before JGPO can develop a Guam master plan is to complete the required environmental Guam. This determination will define the training and facility requirements, such as barracks, family housing, schools, and other infrastructure. The office was initiating a master plan that will reflect the building of flexible infrastructure. to generate land and facility requirements for basing, operations, logistics, training, and quality of life involving the Marine Corps, Army, Air Force, Navy, and Special Operations Forces in Guam. DOD officials told us that the plan was not a master plan because it did not include specific information on facility and media articles to keep abreast of ongoing activities. While we met with Special Operations Command officials, its planning efforts were not specifically required for the master plans in response to the congressional mandates. land is controlled by DOD (see fig. 2), 52 percent is privately owned, and 19 percent is under the supervision of the Government of Guam. In 2003, the Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concern that the overseas basing structure had not been updated to reflect the new realities of the post-Cold land. DOD owned about 40,000 acres of land in Guam at the time of this review—approximately 29 percent of the island. There are political sensitivities to using former DOD land areas, since local community officials in Guam are concerned with DOD’s possible expansion of land holdings. Guam is in its initial stages, with many key decisions and challenges yet to be addressed. While the Guam Integrated Military Development Plan provides information on the projected military population, units, and infrastructure that may be needed for the Guam realignments, it lacks specific information and is not intended to overall status of implementing the military buildup on Guam. DOD officials told us that their planning effort was still in its first phase and that many more decisions would have to be made before the plan could be implemented. coordinated planning efforts among the DOD components and other stakeholders. The office is expected to work closely with the Government of Japan and the local Guam government, other federal agencies, and Congress. Until DOD provides further information on how these challenges will be resolved, it will not know the precise costs of the Guam realignment plans to the U.S. government. DOD’s has begun efforts to create a successful partnership and coordinate with other federal departments and agencies. The Government of Support Activity La Maddalena, Italy. DOD officials and the Guam Integrated Military Development Plan identified several infrastructure areas that are in need of improvements. Future DOD operations may be constrained on Guam if improvements are not made to Guam’s infrastructure. DOD officials initially told Guam officials that they could.improve the local infrastructure to accommodate forecasted military and civilian growth on the island and that federal assistance is needed to meet these requirements. DOD bases in Guam, this funding is neither intended nor is it sufficient to improve the infrastructure throughout the island. implement force structure plans with currently held land although they are now reviewing the possibility of using additional land to prevent future encroachment. For example, the Guam Integrated Military Development Plan considered both existing and former DOD land areas for potential use to accommodate realignment actions. In terms of existing land, there are currently no plans to use any of the existing land for military purposes. There are no plans at this time to use existing land to accommodate any future military realignment. There is no plan to use current land for any other purposes. The environmental impact statement will examine potential effects from activities associated with the task force to include operations, training, and infrastructure changes. DOD officials recognize that the results of this environmental assessment process may affect the development and timing of DOD’s plans for Guam. The exact size and makeup of the forces to be moved to Guam are not yet identified. (approximately 630 servicemembers and 950 family members) in Guam, according to DOD officials. The environmental assessment will examine the potential effects of operations and training, as well as infrastructure changes on Guam. plan may not be completed until fiscal year 2009. The exact size and makeup of the forces to move to Guam and the housing, operational, quality of life, and services support infrastructure required are not yet fully known and are expected to be identified and assessed during the parallel environmental to 3 years to complete. DOD also provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which we incorporated where appropriated. We are sending the comments to the Secretary of Defense for installation and environment, who responded that congressional action is not needed. Military Task Force, the Guam Women’s Group, and the Office of the Delegate from Guam to the U.S. House of Representatives raised concerns. We did not evaluate concerns raised by the officials, but we reviewed relevant federal laws and discussed them with DOD officials. We also analyzed available reports, documents, international agreements, and other documents. We are happy to answer any questions you may have about the military presence on Guam. We will provide an update on this story when we have more information. that additional time is needed to fully address the challenges related to funding uncertainties, operational requirements, and Guam’s unique economic and infrastructure requirements. At the same time, DOD has not established a comprehensive and routine process to keep Congress informed on its progress in dealing with these issues. In the absence of this information on how challenges will be addressed in the future, Congress is not in a position to help ensure the best application of limited federal funds and the leveraging of all available options for supporting the military buildup on Guam.  Funding requirements for the military buildup on Guam are yet not fully identified and may be difficult to meet given other priorities and existing funding constraints. DOD agencies, such as the Defense Logistics Agency and Defense Education Activity, that will in light of ongoing operations and funding constraints and challenges.and implementation of the master plan. These officials said that obtaining funding for theMilitary buildup will be difficult because of the pressures the department faces in funding other defense priorities and activities, including the ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Senate Appropriations Committee noted the ambitiousness of the military construction program. We visited Naval Base Guam and Andersen Air Force Base in Guam to see the installations and future military construction sites firsthand. We also reviewed DOD’s military construction budgets for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 and planned for future years to identify U.S. funding levels and sources planned for the military buildup in Guam. To identify challenges associated with the buildup in this planning effort, we met with the Governor, legislative leaders, the Chamber of Commerce, the Civil Defense Agency and other interested parties. Japan will finance construction of family housing units in Guam, but these construction costs will be reimbursed by payments from the servicemembers’ housing allowance using U.S. funds. Furthermore, the Government of Japan’s funds will not be. in the form of rent or service charges. For example, the government of Japan will not finance the construction of a family housing unit in Guam but will pay for it through rent.

Additional costs will be incurred from building facilities that will house equipment and aircraft during inclement weather. There may be additional incidental maintenance costs as a result of the move, which will be borne by Japan and other countries. The move is expected to be completed by the end of 2015. The cost of the project is estimated to be in the region of $1.5 billion. the wastewater treatment facilities have a long history of failing and are near capacity; and the solid waste landfills have a number of unresolved issues related to discharge of pollutants. Although the Government of Japan has agreed to provide $700 million for utilities infrastructure on the island, there is still a long way to go before the project can be fully realized, the report says. The report concludes that the project should be scaled up to meet the needs of the island's growing population. The project is expected to be completed by 2015.  PACOM did not identify specific host nation funding from the Defense Policy Review Initiative. The Government of Japan has not made an official, public estimate of the costs for several major realignments within Japan. This year, PACOM discussed this topic as well as the progress of bilateral negotiations with Japan. The potential decrease in traditional Japanese construction funding that would help Japan offset its Defense PolicyReview Initiative costs, such as those associated with the relocation of U.S. Marines to Guam, was also discussed. DOD’s Defense Policy Review Initiative established a framework for the future of U.S. force structure in Japan. At the time of our review, the Japanese legislature had approved $228 million for planning and initial construction funds for force posture realignments, including efforts for project planning. The review was designed to create the conditions to reduce the priorities and its commitments associated with funding several other major realignmentments of US forces in Japan under the Defense Policy review Initiative. It was also intended to reduce costs associated with the realignment, including planning and construction costs. Japan anticipates the Government of Japan will continue to decrease these funds on the basis that in addition to this program and other forms of host nation support (i.e., utilities and Japanese labor force), the Government is also responsible for providing funding for the Defense Policy Review Initiative. Japan anticipates that this will continue for at least the next few years. The U.S. Defense Department says it has no immediate plans to cut funding for Japan's defense policy review initiative. Japan says it is committed to working closely with the United States to improve relations between the two countries. about $6.1 billion to develop facilities and infrastructure on Guam. Nearly half of Japan’s contribution, or $2.8 billion, is expected to be direct contributions. The remaining $3.3 billion will consist of investment incentives for family housing and on-base infrastructure, such as utilities, which over time could be recouped by in Guam. DOD officials also expressed concern regarding the department’S ability to obtain a continuous flow of funds adequate to pay its share of the current $13 billion cost estimate for military buildup. Guam’s construction capacity has been approximately $800 million per year, as compared to the estimated construction capacity of more than $3 billion per year projected to be needed to meet the fiscal year 2014 completion date for realignment actions. Can meet this increase has yet to be determined. number of projects to upgrade the capability and efficiency of Guam's port facilities that total about $155 million with only $56 million funded. utilities transmission lines are antiquated and the system is not reliable, and voltage and frequency fluctuations are common. to be nearly $88 million annually. Existing training facilities and ranges on Guam are not sufficient to meet the training requirements of the projected Marine Corps force. The effects of the increase in military forces, in terms of population and military infrastructure, on Guam’s unique economic and infrastructure requirements have not been fully addressed. The current population of Guam is less than 1,000 people, compared to more than 2,000 for the U.S. Navy. The projected Marine force is expected to grow to about 6,000 by the end of the decade. $13 billion cost estimate includes costs to move Marine Corps forces Afghanistan and procurement costs for weapons systems. Guam is one of the more expensive locations for military construction in comparison with other locations in the United States and its territories. Guam facility development costs are 2.64 times more expensive than the baseline average for the U.S. and its territorial territories. The Government of Japan has paid a large portion of the operation and maintenance the region for the past few decades. The Marine Corps says additional costs will occur when constructing to Guam's typhoon and seismic standards. is estimated to be 171,000, and the projected future military population could increase it by more than 15 percent. The active duty military personnel and dependent population is estimated at 14,195 in Guam, and it is expected to increase to 39,130. The population could also swell further because DOD’s estimates do not include DOD civilians, contractors, or Navy transient personnel from an aircraft carrier. According to Navy officials, transient personnel could add as many 5,000 personnel on Guam during a port call.  Guam realignment actions will have significant effects on Guam’s unique economic and infrastructure requirements. Construction demands for infrastructure will exceed the availability of local contract labor on the island. The extent to which the Guam local community and foreign workers support facilities and services, such as housing and medical care for these workers, will also have an impact on Guam's infrastructure. The effects of the increased demand on roads, port capabilities, and utility services—such as electrical generation, wastewater, and public infrastructure. Preliminary analysis indicates that 15,000 to 20,000 workers will be required to support the development on Guam. The increased demand for workers may require workforce training for the local population and possibly a need for foreign workers. Foreign workers would have to temporarily enter the United States on temporary nonagricultural workers visas, capped at 66,000 per year. DOD officials have already indicated that visa waivers might be needed in order to mitigate limitations on the number of visas allowed into the U.S. each year.
