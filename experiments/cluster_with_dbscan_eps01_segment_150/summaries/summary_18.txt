where it started, the 13.42 inches out of the bottom of the core. It might not make it all the way back up to [INAUDIBLE]. FRANK WARMSLEY: It'll be close. Compensate with the reg rod if you need to. 30.8. OK. And that's the end of the exercise. We'll be back in a few minutes with the results of the test. We hope to see you on "Larry King Live" next week. Michael Short: How do you know what, let's say, your dose distance relationship is? And how do you calculate all this stuff? Short: I've actually laser-cut out a little Geiger counter jig from a previous class. The international design center has a laser cutter that you can sign up to use. And it's set to just take a Geigercounter and put your sources at some fixed distance away. It's a pretty good approximation to the solid angle of something for very long distances.
