review um convolutions and and the architecture of a CNN to make this more clear and put it put it into perspective how it relates to um just standard um dense neural networks I think it's fine um so we talked I think I think most people felt okay about um the actual mechanics of doing a convolution. When you have images and a CNN you can simply just do convolutions instead of your normal matrix multiplication. You have pooling layers if you want to decrease the size of this volume because it can get quite unwieldy. so these are some things that these models wanted to optimize over time accuracy performance and model size um model size is something that has a trade-off if you get too big you lose out on other metrics like accuracy. performance is something directly corresponds to depthwise convolutions and mobile nuts for Edge Computing and things like that. You want to drastically reduce the number of computations that you want to do yep that is basically everything for today thank you guys for coming oh and there will also be a quiz. Foreign and I should turn off the zoom background blur Ry options like this oh it does show up uh yeah there's like speaker notes on your screen but there's be careful because I accidentally just put something else in the first longer okay I don't have too many but yeah there're an interview oh this is where it has speaker notes and stuff I think it's fine I donâ€™t need this man that eraser is disgusting this one yeah oh wow you're really going at it well I just think I was just too ready to go I usually uh yeah as our slides were they and put which is the product describing to replace the names of it.
