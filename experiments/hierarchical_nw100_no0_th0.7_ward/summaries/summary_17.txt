in the House based on the 2010 Census apportionment population. Table 1 also shows the impact on the distribution of seats in the House if the District of Columbia were to be treated as if it were a state. The House would have 437 seats for both a House size of 435 seats and a House of 437. The shift of 12 seats among 18 states for the 113 th Congress is due to population changes between the 2000 Census and 2010 Census. In addition, the House would be reduced by 12 seats if the D.C. were treated as a state for apportioning purposes. Table 2 shows the end of the priority list that was used to allocate Representatives based on the 2010 Census, including the District of Columbia. The law only provides for 435 seats in the House, but the table illustrates not only the last seats assigned by the apportionment formula (ending at 435), but the states that would just miss getting additional representation. Table 3 is similar to Table 2 , but the last seat is 437 instead of 435. The priority values and the population needed to gain or lose are shown in Table 3. These are the actual seats to be allocated based on the results of the 2010 Census. Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, South Carolina, Utah, and Washington will each gain one seat; Florida will gain two seats; and Texas will gain four seats. Second, if the District of Columbia were to be given a vote in the House of Representatives and treated as if it were a state in the reapportionment of congressional seats following the 2010 census, it would gain a seat or two. The House would then be reduced to 100 members. receive one Representative and North Carolina would be entitled to fourteen Representatives. Minnesota would retain its eighth seat and no other state would be affected by the change. Another way to see the impact is to examine the allocation of the last seats assigned to the states when the District of Columbia is allocated a seat (presumably the 51 st seat) The actual apportionment is done through a "priority list" calculated using the equal proportions formula provided in 2 U.S.C. §2a.(a). the 2010 census, and the House size remained at 435, Minnesota would lose a seat relative to what it is scheduled to get as a result of the 2010 Census. Third, if, on the other hand, the District of Columbia were to be given a vote in the House of Representatives and treated as if it were a state, Minnesota's delegation would fall to seven Representatives. The House size was increased from 435 to 437 in the 2010 Census and Minnesota's delegation would fall to 7 Representatives. a seat do not change if DC is treated like state, as DC is entitled the constitutional minimum of one Representative. DC is also entitled to a seat in the House of Representatives if it is treated as a state. DC currently has one seat in Congress, which would change if it were to become a state, but not if it was treated like a city. DC has one Representative in the Senate, which could change if the state were to be considered a city, and one in the state legislature. A House size of 468 would have resulted in no state losing seats held from the 112 th to the 116 th Congresses. However, by retaining seats through such an increase in the House size, other state delegations would become larger. For example, California's delegation size, for example, would be 56 instead of 53 seats, Texas's delegationSize would increase from 53 to 56 seats, and New York's delegation would increase to 56 from 53 seats. At a House Size of 4 68, the U.S. House of Representatives would have a total of 10,306 representatives. be 38 instead of 36 seats, and Florida's delegation size would be 29 instead of 27 seats. The exceptions to this general rule occurred when states were formed from other states (Maine, Kentucky, and West Virginia). These states' Representatives came from the allocations of Representatives of the states from which the new state was formed. New states usually resulted in additions to the size of the House in the 19 th and early 20 th centuries. The exception to this was in Maine, which was formed from the state of Kentucky. When Alaska and Hawaii were admitted in 1959 and 1960 the House size was temporarily increased to 437. This modern precedent differed from the state admission acts passed following the censuses in the 19 th and early 20 th centuries. The apportionment act of 1911 anticipated the admission of Arizona and New Mexico by providing for an increase in the HouseSize from 433 to 435 if the states were admitted. New state representatives would be added to theapportionment totals.new ones had been formed. As noted above, the House sizes were temporarily increased. to accommodate Alaska and Hawaii in 1960. In 1961, when the President reported the 1960 census results and the resulting reapportionment of seats in the reestablished 435-seat House, Alaska was entitled to one seat, and Hawaii to two seats. Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Missouri each received one less seat than they would have if the House size had been increased to 438 (as was proposed by H.R. 10264, in 1962). Table 1 , below displays the apportionment. H.R. 157 / S. 160 provided for a permanent increase in the size of the U.S. House of Representatives, from 435 seats to 437 seats. The bills specified that one of the additional seats was to be allocated to the District of Columbia while the other seat would be assigned by the normal apportionment formula allocation procedure. Utah would have received the 436 th seat if the bill had passed. The bill was introduced in the 111 th Congress and died in the 112 th Congress. seat under the 2000 apportionment process. This would add a fourth seat to Utah's three ( S. 160 ). While both versions treated the District of Columbia as if it were a state for the purposes of the allocation of House seats, each bill restricted the D.C. to a single congressional seat under any future apportionments. On April 19, 2007, the House approved H.R. 1905 by a vote of 241 to 177 (Roll Call vote 231) and sent it to the Senate. S. 1257 was reported out of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs with amendments on June 28, 2007. cloture on the motion to proceed to consideration of the measure was not invoked in the Senate on a Yea-Nay vote, 57 - 42, leaving the measure pending. The 435 seat limit for the size of the House was imposed in 1929 by statute (46 Stat. 21, 26-27) A new law would require a new law setting a different limit.
