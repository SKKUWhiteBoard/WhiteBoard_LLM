HONG LIU: So if you want to compute, say, some scattering amplitude from alpha to beta-- so alpha's some initial state and beta's some final state. Say alpha consists of momentum p1 and PN-- or pm, and beta, say momentum p m plus 1 and pn. And then you can get this scattering amplitude just by taking your momentum-space correlation function, OK, for the n points. So this is obtained by doing a Fourier transform. So any questions on this? Yes? AUDIENCE: So can you explain again why this diagram, like, you have one branch and then there's a loop? The Dirac equation is one of the most beautiful equations in mathematical physics. It's actually describing electrons, so it's not only beautiful, but it's actually useful. The most general way to write it is to try to write the first-order equation which is Lorentz invariant. When you go to a different frame, the equation looks the same. Just different observers in different laboratory, that's what we mean by the equation of the Lorez transformation transform to be Lorez covariant. HONG LIU: I know some people develop psychological fears for fermions because you have to deal with those gamma matrices, OK? For a long while, actually, I have this psychological fear myself. But these are beautiful objects if you get used to them. OK, so now I will denote-- introduce a new notation so that it looks nicer. I'll denote the gamma 0 equal to i beta and then the gamma i equal to  i times beta alpha i. And then let's all pull it to the same side, and then this becomes the following equation.
