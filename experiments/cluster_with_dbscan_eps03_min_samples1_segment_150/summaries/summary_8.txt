Bayard Rustin was the chief organizer of the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Rustin grew up in a Quaker household, and began peacefully protesting racial segregation in high school. He remained committed to pacifism throughout his life, and was jailed in 1944 as a conscientious objector to World War II. In 1948, he traveled to India to learn the peaceful resistance strategies of the recently assassinated Mahatma Gandhi. He began to work with Martin Luther King Jr in 1955, and shared these ideas with him. As King’s prominence increased, Rustin became his main advisor. Rustin was passed over for several influential roles in the 1960s and 70s, but he never stopped his activism. In the 1980s, he publicly came out as gay, and was instrumental in drawing attention to the AIDS crisis until his death in 1987. In 2013, fifty years after the March On Washington, President Barack Obama posthumously awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, praising Rustin’s “march towards true equality, no matter who we are” are or who we love.” “I’m so proud of you,” she says. “You’re so beautiful.’ ““I love you, too,’ I say. I love you so much.“” I’ll always love you. ”I will never forget you. ””“We’ve been through a lot. We’d rather be here than there. ’’”
