Professor Amy Hungerford: Today it is my great privilege and pleasure to introduce Andrew Goldstone, a TF in this course. Andrew is a fourth-year student in the Ph.D. program in English, and he is writing a dissertation on the autonomy of the work of art in modernism. On Monday we had three main themes that were used to introduce this novel to you. And that's the question that I'm mostly going to focus on today. I'm going to bracket the ethical question, leave that for Monday's lecture. For Nabokov, the highest value is originality. He says this in his last Russian novel, The Gift. "Any genuinely new trend in art is a knight's move, a change of shadows, a shift that displaces the mirror," he says. "In other words, there is another form of perverted desire hiding behind the one in front of us that's hiding behind one in the back" "I want to show you that way of writing very early in the book on page 10 now," he writes. Nabokov says he had to invent America because it wasn't given to him. He lives in a kind of denaturalized world, a world where everything has to be decoded, he says. Nabokov's wife, Vera, drove him around the country while he was writing the novel. He says the evocations of the American landscape are the closest he's come to pure beauty. "I think the source of the most appealing writing in this book's so let's look at it now," he writes.
