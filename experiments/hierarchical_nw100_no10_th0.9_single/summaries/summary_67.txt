On October 14, 2011, the House passed the Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act ( H.R. 2273 ). On August 2, 2012, the Coal Ash Recycling and Oversight Act of 2012 (S. 3512) was introduced in the Senate. The bills would have created a framework that states could use to create permit programs for the "management and disposal" of coal combustion residuals (CCRs) The approach to creating state permit programs was largely the same in each bill. Legislation addressing CCRs may be considered in the 113 th Congress.
