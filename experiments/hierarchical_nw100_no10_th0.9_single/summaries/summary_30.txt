Section 808 of the NDAA for fiscal year 2012 limited DOD’s total obligations for contract services in fiscal years 2012 through 2014. The limit does not apply to contract services for military construction, research and development, and services funded for overseas contingency operations. The spending limit identified in the act applies to DOD in its entirety. Congress has also enacted legislation to improve the availability of information on DOD”s acquisition of services and to help the department make more strategic decisions about the appropriate workforce mix of military, civilian and contractor personnel.
