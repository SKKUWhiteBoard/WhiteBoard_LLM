In this problem, we're going to be dealing with a variation of the usual coin-flipping problem. But in this case, the bias itself of the coin is going toBe random. And we're told that the expectation of this bias is mu and that the variance of the bias is some sigma squared. So how do we go about calculating what this is? Well, the problem gives us a int. It tells us to try using the law of iterated expectations, but in order to use it, you need to figure out what you need the condition on. The problem also defines the random variable x. X is the total number of heads within the n tosses. Or you can think of it as a sum of all these individual xi Bernoulli random variables. We can remember that linearity of expectations allows us to split up this sum. And so each of these expectations of xi should be the same, no matter what xi is. Each one of them is mu. We already calculated that earlier. And there's 10 of them, so the answer would be n times mu. The law of total variance will tell us that we can write the variance of x as a sum of two different parts. The first is variance of the expectation of the variance. And the second is the conditional expectation of x given Q. The final answer is just a combination of these two terms. This one and this one. And now, let's try doing it another way. And we can actually use a formula involving the covariances of x. And that is actually a covariance of sigma squared. An art that you learn through more practice. But one good rule of thumb is, when you have kind of a hierarchy or layers of randomness, it's useful to condition on the layer above where that is, in this case, the random bias of the coin itself. Once you condition on that layer above, that makes the next level much simpler. Because you kind of assume that you know what all the previous levels ofrandomness are, and that helps you calculate what the expectation for this current level.
