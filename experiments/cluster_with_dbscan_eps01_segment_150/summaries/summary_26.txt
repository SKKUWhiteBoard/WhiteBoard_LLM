and do the same chemistry, but they have different metal cofactors depending on where they evolved. The function in all cases is to generate a radical in the active site and then the chemistry is the same in all these things. And the function of the metalcofactors in all case is to create a radical, which is the key to the chemistry in all of these cases, says Dr. Michael Bociurkiw, a professor of chemistry at the University of California, San Diego. Joanne Stubbe's lab works on the only cool enzyme in the world-- ribonucleotide reductase. It's the only way in all organisms that you make the building blocks de novo that are required for DNA biosynthesis and repair. If you inhibit this enzyme, you have no building blocks. You can't survive. So from a practical point of view, it's the target of drugs they use therapeutically in the treatment of cancer. And I think in probably not so distant future in the antibacterials because there are sufficient differences between humans and bacteria reductases.
