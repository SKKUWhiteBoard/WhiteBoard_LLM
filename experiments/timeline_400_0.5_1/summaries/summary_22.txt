Robotics is a really cool and important direction for the future. I really believe that in the future we will have AI assistance whether they are embodied or not to act as our guardian angels. These agents will help us with cognitive and physical work. With AI we will see such a wide breadth of applications for instance these technologies have the potential to reduce and eliminate car accidents. We have three types of learning and you have seen different aspects of these methodologies throughout the course we have supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. This work um computers needed about 10 minutes to analyze an image can you imagine okay so how do you go from that to enabling an autonomous vehicle to drive at 90 kilometers an hour well um what they did was they developed some very fast solutions for paring down the image to only the the the aspects that they needed to look at. The other thing that happened in autonomous driving was that the lidar sensors decreased the uncertainty and increased safety and today we have many companies and groups that are deploying self-driving cars.
