Atas model shows what happens if aggregate demand increases and firms respond to this by saying we want to make more output. As people demand these higher wages shortening our supply curve decreases basically all the way back to essentially where it was before. The price of tuition to Missouri State goes down but my wage is fixed under contract right and so they're gonna have to pay me the Saints of tuition declines and my input prices stay the same that's bad for them and bad for all of the firm's too.
