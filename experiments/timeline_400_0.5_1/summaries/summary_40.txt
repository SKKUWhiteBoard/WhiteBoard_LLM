Danqi Chen is one of the foremost researchers in question answering. She is the professor at the Princeton University. Danqi once upon a time was the head TA of CS224N. She's quite familiar with the context of this class. So today I'm very happy to introduce to you some of the fundamentals in this field, as well as on cutting edge and state of the art topics. So here's my plan for this lecture. I would give a brief introduction of what question answering is. And then today, delighted to have our first invited speaker. The goal of question answering is to build systems that can automatically answer questions posed by humans in our natural language. Question answering, or, let's say QA in short, is one of the earliest NLP tasks, and the early systems can even date back to the 1960s. IBM Watson has been shown to beat two national champions in Jeopardy answering questions at least at least once in the past. The question and answer has enabled a lot of really useful real world applications, for example, today if you just put your question in a search engine.
