In this problem, we're given a collection of 10 variables, x1 through x10, where each i, xi, is a uniform random variable between 0 and 1. And we'd like to develop a bound on the probability that some of the 10 variables being greater than 7 using different methods. In part A we'll be using the Markov's inequality written here. And in part B, we'll use the Chebyshev inequality, which takes into account the variance of random variable x. subtract out its means, which is E of the same summation, and further, we'll divide out, what we call normalize, by the standard deviation of the summation. So if we perform this procedure right here, then as the number of terms in the sums going to infinity, we will actually see that this random variable will converge in distribution. And since we know how the distribution of a standard normal looks like, we can go to table and look up certain properties of the resulting distribution. So that is a plan to do.
