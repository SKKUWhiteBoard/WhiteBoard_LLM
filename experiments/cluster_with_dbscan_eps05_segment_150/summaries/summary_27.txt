Derivative is a linear operation. The product rule fg prime plus gf prime. The quotient rule. And above all, the chain rule. The derivative of this-- of that chain of functions, that composite function is the derivative of f with. respect to g times the derivative. of g with respect to x. That's really-- that it's chains of functions that really blow open the functions or we can deal with. OK so I want to take that derivative, I notice the t is appearing there in the usual place, and it's also inside the integral. this isn't so practical. Tangent parabola, quite practical. Higher order terms, less-- much less practical. But the formula is beautiful because you see the pattern, that's really what mathematics is about. They all fit that pattern and when you add up all the terms, if you have a nice function, then the approximation becomes perfect and you would have equality. And those are the best functions of mathematics and exponential is of course one of them. OK that's calculus. Well, part of calculus. Calculus is the big application of calculus, so it's kind of interesting to see what part of calculus actually get used in differential equations. The derivative of x to the n, the derivative of sine and cosine. Above all, the derivatives of e to the x, which is e tothe x. And I'm going to show you what I see, and it's not everything by any means, but it's some basic ideas, but not all the details you learned.
