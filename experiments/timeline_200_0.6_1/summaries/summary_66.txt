see then it will go right but some extra amount of plasma or plasma fluid most of it enters into space or DC and then goes back but some which remains extra which is no drain back into sinusoids that will drain into the periphery and that will convert into length right so lymph is moving from the center to the periphery now in between the hepatocytes the parasites are draining on this side secreting on the other side what does what is the substance bile and bile is moving to the center. Early astrologists did not recognize the lymphatics so they thought there are only three system there is a branch of portal or this branch of puerto bean. At the outer corners of the hexagonal lobules we have portal areas in every portal area. Blood from both system drain into a paddock sinusoids which is moving from the periphery to the center then it collect into central vein central vein come out and they drain into sub level or wane and eventually into a hepatic vein.
