Random variables are an absolutely fundamental concept in probability theory. Let's start off with an example that in fact is a game because that's a fun way to start. We're going to play the bigger number game and here's how it works. There are two teams, and Team 1 has the task of picking two different integers between 0 and 7 inclusive, and they write one integer on one piece of paper. They turn the two pieces of paper face down so the numbers are not visible, and the other team then sees these two Pieces of paper whose other side has different numbers written on them. The game is that Team 2 wins if they wind up with the larger number. They're going to look at the number on the paper that they expose. And then, based on what that number is, they make a decision, stick with the number they have or switch to the other unknown number. So which team do you think has an advantage here? Course, if you've read the notes, you know. But if you haven't been exposed to this before, it's not really so obvious. picks its larger and smaller cards randomly, it's going to be another example of a number produced by a random process. And likewise, the number of the smaller card. So that's enough examples. This little game has a whole bunch of random variables appearing in it. And in the next segment, we will look again officially, what is the definition of a random variable? We will also look again at the concept of "randomness" in the game of cards and dice.
