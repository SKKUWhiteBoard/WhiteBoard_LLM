then we are going to continue with the second part of the lecture today which focuses on the problem what actually happens if the gaussian assumption that i have about my constraints doesn't hold. As you will see in some small examples having this outliers in your optimization problem is something which hurts dramatically which actually screw up your solution. Already a few outliers can lead to a environment model which is completely unusable for doing any navigation task so where the geometry of what you computed doesn't fit to the real world geometry anymore and one of the questions actually how to handle that. have also experienced and if you look to those poses over here in the poses down here how those individual structures match um if you just apply let's say scan alignment you may say this may match so maybe someone has opened the door which was closed before or here is a door now closed which was open all the other scans map actually quite well. If you put already ten wrong ones in there it's quite likely to screw up it was one hundred which is still a very small number compared to 3000 or just a small fraction it will actually end up in dramatic mapping errors. The max mixture idea is actually a pretty easy idea pretty simple idea just reply funny no one has done that in robotics until recently a few years ago the first one it was actually edwin olsen and pratik um who came up with that particular with this idea of using max mixtures. The key idea the intuition behind that is if i have a constraint which has a large error so where the um the current configuration is far away from what the constraint tells me just reduce the uh or increase the uncertainty that is associated to that.
