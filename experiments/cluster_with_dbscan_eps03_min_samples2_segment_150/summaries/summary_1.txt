epsilon positive there, we should be able to find a capital number M, such that if n is bigger than or equal to capital M, 1 over n to the p is less than epsilon. So that proves number one. So number two we'll do-- we really only need to do two cases. One is p. So p equals 1 is fine, because then I just get 1 for the whole sequence. Now let me do p bigger than 1. And if p is bigger. than 1, the absolute value of p to the 1. over n minus 1-- this is just p to. the 1 this thing times n plus 1. Convergent sequences are bounded, so-- and they have convergent subsequences. Limsup and liminf are also two important objects that arise in analysis. If they exist, there are going to be certain limits, so it's not clear that they exist at all to begin with. But we'll show that they always do exist. We define limsup x sub n, and sometimes I'll write n goes to infinity underneath. And the liminf is similar, except it's now with infs. such that the limit as k goes to infinity of x sub n sub k equals liminf of xsub n. And again, this is a subsequence of a convergent sequence, so it's convergent and convergence of the same thing, L. So that implies that this thing is equal to L. And therefore, the limsup and the liminf equal each other, and they also equal the limit of the original sequence. That is the end of the proof of this theorem. CASEY RODRIGUEZ: We proved two theorems last time, and we used them for-- and we had a couple of applications of them. The first was that a sequence converges to x if and only if the limit as n goes to infinity of the absolute value of xn minus x goes to 0. And then we also had the squeeze theorem, that if you have three sequences-- a sub n, b subn, and x sub n.
