When ore was depleted, miners often left behind a legacy of abandoned mines, structures, safety hazards, and contaminated land and water. After cleanup became mandatory, many parties responsible for hardrock mining sites have been liquidated through bankruptcy or otherwise dissolved. Under these circumstances, some hardrockmining companies have left it to the taxpayer to clean up the mining. BLM, the Forest Service, EPA, and OSM play a role in cleaning up these abandoned mining sites and ensuring that currently operating sites are reclaimed after operations have ceased.
