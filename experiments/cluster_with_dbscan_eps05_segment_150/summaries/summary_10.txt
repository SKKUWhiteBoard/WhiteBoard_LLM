Bogdan Fedeles: Today we're going to be talking about Problem 2 of Problem Set 4. We'll be discussing in detail the mechanism of HMG-CoA synthase, a key enzyme in central metabolism. The enzyme is responsible for making the five carbon building blocks from which all sterols, such as cholesterol and steroid hormones, are made. The reaction will start by forming this thioester between the acetoacetyl- CoA carbons and the cysteine in the active site of the enzyme. experimental work and evidence. The study of the effects of drugs on the human body was conducted in the 1970s and 1980s. The results of the study were published in a book called "The Effects of Drugs on the Human Body" The book was published by Oxford University Press in 1989. It was the first of its kind to be published in the U.S. and is published by Simon & Schuster, a division of Simon and Schuster Inc. in New York.
