PhilipPE RIGOLLET: What I want is to have a small bias, hopefully a 0 bias. If this thing is 0, then we see that the estimator is unbiased. So this is definitely a property that we are going to be looking for in an estimator, trying to find them to be unbiased. But we'll see that it's actually maybe not enough. Something that's slightly better is the risk, really the quadratics risk, which is expectation of.
