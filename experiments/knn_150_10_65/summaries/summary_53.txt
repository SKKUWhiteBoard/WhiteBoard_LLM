Markus Klute: We're starting a new chapter in which we look at tests and implications of special relativity. One experimental test is stellar aberration, which we discussed can be explained by special relativity and by velocity addition. In all of this experimentation and experimental verification, it's important to understand the importance of uncertainties in the scientific process overall, Klute says. He says one needs to be open minded and scientifically open minded to study and grow to the question of whether or not Einstein's theory is correct.
