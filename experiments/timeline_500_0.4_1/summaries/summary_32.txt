Grenade algorithm uses a minimal set of three-point correspondences to solve the camera pose estimation problem in the grenade formulation. The disadvantage of this particular formulation is that it ends up with a four degree polynomial which means that it could give up to a total of four possible solutions. The question becomes whether can we find the solution directly from any four point correspondences such that the solution is unique? The answer is yes and it was formulated by quan at all in a paper that was published in the 1990s. forms a plane then this is also a degenerate case and that's the end of today's lecture thank you mx equals to zero. Mx is the letter that starts with the letter "m" and ends in "x" mx is also the letters that start with the letters "n" and "o" mX is the word that begins with "n", and ends with the word "n". mx means "one" and n is the number of a person or object.
