RAFAEL JARAMILLO: Today, we're going to discuss the many D's of thermodynamics. We'll talk about lowercase d, lowercase Greek d, and uppercase Greek D. Jaramillo: Of the three D's, the U.S. D is the one that contains the most physical, unstated assumptions. He says it is often the hardest for students to understand when you first encounter it. JARamillo says to illustrate the concept of transformation quantities, it helps to draw state function surfaces. In thermodynamics, we have many different transformation quantities that we keep track of. In material science, our most common independent variables are pressure and temperature. But for any transformation quantity, you can at least imagine, if not draw out on a piece of paper, state function surfaces corresponding to the quantity that you're trying to measure, independent variables corresponding to those variables that you are regulating, and a vertical distance. So this is illustration for an isobaric, isothermal transformation, and we're illustrating this for entropy.
