Bogdan Fedeles: Today we're going to be talking about Problem 2 of Problem Set 4. We'll be discussing in detail the mechanism of HMG-CoA synthase, a key enzyme in central metabolism. The enzyme is responsible for making the five carbon building blocks from which all sterols, such as cholesterol and steroid hormones, are made. The reaction will start by forming this thioester between the acetoacetyl- CoA carbons and the cysteine in the active site of the enzyme. energy contributes to this reaction. Both of the substrates need to bind to the enzyme. In order to do that, they need to be desolvated, that is to remove all the water molecules that surround them. The binding energy is also derived by when we align the substrate in the active site of the enzyme, we align them so closely the right geometry and within a few tenths of an Angstrom so that the right orbitals overlap and allow the reaction to happen. So also the ability to align this residue so closely that also contributes to the binding energy. a look. Here is an oxygen ester that shows a proton in alpha position. And as you know, the lone pairs on this oxygen can conjugate with the carbonyl group and form certain resonance structures. So the electrons can move like this, and then we're going to have a negative charge here and a positive charge here. And this is possible because the electrons on both oxygens are found in orbitals of comparable energies. By contrast, in the case of a thioester, we have a sulfur. experimental work and evidence. The study of the effects of drugs on the human body was conducted in the 1970s and 1980s. The results of the study were published in a book called "The Effects of Drugs on the Human Body" The book was published by Oxford University Press in 1989. It was the first of its kind to be published in the U.S. and is published by Simon & Schuster, a division of Simon and Schuster Inc. in New York. The book is available in hardback and paperback.
