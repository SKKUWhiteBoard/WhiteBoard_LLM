The 1986 amendments to RCRA established the LUST Trust Fund to finance the cleanup of petroleum releases from underground storage tanks. Until recently, states could use these funds only for cleanup and related administrative and enforcement activities. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the 2005 Act), enacted in August 2005, expanded the permitted uses of the Lust Trust Fund. States are responsible for overseeing cleanup work performed by the party responsible for performing the cleanup at sites where no responsible party can be found. In addition to the federal money from EPA, federal money can be used to clean up sites contaminated by petroleum by the Brownfields program.
