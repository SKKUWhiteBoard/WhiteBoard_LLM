the downsizing took place at DOD. As shown in table 2, DOD absorbed nearly three-quarters of the FTE reductions in fiscal year 1994. In fiscal year 1997, DOD is expected to absorb all of theFTE reductions made that year. Although federal employment levels have declined steadily in recent years, the workforce has been reduced with comparatively few RIFs, in part because of the buyouts. The non-DOD workforce is expected. to increase by a net total of 0.2 percent, according to the President’s fiscal year. year to year because of such factors as the state of the economy, the availability of separation incentives, and employees’ personal considerations, federal attrition has typically run considerably higher than 1.5 percent. In fiscal years 1982 through 1992 (the year before buyouts began at DOD), CPDF data shows that the average annual quit rate was about 8 percent. Experience has shown that some agencies may need to pare down their workforces more than others as budgets are reduced, programs are dropped. DOD, though subject to the act’s governmentwide FTE ceilings, has the authority, under earlier legislation, to offer buyouts through September 30, 1999. For both DOD and non-DOD agencies, the buyout payment was the lesser of $25,000. According to OPM data, more than 112,500 buyouts had been paid governmentwide. DOD was responsible for about 71 percent of these buyouts. The federal workforce is being reduced at a faster pace than was called for by the Workforce Restructuring Act. From September 30, 1994, through March 1995, the on-board executive branch civilian workforce dropped from 2,164,727 employees to 2,032,440 employees, a reduction of 6 percent. CPDF data show that of the 132,287 reductions in on- board personnel that took place during this time period, 48 percent involved buyouts and 6 percent came from RIFs. The remaining 46 percent involved separations without buyouts or the basis for separation was not identified in the CPDF. 2,043,300 FTE positions for fiscal year 1995. This would have resulted in a reduction of 4.5 percent from the actual fiscal year 1993 level. By the end of fiscal year 1997, the administration’s budget calls for the federal workforce to be nearly 53,000 positions below the ceiling called for by the act. At that rate of reduction, executive branch civilian agencies could meet the fiscal year 1999 FTE ceiling while still hiring nearly 28,000 new full-time employees. Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-226) placed annual ceilings on executive branch full-time equivalent (FTE) positions from fiscal years 1994 through 1999. If implemented as intended, these ceilings will result in downsizing the federal workforce from 2.08 million FTE positions during fiscal year 1994 to 1.88 million F TE positions in fiscal year 1999. To help accomplish this downsizing, the act allowed non-Department of Defense (DOD) executive branch agencies to pay buyouts to employees who agreed to resign or retire. on the assumption that positions vacated by separating employees would not be refilled by government or contractor personnel. Projected savings would be reduced if this occurred. These positions have not been reduced as a proportion of the workforce as called for by NPR. With regard to future workforce reductions, our analysis showed that in terms of absolute numbers—and given historical quit rates—the remaining annual FTE employment ceilings probably could be achieved governmentwide through attrition. Nevertheless, some agencies may be required to downsize more than others. employees who were paid buyouts from fiscal year 1993 through March 31, 1995, 52 percent were white males. The percentage of women in the workforce increased from 43.4 percent at the end of fiscal year 1992 to 44.6 percent by March 1, 1995. Total governmentwide FTE levels to date are well below the annual ceilings mandated by the Workforce Restructuring Act. Our estimates indicate that the act’s final fiscal year 1999 target for FTE ceilings could be exceeded. The percentage of supervisors at DOD agencies dipped from 12.7 percent of the workforce to 11.9 percent. All but one of the other designated management control positions increased somewhat. Non-DOD agencies came only slightly closer to meeting the NPR goals. Although it was not an explicit goal of the buyout legislation, the buyouts appeared to have helped agencies downsize without adversely affecting workforce diversity. Of the nearly 83,000 employees who delayed their separations so that they could receive a buyout. administration recommended that agencies direct their workforce reductions at specific “management control’ positions. Such positions included those held by managers and supervisors and employees in headquarters, personnel, budget, procurement, and accounting occupations. By fiscal year 1999, the administration called on agencies to increase managers’ and supervisors’ span of control over other employees from a ratio of 1:7 to 1:15, and to cut management control positions by half. In our draft report on agencies’ use of buyouts that we are preparing for this Subcommittee, we present preliminary data. reductions-in-force (RIF) We obtained information on the results of federal downsizing activities by analyzing workforce data contained in the Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) Central Personnel Data File (CPDF) for fiscal year 1992 through November of fiscal year 1996. Our estimate of the extent to which mandated workforce reduction goals can be achieved by attrition was based on workforce trends data in the President's fiscal year 1997 federal budget. The costs and savings of buyouts and RIFs were analyzed using past studies by us, the Congressional Budget Office and other federal agencies. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: We are pleased to be here today to discuss the progress being made in downsizing the federal workforce and agencies’ use of buyouts. As agreed with your office, our statement includes information on the results to date of federal downsizing efforts. We estimate that the statutorily mandated workforce reduction goals could be met through attrition, and the cost and savings implications of buy outs versus attrition. We also discuss the demographic results of the buyouts and the extent to which we estimate that they could be achieved through attrition. and/or missions are changed. In such circumstances, some agencies may not be able to meet workforce reduction goals through attrition, and other downsizing strategies, such as buyouts or RIFs, may be necessary. If it were to reduce at this pace, NASA has said that it would anticipate that Rifs would be needed. Although this downsizing proposal may or may not. be implemented, it illustrates the potential magnitude of workforce reductions being considered at some individual agencies. do so 3 years earlier. Study: Over a 5-year period, buyouts would generally result in more savings to taxpayers than RIFs. This is because buyouts usually result in the separation of employees with higher salaries and benefits. Study: Buyouts could generate up to 50 percent more in net savings than Rifs over the 5- year period following separation. But results would change if bumping and retreating did not occur in a RIF and the separated employees were eligible for retirement, authors say. such situations, buyouts or RIFs may be necessary. In comparing the costs and savings of buyouts and Rifs, our analysis showed that buyouts offered greater savings than RIF's, except when RIFed employees do not bump and retreat and are eligible to retire. This concludes my prepared statement. I would be pleased to answer any questions you or Members of the Subcommittee may have. The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
