So, last time we were starting to talk about the sort of the general overview of what reinforcement learning involves. We introduced the notion [NOISE] of a model, a value, and a policy. Can anybody remember off the top of their head what a model was in the context of reinforcement learning? So what we're gonna do today is, sort of, um, build up for Markov Processes, up to Markov Decision Processes. And this build, I think, is sort of a nice one because it allows one to think about what happens in the cases where you might not have control over the world. There exists a unique optimal value function. The optimal policy for an MDP and an infinite horizon finite state MDP is deterministic. There are two choices for every state and there are seven states. The [NOISE] number of policies is |A| to the |S|. It's a mapping from states to actions so it's gonna be 2 to the 7th. We'll talk about- probably a little bit clearer to when we talk about contraction properties later. Um, any one want to take a guess of whether or not the optimal policy is always unique? I think there might be cases where it's not.
