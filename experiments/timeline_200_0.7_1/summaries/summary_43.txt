In this section, we're going to talk about the relativistic Doppler effect. And we make good use of our space-time diagrams, which we discussed earlier. So the situation is as follows-- to simplify this, we have a source which is emitting pulses. The question now is, how is this being observed by an observer which is moving with a relative velocity v with respect to the source? So let's analyze this. We can say x1 is equal to ct1 or equal to x0, and v is the velocity in which the source is moving. is moving. And similarly for t x2, we find c times t2 minus tau. And that's also equal to x0 plus vtimes t2. So the question is not how this observed-- how this is seen by the source but how this was being seen by an observer. So we have to apply Lorentz transformation. And we find then-- this is a little bit of an algebra exercise here-- that delta t prime is equal to gamma delta t minus v over c squared delta x. that the period now is given by 1 plus beta over 1 minus beta square root of that times tau. And the frequency is the inverse. So we just calculated relativistically how the period and the frequency of a wave is Lorentz transformed. We'll have 1 minus Beta over 1 plus Beta squareroot of that [? times ?] the frequency. That's how we get the period of the wave and the rate of its movement. The period is the same as the frequency, but the rate is the opposite.
