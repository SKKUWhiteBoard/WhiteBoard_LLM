GILBERT STRANG: This is the second of the three basic partial differential equations. We had Laplace's equation, that was-- time was not there. Now time comes into the heat equation. We have a time derivative, and two-- matching with two space derivatives. So I have my function. My solution depends on t and on x, and I hope I can separate those two parts. This is exactly like the way we solved the ordinary systems of differential equations: We pulled out an e to the lambda t. Fourier series tells us how to find these Bk's. We're talking about a partial differential equation. We have numbers depending on time and decaying rapidly, and something depending on x. So at time 1, if I drew a picture, suppose the heat is, the temperature starts out through the whole bar at 1. But with this kind of time decay, a little later in time, it's going to be something like that. It'll be way down at the ends, pretty low in the middle. So that's what solutions to the heat equation look like.
