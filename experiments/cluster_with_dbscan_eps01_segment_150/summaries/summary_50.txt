Student: Do you know the basis for thinking that the context for a dinucleotide is either an ocean or an island, in other words, only two states? Why couldn't the context be five states? GEORGE CHURCH: OK. Question. Student: Why can't there be more than two states for the context of a dinoinucleotide? Student: I want to know why there can't be more states for dinosucleotides. George Church: I don't know, but I think there must be. George Church: How do we deal with multisequence alignments? Church: This is using all the power that we developed for the pairwise comparison. This does scale exponentially with k. Church: There are very good for inferring structure or function from sequence without experiments. It's like doing a huge mutagenesis and exploring viable mutants, he says. He says the most non-polynomial calculations, that is to say, in this case, in the case of this band, you could take one of the examples and take it to the next band.
