Poverty estimates are used to determine funding allocations for a variety of programs. This report discusses poverty measures developed for official, research, and administrative uses. It does not address international poverty measures, current poverty estimates, or policy responses for alleviating poverty. A family's income is compared against a dollar amount representing some measure of need, called a threshold. Those with family income less than the threshold are considered to be "in poverty," or poor. The poverty measures discussed in this report focus on financial resources. in this report focus entirely on economic needs and resources. This is only one way to assess a person's level of well-being. Other characteristics are also important to consider. These include the possession of amenities or access to public services, access to quality housing and neighborhood conditions and community services, such as public safety and quality local schools. Other indicators of well being include economic mobility (the degree to which persons at the low end of the income distribution can move higher in it) and access to opportunities for high paying jobs. The Census Bureau releases data from the official poverty measure every September for the previous full calendar year. Poverty data are obtained from surveys, and are therefore estimates that have margins of error. "Resources" in this measure are defined as money income before taxes, and they do not include the valuation of noncash benefits like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and housing subsidies. The official measure's equivalence scale was not computed directly, but rather came about implicitly because the thresholds were based on. The 1964 Economic Report of the President used a flat figure of $3,000 for families, and $1,500 for individuals not in families, to represent the poverty line. Research on poverty measurement using a more detailed measure of need began before the Johnson Administration announced the War on Poverty. In the early 1960s, Mollie Orshansky had been conducting her own analysis of poverty using food costs. The Economy Food Plan indicated the money a family under economic stress would need to spend on food for "temporary or emergency use when funds are low" For two-person families, a factor of 3.7, rather than 3, was used in order to capture the higher fixed costs faced by smaller families. Income amounts for individuals not in families were set at 80% of the amounts for two- person families. Apart from three minor methodological revisions, the above methodology undergirds the official poverty thresholds as they are used today. They are updated for inflation annually using the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). Poverty measurement, in general, involves a comparison of resources to a measure of need. The CPS ASEC uses a detailed questionnaire administered by trained representatives. Because the information comes from household surveys, there are limitations to which populations can be measured. The information used to identify family relationships comes from house surveys, and varies from survey to survey. The CPS AS EC is used for the official poverty estimates for the nation as a whole, and asks about the relationships among all household members. It is conducted primarily for the purposes of measuring the state of the nation's economic well-being. for households, but also includes some noninstitutional group quarters, such as emergency shelters and group homes. Military personnel are included only if they live in a household with at least one civilian adult. Foster children under age 15 who have not been legally adopted are excluded. Unmarried domestic partners are regarded as belonging to separate family units in the official definition of poverty, and their poverty statuses are computed accordingly. The family relationship data available through the survey can thus affect how individuals' poverty status is determined. The official poverty measure represented an improvement from the flat amounts used in the 1964 Economic Report of the President. The poverty thresholds are not adjusted to reflect geographic variations in costs. The official measure captures the effects of some but not all government programs intended to provide relief for the poor. The programs that are captured are those based on money income before taxes: Social Security, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and other programs that help the poor pay for their basic necessities. It represents an important disconnection between the way needs were specified and the definition of resources available for meeting those needs. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and any state or local relief programs based on money income. Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which, despite its large effects for low-income workers, is not captured because it is a tax credit. SNAP, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), public housing subsidies, and subsidized medical care. The official measure does not capture the needs incurred, nor the resources brought in, by household members who are not related by birth, marriage, or adoption. shifted in relation to all goods and services. It can be argued that the inflation adjustment used in the official measure does not accurately reflect the purchasing power needed, in a practical sense, to remain comparable with those at the poverty line in previous decades. There has been broad agreement among poverty scholars that the limitations noted above represent serious drawbacks to the official poverty measure. Experts within the federal government, in universities, and in private research institutions have spent decades developing approaches to address these shortcomings. In 2009, the Office of Management and Budget convened an Interagency Technical Working Group (ITWG) to consolidate the research. measure, nor did it recommend using the Supplemental Poverty Measure for administrative purposes. The thresholds were defined by costs of food, clothing, shelter, and utilities, and a bit extra to cover miscellaneous expenses. Three sets of thresholds were developed for renters, homeowners with a mortgage, and homeowners without. The measure's methodology was designed to be practical to implement, with the understanding that its methods would continue to be refined periodically, as new data source availability and research findings warranted. It was developed following recommendations made by a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) panel. a mortgage—to take account of housing costs, given that it can vary widely between these groups. The thresholds are geographically adjusted using housing data from the American Community Survey (ACS) The equivalence scale for the new thresholds uses three factors to adjust for family size: children on average consume less than adults; as family size increases, some expenses like food or clothing increase additively with each person; and the first child in a single-parent family represents a greater increase in costs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) computes the base thresholds using CE data. The official poverty measure gained its status through the Bureau of the Budget's Circular A-46, issued in 1969. OMB issued Statistical Policy Directive 14 in 1978, reconfirming the measure as official and directing federal agencies to use it for statistical purposes. The Supplemental Poverty Measure's overall effect on the poverty rate made it approximately 0.6 percentage points higher than the official rate in 2015. The profile of the population in poverty is different between the supplemental and official measures, as evidenced by noticeably higher poverty rates for some groups and lower rates for others. The official poverty measure, as described in OMB's Statistical Policy Directive 14, is based on data from the CPS ASEC. Since the 1960s, however, other datasets have been used to compute poverty status. The Decennial Census of Population and Housing was, for decades, the only available data source that could provide information on poverty for small geographic areas, such as cities and counties. The Census Bureau now releases poverty data every September from the ASEC for the prior full calendar year. The ACS provides more detail on demographic characteristics for small areas than any other data source. The ACS was designed to be filled out by the respondent on his or her own. It does not capture information on people who may be related to each other but not to the householder. Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) establishes formula grants for local education agencies based, in part, on the ACS' results. The CPS asks about fewer income sources than does the ACS. The SAIPE program was undertaken in the 1990s to provide poverty estimates for counties, and estimates of the number of school-age children in poverty for school districts. The data are model-based, meaning that they are not simply a reflection of survey responses, but are adjusted using a combination of administrative data in addition to survey data. The modeling enables the Census Bureau to produce estimates for small areas with less variability—and thus greater precision—than it could using survey data alone. Since 2005, the first year that the ACS estimates were available at its full sample size of over 3 million addresses per year, ACS data have been used as input into the model. SAHIE data are also model-based estimates for small areas. However, they have a different target population: the low-income uninsured. The SAHIE estimates are broken down by income-to-poverty ratio, uninsured status, sex, age group, and, for state-level estimates, selected racial and Hispanic origin groups. The data are used to estimate the target population for the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, coordinated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Longitudinal poverty data have been available from the SIPP since 1984. The data sources discussed thus far can be thought of as snapshots illustrating the poverty population in a given year. Shown in Table 3 are sets of dollar amounts, called poverty guidelines, that are computed and published annually by the Department of Health and Human Services. Unlike the measures discussed in this report, the poverty guidelines are not used to count the number of people or families in poverty. Rather, they are used for administrative purposes, such as determining whether an individual or family qualifies for programmatic assistance.
