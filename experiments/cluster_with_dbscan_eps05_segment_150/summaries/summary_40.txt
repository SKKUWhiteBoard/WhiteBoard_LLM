The goal of this course is to give you the tools to interpret complicated phenomena. You don't know anything unless you have a reductionist picture of what's going on. The relationship between the effective quantum number and the ionization energy of a state then provides a hydrogen-atom-based structural model for everything you can observe.

OK, so this is the end of atoms. And I've asked you to observe some complicated algebra which you're never going to do. Everything you need to know about atoms, you can tell a computer, and it can do it. Now molecules are much more complicated. And that's we're going to start on next time. We'll start with molecular orbital theory. I'm not going to be presenting the normal textbook approach. I'll present an interpretive approach, where you understand why things happen. Hermann Hissinger: Klemperer showed me, on a scrap of paper, how to do many-electron wave functions. That was it. That has been the foundation of my career for the last 50 years. He says the truth is really very complicated. You can't solve helium or any more-than-one-electrons problem exactly. But you can do it really well, and it just costs computer time, he says, and if the computer is doing the work, you don't really care.
