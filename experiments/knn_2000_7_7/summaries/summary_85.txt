liyan blake a little bit about him he's kind of out there some of his contemporaries thought he was insane you know nowadays maybe he would be heavily medicated. People think that he's out there and there was that who was William Wordsworth who said that there is something in the madness of this man which interests me more than the sanity of Lord Byron and Walter Scott. He was an individual who you know was into art and was into eventually you know religion and such became a big part of his life but his as an artist he was also big-time into painting.
