In order to do that, I basically have to do the integral. So here it is. We have psi of x and t. It's integral dk phi of k e to the ikx minus omega of kt. If you want to see the distortion, you have to keep that [INAUDIBLE]. We'll do that in a week from now. And then, you say, look. There's lots of things making it look like a difficult integral, but it's not as difficult as it looks.
