In the 5th Century BC Athens was a direct democracy that encouraged wide participation through the principle of ho boulomenos, or anyone who wishes. This meant that any of its approximately 30,000 eligible citizens could attend the ecclesia, a general assembly meeting several times a month. Some ancient philosophers, including Plato, disparaged this form of democracy as being anarchic and run by fools. Could reviving election by lottery lead to more effective government through a more diverse and representative group of legislatures?
