Mathematically, a consumer is trying to maximize his utility. And this utility maximization has to be done with respect to some constraint and the constraint the budget constraint we take P 1 x 1; P 2 x 2 should be less than or equal to I. In real life, it is possible that a person derives some satisfaction from having some money left in his pocket, but the way this problem has been framed here the personâ€™s satisfaction depends only on his level of consumption of good 1, and good 2. same consumption bundle; it is clear. So, if we solve it what do we get? Here let us say for x 1 instead of using star let me use term M I will explain what does this M, this is x 1 m is a function of P 1 P 2 and I here u naught is not fixed. What is e? E is nothing but P 1 x 1 plus P 2 x 2. We are checking we have set up the problem such that this I is equal to this U naught.
