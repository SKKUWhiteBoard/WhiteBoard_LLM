Social Security plays an important role in reducing poverty, not only among the aged but among children as well. Unlike welfare programs, eligibility is determined on the basis of limited income. Social Security is a work-related entitlement, in which benefits are determined on workers' employment and earnings history, without respect to current income. In December 2012, 3.3 million Social Security beneficiaries (5.7% of all beneficiaries) were children under the age of 18. Average monthly benefits of children of disabled workers were lowest, about $323 in December 2012.
