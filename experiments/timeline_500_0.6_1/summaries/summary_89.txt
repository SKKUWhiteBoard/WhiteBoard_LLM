NORVIN RICHARDS: Today is phonetics, which means that today we begin making funny sounds at each other. One standard way of talking about different kinds of speech sounds is to talk about where in the vocal tract the flow of air can get obstructed. So for example, there are what are called bilabial sounds. These are sounds which are made with both lips. And so that's what you do for the sounds that are at the beginnings of words like "paint" and "bath," and "mouth," and well, "wipe" English doesn't have a bilabial fricative, but there are languages that do. In English, we have a labiodental "f" with our lower lip against our teeth. In Japanese, your teeth are not involved. English has a nasal stop, "k" and "guh," and we've got velar stops in English, "nnnn" We've got a velar stop in English -- "m" -- is that nasal voiced or voiceless? Voiceless. Uvulars are kind of like "k" except more so. Retroflexes are very popular in India, and Australia, and Indonesia. Pharyngeals involve constriction near the pharyngeal wall. Appants are not stops, and they're not nasals. They involve gesturing towards each other in each part of your vocal tract, not enough to make enough to cause turbulence in the airflow. And for some reason, the dental stops are still red. I don't know why. this exercise next time. As we go along, I'm going to be asking you to read things in IPA. So I'll start putting IPA on the slides more and more. So start trying to familiarize yourself with it and get to where you're familiar with at least the symbols for sounds that we use in English. Do you want me to read the rest of them? I'll do some more IPA. OK, so what's the second one? STUDENT: "Sue says he's a bad egg."
