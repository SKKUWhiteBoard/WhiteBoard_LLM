ROTC is the largest of the three major officer commissioning programs for DOD. ROTC programs prepare college and university students to serve as officers in the military services. Most states have a unit from each service located within the state and all states have at least one unit. The military servicesâ€™ ROTT programs each came within a few percentage points of meeting or exceeding the annual officer production goals that they established to meet their respective authorized end strengths. But each service reported that various factors may affect their ability to meet these goals, and that they have faced challenges commissioning officers for certain occupational specialties.
