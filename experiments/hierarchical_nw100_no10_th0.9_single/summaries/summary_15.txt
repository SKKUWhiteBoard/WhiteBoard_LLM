Medicare now covers a number of preventive services, including immunizations and cancer screenings. Not all beneficiaries avail themselves of covered preventive services. Some beneficiaries may simply choose not to use these services, but others may be unaware that the services are available or covered by Medicare. For some beneficiaries, certain services may not be warranted or may be of limited value. Many Medicare beneficiaries may not know that they are at risk for health conditions that preventive care could detect, authors say. care depends on an individualâ€™s age and health risks, not simply on the results of a standard battery of tests.
