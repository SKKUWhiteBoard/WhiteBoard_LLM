Simple graphs are directed graphs where the arrows have a beginning and an end. A directed graph might have a self loop, an edge that starts and begins at the-- starts and ends at the same vertices. A simple graph has a nonempty set, v of vertices, and it has a set E of edges, but the edges now are somewhat different since they don't have beginnings and ends. An edge just has two endpoints that are in V, and we don't distinguish the endpoints. The handshaking lemma is an application of graph theory to sex. It asks, are men more promiscuous than women? And there have been repeated studies that are cited in the notes that show again and again that it's consistently the case that the men are assessed to have 30% more, 75% more and sometimes 2 and 1/2 times. We're going to come up with a very elementary graph theoretic argument that says that this is complete nonsense. The proof is trivial, but let's make something of this.
