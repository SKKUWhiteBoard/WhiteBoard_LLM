When you do not have unlimited amount of everything you will have to make a choice, what to produce? In what quantity you should produce a particular good. Allocation is nothing but assignment, allotment, share, but in economics we are more technical about this particular term allocation. So, allocation here means solving these three fundamental or basic questions of economics, and the first question is what to production? The second is how to produce and the third is for whom to produce. Depending on who makes these decisions we have different form of economy, who makes this decisions. but after 1991 after economic liberalization we are slowly moving towards market based economy, but we are not yet there. One concept that I would like to emphasize here is laissez faire, this is a French word it means leaving it alone. This is an extreme version of market economy where private parties are absolutely free from government interaction, intervention such as tariffs, tax, regulations. So, individuals transact without any interference of the government. But still I would say that we have mixed economy.
