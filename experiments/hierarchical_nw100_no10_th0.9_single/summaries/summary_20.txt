Following the September 11, 2001, attack on the WTC, FEMA provided funding to HHS to establish certain WTC health programs. FEMA entered into interagency agreements with HHS agencies, such as NIOSH, ASPR, and ATSDR. HHSâ€™s disaster response and recovery activities operate within an administrative and legal framework that helps to define federal agency roles and responsibilities. In fiscal year 2006, the Congress appropriated $75 million to CDC that was available for monitoring and treatment services for certain WTC responders.
