Census data remain an important element in allocating federal aid to state and local governments. Accurate census results are critical because the data are used to reapportion seats in the House of Representatives and for congressional redistricting. To help ensure the accuracy of census data, the bureau conducted a number of quality assurance programs. The Full Count Review program was designed to rapidly examine, rectify if possible, and clear census data files and products for subsequent processing or public release. It ran from June 2000 through March 2001.
