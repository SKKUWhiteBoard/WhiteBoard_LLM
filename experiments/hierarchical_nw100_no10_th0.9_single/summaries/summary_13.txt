The IG Act created independent IG offices at 30 major departments and agencies with IGs appointed by the President, confirmed by the Senate. In 1988, the IG Act was amended to establish additional IG offices located in 33 DFEs defined by the act. The presidentially appointed IGs and the DFE IGs reported to us total budget authority for fiscal year 2010 of about $2.2 billion. Although not in the scope of our review, there are 10 IGs established by other statutes with provisions similar to those in the IG act.
