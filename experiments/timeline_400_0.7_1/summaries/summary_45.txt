Marginal rate of substitution of good 1 with respect to good 2 is infinity. When we do not say when we say just MRS, we are not using any particular term, you can use both way. We will always use this, yes here is 0 and MRS here is infinity, but in both the examples MRS of cola is Infinity. So, just be careful what we are talking about. This is you know a point of confusion many people just change the axis when they talk about it. getting x you get 1 by x, and why? Let us see what do we mean by marginal rate of substitution mathematically. We want this person to have the same level of utility by consuming one of these two bundles. So, of course, when we are increasing the amount of 1 good to bring what will happen using this, if we use the monotonicity what will happened. More of 1Good and same of the other good what is happening. If one is bad, remember the definition right from the beginning if one is. bad then marginal rates of substitution would be positive, because to increase the amount. of bad you will have to compensate that person by giving more of the. other good. see, that MRS is given as a positive number, that only means that the author has introduced a negative sign here to convert the MRS into apositive number. So, it does not matter. Is it clear? Do you know the answer to this question? If so, please email us at jennifer.smith@mailonline.co.uk. If you don't, we would like to hear from you. Please send us a photo of your MRS and we will send it to you.
