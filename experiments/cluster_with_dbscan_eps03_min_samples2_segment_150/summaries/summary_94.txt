SNLI and MultiNLI into Turkish. XNLI is a bunch of assessment data sets that is dev-test splits for more than a dozen languages. Those are human-created translations that could be used to benchmark multilingual NLI systems. So there's a wide world of tasks you can explore, and I think that makes NLI a really exciting space in which to develop original systems, and projects, and so forth. And those could be interesting for seeing how well a model can grapple with variation that comes in very specific and technical domains. SNLI is the Stanford Natural Language Inference Corpus-- MultiNLI, and Adversarial NLI. The premises are all image captions from the image Flickr30K data set. All the hypotheses were written by crowdworkers. The overall Fleiss kappa measured interannotator agreement was 0.7, which is a high rate of agreement. It's clear at this point, for example, that ensembles of deep learning methods are the best for this problem, says Christopher Potts.
