Professor Steven Smith: I want to talk today about my favorite part of the Second Discourse, a book that never grows old. Last time, I focused on a famous passage in which Rousseau claims it was the establishment of private property that was the true formation of civil society. But in fact, that's not really true. Rousseau understands that even for institutions like property and civil society to be possible there must be huge and important developments that go on or take place even prior to this, moral and psychological transformations of human beings. David Frum: In Rousseau's Second Discourse, amour-propre is the chief villain. He says the French term is untranslatable in English but is related to pride, vanity, conceit. Frum says Rousseau distinguishes it from amour de soi-meme, a sort of self-love. He asks: How could pride have arisen in a state of nature that is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short?Frum: Rousseau speculates about this hypothetical history and speculates that the passion of vanity was born. Rousseau: Government is a con game that the rich play upon the poor. Political power simply helps to legitimize economic inequalities, he says. In society we only live through the opinions of others, through the gaze of others. The book offers no positive answer to the problem of civilization but only hints at the best possible solutions. Perhaps the closest approximation to primitive society is the state of primitive society, says Rousseau, in a letter to the City of Geneva, which prefaces the book in a sense, the book lauded by Geneva.
