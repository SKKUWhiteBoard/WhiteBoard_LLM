Offshoring, also known as offshore outsourcing, initially referred to the practice of U.S. businesses contracting with firms beyond U.s. borders. Offshoring has heightened public policy concerns about the extent of job loss and foregone employment opportunities. The notion that offshoring depresses job growth in the United States appears to lie underlie some policymakers' support for measures meant to encourage employment domestically rather than abroad, authors say. They ask whether the existing trade adjustment assistance programs can satisfactorily meet the needs of comparatively well-educated office workers who lose their jobs.
