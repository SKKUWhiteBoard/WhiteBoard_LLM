Since 2007, the Federal Highway Administration has amended certain national standards for traffic signs. Among the new standards were a measurable standard for the minimum level of nighttime visibility of signs. The lettering standard applies only to signs with names of places, streets, and highways. Nighttime crash rates are estimated to be three times higher than daytime rates, and the fatality rate for nighttime driving is also higher than for daytime driving. But ensuring that signs are easily visible at night is becoming a more significant safety issue.
