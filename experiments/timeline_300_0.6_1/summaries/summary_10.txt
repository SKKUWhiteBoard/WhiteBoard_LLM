which we are to for next week and here and I'll talk about that actually week from today because it's callay on Monday so it will get behind but if we get any further behind I'll have to make it up sometime the but if you don't have that you be copies available upstairs is it c um come to my office okay to dany's office he doesn't have copies of it there that's six six upstairs in the first floor immediately after CL and then on the next Friday I will talk about the parts in the in the inquiry that were assigned and also a that essay of of the oral concept. The English Constitution was at that time widely regarded this a sort of accepted view on all sides it's a hex Constitution that this problem as I say arose during the exclusion crisis of 1679 and 81. Now by definition a mixed Constitution is a constitution in which two or more constitutionally defined agents share in and each have a part in What L calls the legislative power that is the supreme power in the constitution and in the English case of course it's the crown and Parliament so we're only actually dealing with two agents in this case and neither is supreme so we want to say that they are coordinate powers. changed his mind he thought perhaps it was not all together safe never knew in England the English were regarded in those days as very unstable people uh and not now we think of them as how and settled down or any rate 200 years after that they we regard as a model and longer of stability and and political common sense. Mark was afraid well who knows uh may be different I don't want people know what I said in the past it might be unsafe. His view was that Charles II then had violated his trust and it altered the form of the Constitution and therefore the government was dissolved. and who does not have the right to vote and what the conditions on it are maybe we want to free it from that of course what I'm thinking of eventually um is that that that would be one motivation for introducing an idea like the origal position that say it's a way of conceiving how con power might be exercised. No point in criticizing someone for something they didn't intend to do okay well I think it's stop so remember there's no class here Monday so the next class here will be next Friday.
