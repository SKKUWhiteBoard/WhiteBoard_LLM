H.R. 157 / S. 160 provided for a permanent increase in the size of the U.S. House of Representatives, from 435 seats to 437 seats. Both versions treated the District of Columbia as if it were a state for the purposes of the allocation of House seats. Article I, ยง2 of the Constitution establishes a minimum House size (one Representative for each state), and a maximum House size. For the 2010 apportionment, a House size of 468 would have resulted in no state losing seats.
