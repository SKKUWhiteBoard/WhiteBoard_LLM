in this video we're going to discuss what externalities are in economics. An externality is when you do something that affects the well-being or the good of another person or a company but you're neither harmed or rewarded for what you did to that person so the externalities can be positive they can be negative. A negative exTERNality is where you've harmed someone you've done something to somehow impose a cost on someone or some some company or something and you haven't reimbursed that person. would help them sell their home because the neighborhood would look great but you don't have an incentive to do that why because you're only considering your own private benefit. If you do something nice and for your home then that would help their their home's value but they wouldn't turn around and compensate you necessarily. So that's a positive extra ality and for that reason these type of goods that have a positive externality would be undersupplied in situations where you have a negative externally like pollution or something like that.
