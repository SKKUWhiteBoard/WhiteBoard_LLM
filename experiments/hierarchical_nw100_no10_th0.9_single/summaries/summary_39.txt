Using TRLs we developed for these technologies, we found consensus among stakeholders that CCS is less mature than efficiency technologies. Commercial deployment of CCS within 10 to 15 years is possible according to DOE and other stakeholders, but is contingent on overcoming a variety of economic, technical, and legal challenges. Many technologies to improve plant efficiency have been used and are available for commercial use now, but still face challenges. Neither the final rule will address liability for unintended releases of CO emissions in lieu of more efficient coal plants.
