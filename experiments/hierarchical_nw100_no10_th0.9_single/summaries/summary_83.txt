MOBILE5a is a computer program that estimates the emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides for eight different types of gasoline-fueled and diesel highway motor vehicles. The first MOBILE model was made available for use in 1978; since that time, major updates and improvements to the model have been made. The model exists because precise information about the emissions behavior of the approximately 200 million vehicles in use in the United States is not known, yet the need exists to estimate the impact of motor vehicles on air quality.
