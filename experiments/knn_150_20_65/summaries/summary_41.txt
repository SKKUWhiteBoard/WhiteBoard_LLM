As a nurse we will transfuse a patient who is low on red blood cells with new blood cells via a venous access of some type. Red blood cells are very vital for our survival and how our body works so in other words our body can't function very well without them. Most hospitals require that you're a registered nurse in order to transfuse the blood so again follow your Hospital protocol with that. You can access the free quiz that will test you on this procedure so let's get started. matches up perfectly you're gonna look look at the patient's blood type versus the donors tie and the Rh factor. If there's a discrepancy you'll need to notify the blood bank immediately and just from personal experience this has happened with one of my patients I was doing the whole verification process with another nurse and we were looking at the blood bag. There was one letter that they had did a clerical error on so I had to send the blood and we had to go through the whole process again. If someone's having an anaphylactic reaction to something another type is febrile and this is non hemolytic so you don't have the breaking up of those red blood cells. This is where the recipients white blood cells or reacting with the donors white blood cell and this causes the body to build antibodies. You can see that increased temperature like one degree Celsius or one point eight degree in Fahrenheit from the baseline. Another transfusion reaction you can have is the GVHD the graft-versus-host disease and again like I said this is rare but it's deadly.
