There's no age, education, profession, or even native-born citizenship requirement. Most presidents nominate individuals who broadly share their ideological view. So far, six justices have been foreign-born. At least one never graduated from high school, and another was only 32 years old when he joined the bench. For example, when President Eisenhower, a Republican, nominated Earl Warren for Chief Justice, Eisenhower expected him to make conservative decisions. Instead, he chose to appoint him to the Supreme Court. A US Supreme Court justice is expected to be, in the words of Irving R. Kaufman, "a paragon of virtue, an intellectual Titan, and an administrative wizard" This job is for life, barring resignation, retirement, or removal from the court by impeachment. Of the 112 justices who have held the position, not one has yet been removed from office as a result of an impeachment. One of their roles is to protect the fundamental rights of all Americans, even as different parties take power. to be debated and dissected by the ultimate judges, time and history. To be debated, dissected and debated, we need to look to the past, present and future. We need to see how far we have come and what we can learn from the past. We also need to learn from our mistakes and learn from each other. We want to be the best we can be, and we want to do it in a way that honors the past and the present. We hope you will join us in this quest.
