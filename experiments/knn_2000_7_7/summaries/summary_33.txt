John Guttag: The 60002 course is less about programming and more about dipping your toe into the exotic world of data science. The main topic of the course is what I think of as computational models. We'll talk about three kinds of models-- optimization, statistical models, and simulation. An optimization model is a very simple function that can help us to either understand something that has happened, or to build a model that explains phenomena we see every day. The final exam will be a final exam based upon all of the above.
