sample the signal in the time domain and then add a bunch of zeros to it before you Fourier transform. And that gives you finer samples in the frequency domain. And I'll show you in more detail how to do this after we talk about tapering. And it's very simple code actually. Matlab has built into it the ability to do zero-padding right in the FFT function. OK, let's actually just stop there. I feel like we covered a lot of stuff today. Last time, we covered Fourier series and the Fourier transform. Today, we're going to talk about the convolution theorem, noise and filtering Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem and spectral estimation. Next, we'll move on to spectrograms and an important idea of windowing and tapering, time bandwidth product, and some more advanced filtering methods. And we'll end with a look at a square wave that we've been talking about, the square wave is symmetric or even.
