Professor: The amygdala is closely connected to the basal forebrain. Professor: The abnormal brain connections that we know occur, at least many types of schizophrenia. He says the earlier the lesion, the greater the plasticity, the more chances of sprouting the connections that are the basis for this idea. In green, there are the very widespread catechol-oligosynaptic projections, which show the extent of the brain's plasticity. In blue, the acetylcholine containing neurons that you see in the medial septum, which we mentioned last time. that we know if you bind the receptor you'll reduce the effects of the [? rejections. ?] If the prefrontal cortex is functioning abnormally because of sprouting of these axons, also the basal forebrain, then binding to the receptors will move it more towards the normal. Just saying that it does [INAUDIBLE].. Let's talk about the other part of the basal ganglia, the larger part, the corpus striatum. Going back to these earlier pictures where I talked about the evolution, remember very early there was no dorsal Striatum. It was more of an olfactory structure.
