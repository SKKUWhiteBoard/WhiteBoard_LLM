Tamaso POGGIO: I think it's a golden age for intelligent applications. We are still very far from understanding how people can answer questions about images. This is one of the main focus in the center, really. How does your brain answer simple questions about this image? About what is there? And what is this? Who is this person? What is she doing? What's she thinking? Let me tell you a bit more about the background here. This idea of merging brain research and computer science in the quest to understand intelligence. looking at the face. And make models of what's going on. And, of course, we want these models to respect the neural data, ideally the MRI data. And do the job of recognizing faces as well as human do. So we are getting there. I'm not saying we have the answers, but we have at least models that can be tested at all these different levels. So that's kind of the ideal situation, from the point of view of what we want to do in the center.
