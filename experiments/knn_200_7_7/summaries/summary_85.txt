liyan blake a little bit about him he's kind of out there some of his contemporaries thought he was insane you know nowadays maybe he would be heavily medicated. People think that he's out there and there was that who was William Wordsworth who said that there is something in the madness of this man which interests me more than the sanity of Lord Byron and Walter Scott. These individuals Blake and will do Wordsworth later and Coolridge and all of these people these are answers on Jeopardy so when you're flipping through and you just stop because oh there's an English question. and your parents don't know just throw out William Blake you might be right okay very very famous individual so we'll be covering in the next couple days the lamb by William Blake. okay this is probably the sweetest of the poems that we have to some degree okay looking at it at face value one they have a little picture and these are the the etchings that he does okay you know with the picture that they give us to to help place things you know we have a shepherd talking to his flock okay he's out there alone he's probably has conversations with them. the field but somebody that is passionate about their religion and their faith you know the nature and the common man the shepherd person of the flock or even a child in a sense of children so it's a very short one and it's one that I believe is pretty easy to to comprehend and understand okay. "I believe it is one of the easiest to understand and understand," he says. "It's one of those things that is very, very easy to understand. It's very simple to understand"
