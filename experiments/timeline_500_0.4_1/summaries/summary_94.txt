then we are going to continue with the second part of the lecture today which focuses on the problem what actually happens if the gaussian assumption that i have about my constraints doesn't hold. As you will see in some small examples having this outliers in your optimization problem is something which hurts dramatically which actually screw up your solution. Already a few outliers can lead to a environment model which is completely unusable for doing any navigation task so where the geometry of what you computed doesn't fit to the real world geometry anymore and one of the questions actually how to handle that.
