In quantum mechanics, the spin of a particle with a vector is quantized, and in terms of its length and its components. You find that it's square root of f times s plus 1 in units of h-bar. The components, and along any axis, actually-- and in this case here, the d-axis-- have eigenvalues, and they are listed here. And we find that there is 2s plus 1 possible values, so I'll pick here, just arbitrarily, the z axis. physical state of particles, which axis are the right ones to choose-- or, sensible? There's no right and wrong in this discussion. Let me motivate this. If you look at the orbital momentum of a particle, that's given by r cross p, where p is the momentum vector of the particle. So now, if you're looking at the total momentum, we have to look add the angular momentum and the spin of the particles together. So this is a nice choice of coordinate system or of axis.
