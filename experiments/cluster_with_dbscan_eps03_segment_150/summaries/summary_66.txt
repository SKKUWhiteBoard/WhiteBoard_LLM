Professor: Today we're going to talk about partial differential equations. Professor Swan is going to do a review on Friday. Next time I'll be lecturing to you will be a week from Friday. The homework following the quiz will be posted and so you guys can get started on that. For example, if you wanted to solve the Schrodinger equation for h2 plus, it turns out there's a special coordinate system called the elliptic coordinate system. And in that coordinate system, the partial differential equation is separable.
