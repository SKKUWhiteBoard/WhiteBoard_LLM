As of June 2014, NEDCTP has deployed 802 of 985 canine teams for which it is able to fund across the transportation system. In January 2013, we reported that TSA collected and used key canine program data in its Canine Website System (CWS), a central management database. We found that TSA had not fully analyzed the performance data it collected in CWS to identify program trends and areas that were working well or in need of corrective action. Since our January 2013 report, TSA has taken steps to analyze key data on the performance of its canine teams. be found on the last page of this statement.
