Markus Klute: This class will be taught in an inverted classroom or flipped classroom setting. The course evaluation or your evaluation in this course will be made up 50% out of homework. The great divide-- the great divide or the grade divide-- at 85% between A and B, 70% between B and C, 60% between C and D, and below 50% earns you an F. The grading scheme will not be worse than what I've given you here, Klute says.
