The "Victoria" made the first circumnavigation of the globe in 1522. But this story really begins in 1494, two years after Columbus's voyage on behalf of Spain. Spain and Portugal, the two major seafaring super powers at the time, agreed to these terms in what came to be called the Treaty of Tordesillas. At the time the nations had their eyes on the same prize: trade routes to the Spice Islands in today's Indonesia. The spices found there were used as seasonings, food preservatives and aphrodisiacs. Ferdinand Magellan was captain of a Spanish armada on a voyage to the Spice Islands. The crew included a young slave named Enrique, captured by Magellan on a previous journey to Malacca. After 98 days at sea, dozens of sailors had succumbed to scurvy and famine. Enrique is believed to have plotted with the Rajah to have about 30 of the Spaniards killed at a feast on the beach. He may have been the first person to make it back toMalacca. actually circumnavigate the globe. Magellan's legacy lingers. He had galaxies and space programs named after him. The "Victoria" continued west, piloted by Juan Sebasti√°n Elcano, one of the pardoned mutineers. The small vessel made it back to Spain with a full cargo of cloves and cinnamon, enough to cover the expedition and turn a profit. An obsessive chronicler, Pigafetta described the lands and people they encountered. With the help of a humble slave, he also compiled the first phrase book of native languages.
