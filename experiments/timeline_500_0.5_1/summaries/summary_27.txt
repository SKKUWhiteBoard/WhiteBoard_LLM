James W. SWAN: I hope everybody saw the correction to a typo in homework 1 that was posted on Stellar last night and sent out to you. The TAs gave a hint that would have let you solve the problem as written. But that's more difficult than what we had intended for you guys. So maybe you'll see the distinction between those things and understand why one version of the problem is much easier than another. So we've got two lectures left discussing linear algebra before we move on to other topics. because you didn't do pivoting-- you'd like to do pivoted in order to minimize the numerical error. Or you need to reorder inorder to minimize fill-in. As an example, I've solved a research problem where there was something like 40 million equations and unknowns. If you reorder those equations, then you can solve via Gaussian elimination pretty readily. But if you don't, well-- my PC had-- I don't know-- like, 192 gigabytes of RAM. The elimination on that matrix will fill the memory of that PC up in 20 minutes. And you'll be stuck. model I showed you last time works. If the chip is in a particular cell, then at the next level, there's a 50/50 chance that I'll go to the left or I'll going to the right. So the probability that I'm in a certain cell at level i is this Pi. And there's some sparse matrix A which spreads that probability out. And we'll see the simulation that tells us how probable it is to find the Plinko chip. Yes?
