We're gonna have aggressive so with our regressive tax as people earn more income base they are attacked a smaller amount of smaller percentage of the rounding so here we see people paying a small person their income tax as their income goes up. With our progressive tax people pay the same percentage whether progressive its detect ops as progressive people pay lark there. We want to know do we tax people or to be tax household so let me show you an example because the units that were taxed and can have all kinds of different applications [Music] that's hot. Sales taxes are regressive because people are going to spend different amounts of their anymore. As we earn a dollar from it some amount of that dollar is going to be paid in tax but that percentage that you're paying tax changes. The difference here between 86 and 36 has been to thousands with $50,000 we've got 4,000 yes this guy is easy the decimal point four thousand five so 12,500 plus we're going to pay 18,000 submit an $85 your taxes on $90,000 and we can figure out what our average tax rate is. here don't beat 607 of those dollars so does that make people everyone agrees the answer is yes we just don't know what the number is it's probably different for different people. At one point in time Sweden had a marginal tax rate it was 102 percent so what does that that if you had $50,000 and then you earn $10,000 there is your went from 50,000 to 60,000 not only did they take all 10,000 what what they do they take more right. 17,000 Orlando will go to top Bill and Hillary will both oh eight thousand each so our total BAM attacks if we put this way 19,000 if we tax the household this goes back to this idea we discussed the horizontal language all right we want to treat people that are in similar circumstances. If we tax them as a family they're both a 20-3 if they're married and they're not they're paying 16,000 these people are paying 23,000 this is what you may have heard about this when your refund their tax that's called the marriage the tax code penalize you for being there. when we're looking at fiscal policy Keynes's and we can look at things wide changes and taxes or changes in government spending. When we look at the national debt that's just some eight of all these government debt assistants are possible just a doll and we saw for our country so we have all the deficits and surpluses that we packs and some of you maybe want to add all that up that adds up to 17 trillion dollars deficit in any given year. We can engage the fiscal policy that makes these guys change on purpose we can have called discretionary fiscal policy.
