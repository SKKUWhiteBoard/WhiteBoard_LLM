nice bit of experimental data, but we've discovered the energy is, in fact, not just independent of m, but it's independent of l, too. Why? What symmetry is explaining this extra degeneracy? We'll pick that up next time. Back to Mail Online home. back to the page you came from. Click here to read the rest of the article. Back To the pageyou came from, click here to reads the rest.

If you have a gradient of a magnetic field, then one end a dipole-- one end of your magnet-- can feel a stronger effective torque then the other guy. So, you can get a net force. And that force is going to be proportional to how big your magnet is. And if the force is proportional to the strength ofyour magnet, then how far-- if you send this magnet through a region, it'll get deflected in one direction or the other.
