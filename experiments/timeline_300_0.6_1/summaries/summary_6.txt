The chef test highlights the skills that everyone should possess if they want to learn to cook anything at any time and be confident that it'll always come out great. If you already have all seven of these skills and cooking techniques great you can work for me on the other hand if you only have one or two ofthese skills that's still fantastic. skill down when I can give someone three different oils types of oils put them in a pan and they can tell me where the variable smoke points are so you pass this test when the chef notices the oil starting to change from being perfectly smooth to beginning a convection process then adds the protein product to the pan just before there's visible smoke. Brown foods are attractive F Foods this is what attracts the eye and to develop golden color in the sauté pan you have to get the sugars in your product to caramelize at 320° fah. one that's lost moisture one that's burned one that shows the lack of involvement in the preliminary steps of the sauté process Chef test number four here's the answer thicken a liquid to make a sauce. Rue flour and cornstarch are fantastic thickening agents but you need to have an understanding of how much to use and this can only happen with controlling the process of gelatinization of starches Chef that can show me that they pass they take a cup of milk they turn it into a thickened sauce that's shiny that's velvety. control heat in a moist convective process is an important Chef's skill number six was to roast something delicate like fish. There's a very fine line between the coagulation of proteins the stiffening and shrinking of what you're cooking at 165° F and the 212° fah when moisture starts evaporating. The key to cooking with dry heat is being able to live in this temperature zone between 165 and 212 where the food Cooks for drying out so you pass the chef test if you give me a nice piece of flounder or tilapia even Cod or Whitefish catfish anything that's fully cooked and it retains its moisture without drying out. and it's dry it's much smaller in its uh cooked State than it was in its raw State because of the drying effect of the oven this Chef doesn't know how to retain moisture in a dry cooking process Chef test number seven how to tell when a grilled steak is done. If you can Master this you are a master griller most people just burn stuff you fail this test if you give me three St Stakes all cooked to the same temperature or if you can't tell which steak is rare medium well done if you're taking them off the grill guest atam the chef that can that can't control direct to Source conductive heat would create waste in my restaurant waste over sales for Stakes being sent back to the kitchen.
