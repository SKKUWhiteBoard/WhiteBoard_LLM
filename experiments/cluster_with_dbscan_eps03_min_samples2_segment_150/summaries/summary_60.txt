G, 1 over the degree of v plus 1. So let us prove this theorem first, and then we'll see an application and some ways to interpret this result. The proof of this theorem applies the probabilistic method. So we are given this graph G. And the first thing we'll do is order the vertices of G uniformly at random. So the edges are 1 to 2, 2 to 4, 3 to 4 and 1 to 3. What because one of them would appear before the other in the order, and that would violate the condition. Turan's theorem is a foundational result in graph theory. It says that every n-vertex. graph G contains a clique on at least this many vertices. So here's the example. Let us take the n vertices and split them into equal parts. And there are r parts, so here in this illustration r equals to 3. And let's put in all the edges between parts, but no edge within a part. So this is called the complete r partite graph. minus 1 minus 1 over r times n. And this quantity here equals to r. So there's a strict equality sign here. In particular, G has a clique of size strictly greater than r, and that finishes the proof of Turan's theorem. Turanâ€™s theorem is a important and foundational result in graph theory. And it's a start of a subject that we now call extremal graph theory, concerning what can you say about a graph that has certain properties, like not having a large clique? An independent set in a graph is a subset of vertices with no two adjacent. For example, if the graph is this cycle on four vertices, an example of an independent set would be two vertices like this. So an important question in graph theory is given a graph, what can you say about the size of its independent sets? The following theorem, due to Caro-Wei, says that every graph G contains a large independent set of size at least the following quantity.
