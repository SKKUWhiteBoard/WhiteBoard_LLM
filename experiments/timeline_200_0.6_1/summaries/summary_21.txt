Simple graphs are directed graphs where the arrows have a beginning and an end. A directed graph might have a self loop, an edge that starts and begins at the-- starts and ends at the same vertices. A simple graph has a nonempty set, v of vertices, and it has a set E of edges, but the edges now are somewhat different since they don't have beginnings and ends. An edge just has two endpoints that are in V, and we don't distinguish the endpoints. There have been repeated studies that are cited in the notes that show again and again that when they survey collections of men and women and ask them how many sexual partners they have, it's consistently the case that the men are assessed to have 30% more, 75% more. We're going to come up with a very elementary graph theoretic argument that says that this is complete nonsense. The most recent study that we could find was one that's mentioned in 2007 by the US Department of Health. And the statistician who collected the data knew that the results were impossible. David Frum: We can use a simple graph structure to represent who got together with whom in any given population of men and women. He says there's a fixed relationship between the average number of partners of men, the average degree of the M vertices and the average degrees of the F vertices. Frum says this has nothing to do with behavior, or promiscuity, or lack of it. It's simply a reflection of the ratio of the populations, he says, and people are lying.
