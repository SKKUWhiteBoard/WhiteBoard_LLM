Mathematically, a consumer is trying to maximize his utility. And this utility maximization has to be done with respect to some constraint and the constraint the budget constraint we take P 1 x 1; P 2 x 2 should be less than or equal to I. In real life, it is possible that a person derives some satisfaction from having some money left in his pocket, but the way this problem has been framed here the personâ€™s satisfaction depends only on his level of consumption of good 1, and good 2. Student: What we have here is such that P 1 x 1 plus P 2 x 2 is equal to I. Student: Downward sloping, slope is again going to be equal to minus P 1 by P 2 here also is slope is minus P1 by P2 ok. And similarly, we can draw for different. values of K and this is the optimal bundle, this is. the bundle; let us say x star and here is let us call it also x star in the old problem just to distinguish x star. in the new problem.
