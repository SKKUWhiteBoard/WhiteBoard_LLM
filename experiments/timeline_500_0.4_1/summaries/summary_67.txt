So in the next portion of today's lecture we're going to talk about how we can modify the policy gradient calculation to reduce its variance. In this way we'll obtain a version of the policy gradients that can be used as a practical reinforcement learning algorithm. The first trick that we'll start with is going to exploit a property that is always true in our universe which is causality causality says that the policy at time t prime can't affect the reward at another time step t if t is less than t prime.
