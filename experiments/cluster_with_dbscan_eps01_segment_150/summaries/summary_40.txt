shielding arguments are capable of explaining that. OK, so this is the end of atoms. And I've asked you to observe some complicated algebra which you're never going to do. Everything you need to know about atoms, you can tell a computer, and it can do it. Now molecules are much more complicated. And that's we're going to start on next time. We'll start with molecular orbital theory. I'm not going to be presenting the normal textbook approach. I'll present an interpretive approach, where you understand why things happen. The goal of this course is to give you the tools to interpret complicated phenomena. We have electronic structure and the hydrogen atom as a way of understanding what electronic structure is. When we go to molecular orbital theory, we take what we know about atoms, and build a minimally-complex interpretive picture, which is sort of a framework for understanding complicated molecular interactions. The relationship between the effective quantum number and the ionization energy of a state then provides a hydrogen-atom-based structural model for everything you can observe.
