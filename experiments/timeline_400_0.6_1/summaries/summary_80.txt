Professor: angular momentum is a set of operators that provide observables, things we can measure. He says they're particularly important for systems in which you have central potentials. Professor: If you have two energy for every system except for every energy except for 0, you have a problem. You know the problem, if you can uniquely characterize the states of the system, then you can learn more about the physics of this state, he says, and you can also know more about physics of a circle.
