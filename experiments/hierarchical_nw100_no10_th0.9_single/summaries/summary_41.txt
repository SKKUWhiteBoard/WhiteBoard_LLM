Section 1098 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) tasked GAO with reviewing the process for distributing highway. Act provided unprecedented authorization of $122 billion for highways, bridges, and related activities for fiscal years 1992-97. Funding funded primarily through federal highway user taxes such as those on motor fuels (gasoline, gasohol, and diesel), tires, and trucks. Funds from these sources are collected from users and credited to the Highway Trust Fund for highway and mass transit projects.
