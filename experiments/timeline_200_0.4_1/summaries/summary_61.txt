The size of the ribosome is similar to the size of a rhinovirus. The mature transcript is resistant to exonucleases. The poly-adenine tail of the transcript is structural to protect the ends of that transcript. The transfer RNAs and theribosomes are the molecular players in translation. They play a key role in translation and give you much more proteins than one gene can encode, which is a wonderful way to diversify transcripts and give them different functions. The genetic code, which forms the basis of this entire concept, has some features to it where it does have some degeneracy. But we'll go through the degeneracy, and we'll take a look at the genetic code because it will tell us exactly how the three letter-- the words made of three bases encode everything we need for translation. The ribosomes were discovered a decade later, and that was the work that was awarded a Nobel Prize for. And then, later on, things started to get to the point where you know, these are sort of things you want to get out to. The genetic code gives you the identities of what are known as the codons, which is how we designate the triplet of nucleotides. The way you read this table is you read the first letter. So, if I'm going here, here, it's going to be starting UU. And then, within each block, there are the four alternatives for the other four bases. The third one, basically, just designates those. It is the absolute-- the sort of Rosetta Stone for translating messenger RNA to amino acid sequence using codons. "I think this field is fascinating. Once you get used to the mechanics of it, it's really cool to think of how you go from DNA to RNA to folded proteins," he says. "Don't forget my office hours on Monday if you need them," he adds. "I'll be in the lab all day, every day, if you want to talk to me about it." "I've got a lot of questions for you," she says, "but I'll be happy to answer them."
