The probability of heads is p. It would be biased in favor of heads if p is greater than 1/2. And we want to know how many heads are expected. This is a basic question that will come up again and again when we look at random variables and probability theory. And our strategy is going to be to use the binomial theorem, and then the trick of differentiating it isgoing to wind up giving us the expected number of heads in n coin flips. It starts to look like something a little bit familiar. us a closed formula for this expression for the expectation of the binomial random variable. The binomial theorem says that the nth power of x plus y is the sum all from k equals 0 to n of n of k times n choose k, x to the k, y to the n minus k. So what I'm going to do is replace p and q-- replace x and y in this general formula. And what happens? So I just plug in the p andq. Now, the left hand side is going to become n.
