Time dilation is a change in the light frequency. If there is a time dilation effect due to gravitational fields, then there's also a redshift which is of gravitational fields. The way to think about this is first to say, OK, now the light-- the delta t equals the light to travel-- is l divided by c. The change in velocity is g, acceleration. So the Doppler shift then is c divided by l, which is the speed of light. And I would like you to get a feeling. How big can this effect be, the effect of redshift here? the frequency, the new frequency, divided by the initial frequency. And that can be approximated by 1 plus delta v over c. So we find that it's 1 plus g times l over c square. Now the speed of light is pretty fast, 3 times 10 to the 9 meter per second. And this distance is only 22 and 1/2 meters. But nevertheless, experimentalists at Harvard tested this effect. So Pound, Rebka, and Snider in the 1950s and '60s were able to show this very tiny effect.
