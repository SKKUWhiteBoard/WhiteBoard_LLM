In this problem, we're going to be dealing with a variation of the usual coin-flipping problem. But in this case, the bias itself of the coin is going toBe random. And we're told that the expectation of this bias is some mu and that the variance of the bias isSome sigma squared. And what we'll be asked is find a bunch of different expectations, covariances, and variances. We'll see that this problem gives us some good exercise in a few concepts, a lot of iterated expectations. Expectation of xi given Q, we already argued earlier here that it should just be Q. And then the same thing for xj. That should also be Q, so this is just expectation of Q squared minus mu squared. All right, well, how can we simplify this inner-conditional expectation? Well, we can use the fact that the problem tells us that, conditioned on Q, the tosses are independent. So this is, in fact, exactly equal to the variance of Q. we're told is sigma squared. All right, so what we found is that for i not equal to j, the coherence of xi and xj is exactly equal to s Sigma squared. So what does that tell us? That tells us that these two random variables are correlated. And so, because they're correlated, they can't be independent. And the answer that we wanted was that in fact, xi, xj are in fact not independent. Right. So now let's move on to the last part, part C, which asks us to calculate the variance of x. not equal to j, we also calculated in part B. That's just sigma squared. All right, and now if we compare these two, we'll see that they are proportionally exactly the same. So what do we learn from this problem? Well, we saw that first of all, it's very useful to use law of iterated expectations. But the trick is to figure out what you should condition on. And that's kind of an art that you learn through more practice.
