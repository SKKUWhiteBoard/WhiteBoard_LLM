So let me say here just the repetition, normal, inferior. Let us say we are talking about price of good 1 has gone up substitution, income these are the effects and overall. When P 1 goes up subs because of substitution effect x 1 will. Come down. And for income also because of income effect it will come down. So, overall it comes down. While inferior goods substitution effect quantity demanded would come down while income effect is Up. Up. Can you give me an example its very very difficult to find Giffen good in real life why? Sir, like if Gucci is a brand and it is. Prices comes down by significant amount. No one could buy a Gucci, it is at that level. Only because of it is prices. I am not certain about this statement then when price of these goods would come down then people would not buy. That is not true. So, these luxury goods are not Giffen goods fine, it is clear? Let me give you just an example typically it is very very difficult to find Giffsen goods. You know if you take an example of potato that I gave you earlier and it was it was talked about for a very long time in economic discipline that during Irish famine the potato was Giffan good.
