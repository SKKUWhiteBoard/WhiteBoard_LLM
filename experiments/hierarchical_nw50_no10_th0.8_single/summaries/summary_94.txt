Most residential users dial in to an ISP over a telephone line. Small business users may also connect to a backbone network through an ISP. Large businesses often purchase dedicated lines that connect directly to large businesses. Backbone providers have points of presence in varied locations.

The treatment of these more established communications services and infrastructures under the Communications Act of 1934—as amended by the 1996 act—has indirectly affected the burgeoning Internet medium.
