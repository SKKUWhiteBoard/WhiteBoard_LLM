angular momentum is a set of operators that provide observables, things we can measure. We showed that any component of angular momentum, be it lx, ly, or lz, commutes with l squared. For the l squared operator, we also explained that the eigenvalue of this operator should be positive. We figured out by looking at this differential equation that if we wanted single valued wave functions-- wave functions would be the same at phi, and at Phi plus 2 pi. an equation for what were eventually called Legenre polynomials. The answer is that if you have a system you want to figure out what are the properties of the states. If you can also know the angular momentum you learn more about the physics of this state. So in general, it's a most important question to try to enlarge the set of commuting observables. Leading finally to what is initially called a complete set of commutative observables, or commutators. and an electron we can reduce this system to as if we had one particle in a central potential. So that will be also very important physically. And here there is a simple observation that one can make. Is that the differential equation for p l m depends on m squared. We expect to need values of m that are positive and negative. The complex conjugate ones should be thought as having m negative. So how did people figure this out? They, in fact, figured out that if you have these polynomials you can create automatically the solutions for this equation. In general when we choose a general l, if you choose an arbitrary l, then m goes from minus l, minus l plus 1 all the way up to l. If you choose state with l equals 1, or eigenfunctions with l equal 1, there is the possibility of having m equals minus 1, 0, or 1. The spherical harmonicas are going to be those wave functions. And they have a normalization, n l m, an exponention, and all that.
