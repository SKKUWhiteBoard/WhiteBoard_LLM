Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, AKA Lenin, helped overthrow the Russian tsar Nicholas II in 1917. He founded the Soviet Union, one of the worst dictatorships of the 20th century. But was he a hero who toppled an oppressive tyranny or a villain who replaced it with another? It's time to put Lenin on the stand in History vs. Lenin, says Alexander Nekrassov, the author of the novel "The Death and Life of Vladimir Lenin" how would I have sounded?" We can never be sure how things could've unfolded if different people were in power or different decisions were made, but to avoid the mistakes of the past, we must always be willing to put historical figures on trial. We must never forget that history is not an exact copy of the present, but it can be a guide to the future. It can be used to learn from the mistakes made in the past and to make better decisions in the present. It is never too late to put a historical figure on trial for their actions.
