the Lord Byron George Gordon Lord Byron very interesting very outgoing very flamboyant personality he stood out. He was an individual that you know probably was a bit of a celebrity to some degree he had the money he was wanting it. He had a lot of love affairs going on he kind of ran out his welcome and all of a sudden he becomes a literary relevance so people actually think wow you actually contribute something instead of you're famous for being famous kind of like some people we might be able to mention. coming in and the sound will be identical in conclusion at the very end he comes back from talking about all of the size in his love for nature and sums it back that you know and I have loved the ocean so just in case you forgot throughout these short two pages to whom he was speaking or addressing we see once again that it is nature and don't forget what an apostrophe is okay remember I told you when we learned it that's hey you're going to need to remember this and people tend to forget for some strange reason. "Heath Ledger was a bold person he was rebellious you know in nature and such and you know he had a you know kind of a tragic end there" "He was a very bold and very dangerous individual okay if you look in the right-hand page and I want you to read this page when you have time" "A lot of times when the tragedy is somebody who is young and had some sort of accomplishments" "You know we're brilliant at whatever they did but you know they they died young"
