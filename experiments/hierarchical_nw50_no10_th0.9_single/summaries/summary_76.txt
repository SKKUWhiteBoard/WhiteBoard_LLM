On December 10, 2013, more than two years after the statutorily mandated deadline, five federal financial regulators published final regulations. The Volcker Rule is designed to prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in risky, short-term, speculative trading and investing in private equity and hedge funds. These are practices long condemned by the Rule's namesake, former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker. The same day that the regulations were issued, the Federal Reserve Board set the date when conformance with the Rule is required as July 21, 2015.
