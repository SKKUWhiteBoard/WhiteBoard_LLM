Since 2007, the Federal Highway Administration has amended certain national standards for traffic signs. Among the new standards were a measurable standard for the minimum level of nighttime visibility of traffic signs and a change in the lettering of street signs. This report provides background for the nighttime visibility maintenance standard and addresses some of the issues that have been raised about this standard. The reflective properties of sign materials decrease over time, due to exposure to sunlight and other factors. As the reflective materials degrade, a sign becomes harder to see at night.
