RAFAEL JARAMILLO: Today we're going to discuss the many D's of thermodynamics. We'll talk about lowercase d, lowercase Greek d, and uppercase Greek D. He'll draw a 3D visualization of how the entropy for a given phase might vary with pressure and temperature at a fixed composition. Jaramillo: The most common transformations that we talk about are transformations that take place at constant pressure and constant temperature, isobaric and isothermal transformations.
