MRAPs generally incorporate a "V"-shaped hull and armor plating designed to provide protection against mines and IEDs. Army and Marines first employed MRAPs in limited numbers in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2003, primarily for route clearance and explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) operations. As of July 21, 2011, 14,749 MR APs had been delivered to Afghanistan, including 6,980 M-ATVs. DOD officials have indicated that this requirement may increase Afghanistan.
