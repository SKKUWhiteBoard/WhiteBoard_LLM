Summary:
In 1995, over 9,000 foreign physicians with J-1 visas were in the United States for graduate medical education or training. These exchange visitors constituted about one-tenth of all individuals receiving medical education. Each year a few thousand new physicians receive J- 1 visas and enter the U.S. for medical education and training. For more information, visit the USIA website or go to www.usia.gov/j-1-visas or call 1-800-273-8255 or visit http://www.usIA.gov/. Congress has imposed restrictions on J-1 visa holders, including physicians in graduate medical education. These physicians are required to return to their home country (or to their country of last legal residence) for at least 2 years after completion of training. However, they may obtain a waiver of this requirement and remain in the United States. For most physicians, the waivers are requested on the request of the physician's home country or country of first legal residence. The waiver process can take up to two years. their behalf by a federal agency or by a state agency or department that is responsible for public health issues. These federal agencies and states generally request waivers of the 2-year foreign residence requirement so that the physicians can practice for several years in underserved areas. USIA reviews the program, policy, and foreign relations aspects of the case and forwards its recommendations to the INS Commissioner. For waiver requests made by interested U.S. government agencies or states, INS may only grant the waiver if USIA submits a waiver request. HHS endorses the philosophy that exchange visitors return home after completing their training to make their new knowledge and skills available to their home countries. HHS does not support waivers for physicians to remain in the United States to practice in underserved areas. Instead, HHS administers other federal programs, such as NHSC, to address physician shortages in the U.S. NHSC supplies physicians and other health professionals to underserved area.favorable recommendation. HHS is the federal agency responsible for addressing physician shortages it does not use waivers to do so. primarily by awarding scholarships to students who agree to serve in a shortage area after their health professions training is complete. On December 31, 1995, 848 NHSC physicians and 685 other NHSC professionals who received scholarships or federal loan repayment were practicing in underserved areas of the country. In addition to NHSC, HHS has other programs to address medical underservice. For example, HHS provides federal grant funding to community health centers that are required to accept all patients regardless of gender. The number of physicians receiving waivers of the 2-year foreign residence requirement for J-1 exchange visitors has grown more than tenfold in the past 5 years. Several factors have contributed to the increase: more hospitals and other facilities have found the waiver to be a means to fill their empty positions; more agencies and states are making requests; and physicians are actively seeking waivers. Waiver physicians are practicing in virtually every state; most are primary care physicians. Some are allegedly paying recruiters and immigration attorneys to find them a position. The number of waivers being processed for physicians to practice in underserved areas each year has grown from 70 in 1990, to 1,374 in 1995. Indications are that in 1995, about half of the foreign physicians that were supposed to return home were granted waivers of this requirement. The waivers were enough to offset about 27 percent of the total physician shortage identified by HHS, according to the HHS report. The number of NHSC physicians (1,267) practicing inunderserved areas in 1995 was greater than the number of foreign physicians practicing in the U.S. By 1995, four U.S. government agencies and 23 states were requesting waivers of J-1 visa requirements for physicians. The rapid growth in waivers began in late 1993 and 1994. The number of waivers also increased because the authority for states to request waivers was passed in 1994. Some facility officials and physicians reported paying up to $25,000 in immigration attorney or recruiter fees for assistance in matching a physician with a facility and processing the waiver. In addition to ARC, since 1993 the Department of Transportation has requested waivers for a handful of physicians. In 1996, waiver physicians were practicing in 49 states and the District of Columbia. The degree to which they are relied on to relieve physician shortages varies greatly from state to state. No single entity is responsible for coordinating practice locations of waiver physicians. Policies vary with regard to such matters as eligible practice locations and state involvement and the consequences of failure to complete the agreed-upon service length of a J-1 visa. The Department of Health and Human Services does not view waivers as a mechanism to help resolve the problems of shortage areas. HHS waivers are not well-coordinated, authors say. This means that federal agencies and states may not know of problems identified by HHS. Coordination between agencies involved in the requests and other programs is important. Authors: Weak controls mean there is little to deter physicians or their employers from failing to comply if they choose to break the terms of their agreement. They say many of these physicians have been at their jobs for a relatively short time, in many cases for less than 1 year. coordinated with other federal programs. Designating leadership responsibility for managing the program. Establishing penalties against facilities that fail to comply with requirements of the waiver. Directing the entity(ies) managing program to implement procedures and criteria for the selection and placement of physicians and for monitoring compliance with waiver requirements. For example, requiring the state to clearly support the use of the physician for the purposes of this waiver.

We provided a draft copy of this report to seven agencies that are involved with waivers for physicians to practice in underserved areas. ARC, USDA, and USIA provided formal written comments (see apps. VIII, IX, and X) These comments indicate general agreement with our conclusions and matters for congressional consideration. HUD and Justice chose not to provide formal comments. However, we discussed our findings with HUD and INS officials, and they raised no objections to our findings or matters. HHS did not submit formal comments by the end of our 30-day comment period. DOT has had limited involvement in waivers for physicians with J-1 visas and did not have comments on the draft report. The Director of the department’s Office of International Affairs (who also chairs the department's Exchange Visitor Waiver Review Board) said that HHS favored the option of delegating responsibility for the waivers to the states. For congressional consideration, he said, HHS favors delegating the waivers. three agencies that provided formal written comments also expressed their support for the need for better coordination between the participating agencies, states, and other programs to address medical underservice. One agency, USDA, also expressed concern about the lack of available funding to operate its program effectively. USDA suggested that an alternative to funding the program from appropriated research funds would be to initiate a fee-for-service type application fee to offset operational costs, which would require legislation to authorize the collection and utilizations of fees. for oversight and operational support to ensure that the physicians address unmet needs for physician resources. We did not examine financing options for managing the waivers in our review. A few states, such as Michigan, have been requiring user fees of up to $500 per application. We also received comments on technical matters from several of the agencies, which we considered in preparing our final report. We are sending copies of this report to the Secretaries of Agriculture, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, and Transportation. United States Information Agency, the Federal Co-Chairman of the Appalachian Regional Commission, and the Attorney General. We also will make copies available to others on request. Please contact me on (202) 512-7119 if you or your staff have any questions. Major contributors to this report are listed in appendix XI. To accomplish our objectives, we interviewed (1) federal agency officials responsible for requesting the waivers at ARC, HUD, USDA, and DOT; (2) HHS officials in the department’s Office of International Affairs and the Health Resources and Services Administration; and (3) officials at USIA and INS. including INS service centers; (4) officials from the Department of Labor and the State Department. We also reviewed relevant legislation, studies, and policy documents. We conducted two mail surveys: one of the states regarding the use of waivers of the J-1 visa foreign residence requirement for physicians in their states, and another of the facilities that requested such waivers for physicians. We concluded that the waiver of the requirement for doctors to live and work in the U.S. should be considered a non-discriminatory practice. obtained and analyzed data on requests for waivers for physicians from USIA and the requesting federal agencies. We also visited three states—Washington, Texas, and Georgia. During our site visits, we met with state and other health officials, visited 14 sites where waiver physicians were practicing, and interviewed health care facility officials and 20 physicians who received waivers. We conducted our work between November 1995 and September 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We used the date that the agencies sent the request to USIA in our calculations. computer-based systems, we did review the requesting agencies’ data for consistency and accuracy and selectively compared the agency data with that held by USIA. We obtained information on the waiver requests made by DOT from its Office of the General Counsel. Our scope did not include waiver requests from VA or requests from other agencies for physicians to conduct research. Because the agencies requesting waivers do not consistently track the practice dates of the physicians, we don’t know the exact date of each waiver request. could not identify the number of physicians in practice at any given point in time. Instead, we used the dates that the agencies and states submitted their requests for waivers to USIA. We assumed that those physicians whose waivers were requested in 1994 or 1995 were either already practicing at the facility listed in agency data on December 31, 1995, or had their waivers in process to begin practicing shortly thereafter. We compared this number with (1) the number. of physicians needed to remove the primary care Health Professional Shortage Area designations in the state on December. We obtained data from HHS’ Health Resources and Services Administration. We compared waivers with the number of NHSC physicians practicing in underserved areas on September 30, 1995. We also compared waivers to those who did not have NHSC scholarship or federal loan repayment obligations. We estimated the number who completed graduate medical education and training in 1995 who would be subject to the 2-year foreign residence. We used this data to estimate the number. of physicians who completed Graduate Medical Education and Training (GME) in 1995. requirement, we subtracted the number of exchange visitor physicians who were continuing applicants in the 1995-96 academic year from the number. physicians sponsored by ECFMG in the prior academic year. While this number is not exact because it may include a small number of physicians. who were involved in research and some physicians who did not complete their training, it does represent a reasonable estimate of the number with J-1 visas who completed graduate medical education or training who would be required to return home without a waiver. number of waiver requests for physicians to practice in underserved areas that the agencies sent to USIA in 1995 (1,374) is about 64 percent of this figure. To identify characteristics of the physicians who received waivers of the J-1 visa foreign residence requirement, we selected a random sample of 40 from 355 physicians for whom ARC requested waivers between 1990 and 1992. To determine conditions attached to the waivers, we interviewed state and federal agency officials, reviewed their written waiver policies, and analyzed the results of our state survey. Section 212(e) of the Immigration and Nationality Act requires that certain J-1 visa program participants, including participants in graduate medical education, reside at least 2 years in the countries of their nationalities or last residences after leaving the United States. They must meet this requirement before they are eligible to apply for nonimmigrant visas. There was no 2-year foreign residence requirement or waiver provision in the exchange visitor program authorized with the passage of the U.S. immigration reform act in 1996. The 2-year foreign residence requirement and its related waiver provision evolved through a number of legislative changes after the exchange visitor program was authorized in 1948. “The exchange program is not an immigration program and should not be used to circumvent the operation of the immigration laws,” a 1956 amendment to the act said. The act required participants to depart the United States after completing their programs. The 1956 amendment also provided for a waiver of the foreign residence requirements on the basis of a request from a foreign national. an interested U.S. government agency showing the waiver to be in the public interest. “To make available the services of exchangees who possess talents desired by our universities, foundations and other institutions, the language of the House bill was modified to permit the waiver of the foreign residence requirement on the request of an interested government agency,” the bill says. An amendment to the foreign residency provision in 1970 removed the blanket application of theforeign residence requirement for exchange visitors and imposed it only on participants whose participation was financed in some way by the United States. countries or (2) whose home countries clearly needed their services. Participants could no longer meet the 2-year foreign residence requirement by residing in other foreign countries but had to reside in the countries of their nationalities or their last foreign residences before coming to the United States. The 1970 act also established two additional bases for waivers: persecution because of race, religion, or political opinion and statements by the participant’s home countries that they had no objections to the waivers. These bases still apply except the statement of no-objection waiver is no longer available. to participants in graduate medical education or training. “that there is no longer an insufficient number of physicians and surgeons in the United States.” In light of this finding, the Congress tightened immigration laws for foreign doctors and strengthened requirements affecting J-1 visa program participants. The latter were made subject to the 2-year foreign residence requirement whether or not their programs were based in the U.S. or in a foreign country. It was not clear whether the new requirements would apply to foreign-born medical students. In 1981, USIA asked the Congress to extend the limit up to 7 years for medical doctors to encourage them to study in the United States. The House Committee on the Judiciary questioned USIA officials regarding the likelihood that physicians would be willing to return home after 7 years. The Congress increased the usual permissible duration of stay to7 years, but it imposed additional requirements. Graduate medical education or training participants were required, as a continuing reminder, to furnish annual affidavits to INS attesting that they would return to their home countries. Up to 20 waivers for physicians with J-1 visas may be granted at the request of a statedepartment of public health or its equivalent each fiscal year. Amendment of the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1994 established another basis for physicians to obtain waivers. U.S. officials were required to issue an annual report to the Congress on participants who had submitted affidavits, including their names and addresses, the programs in which they are participating, and their status in the programs. The amendments apply only to exchange visitors who were admitted to the United States under a J-visa or acquired such status before June 1, 1996.

We used the number of full-time-equivalent physicians identified by HHS as needed to remove primary care Health Professional Shortage Area designations. Although physicians with waivers may also practice in designated Medically Underserved Areas, HHS does not remove this designation and, as a result, there is no dedesignation level to measure the need for physicians in the MedicallyUnderserved Area. To measure need, we used the primary measurement used by HHS and the requesting agencies to establish the need. the number of waiver physicians who would be practicing on December 31, 1995, or shortly thereafter. We used data from the requesting agencies and states on the number of waived applications sent to USIA from 1994 to 1995. The number of NHSC physicians in a state was used to determine the total number of physicians practicing in that state. This is a conservative number because it does not include the number. of physicians who were NHSC state loan repayment recipients practicing in shortage areas, which was not available by state. from NHSC at the time of our review. As shown in table VII.1, the degree to which the identified physician shortage can be offset by the waiver physicians practicing in a state varied between the states. When combined with the NHSC physicians practicing there, the number exceeded the number of physicians needed to remove some states’ primary care Health Professional Shortage Area designations. OtherStates’ identified physician needs were not met by these two physician sources. In addition to those named above, the following individuals made important contributions.

Summary:
TPPs prepare teaching candidates to employ effective teaching techniques and gain real-world experience in the classroom. TPPs take many forms and may be operated by a variety of organizations (see table 1) State oversight responsibilities related to TPPs may be held by one or more state agencies, including the state department of education, the state board of Education, or a state agency. For example, the structure of TPPs can vary widely, from “traditional” TPPs such as four-year undergraduate programs with student teaching requirements, to “alternative route’ TPPs. state independent standards board. States have discretion in how they conduct oversight of TPP quality. States can define the types of TPPs that may operate in the state, such as undergraduate or post-baccalaureate TPPs, or alternative route TPPs. They can also set licensing requirements that teaching candidates must satisfy that often include completing an approved TPP and passing licensing tests that assess subject-matter knowledge or other other criteria. State can also assess whether any TPPs are low-performing, as required under the Higher Education Act.  states are now using or developing academic standards that are explicitly tied to college and career preparation. In 2010, the Council of Chief State School Officers and the National Governors Association spearheaded the effort to help states develop common college- and career-ready standards for grades K-12 in math and English. As of the beginning of the 2014-15 academic year, 44 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the Common Core State Standards. The Common Core Standards will be rolled out to all states by the end of the year. the District of Columbia were using the Common Core Standards that were developed and published in 2010. The remaining states were using or developing their own college- and career-ready standards. Education does not have direct oversight authority over TPPs.main ways it influences the quality of TPPs are (1) implementing the Higher Education Act Title II reporting requirements and (2) awarding and administering several competitive grants. Title II requires states and institutions of higher education that conduct TPPs to annually report specific information. colleges or universities that offer TPPs submit the required data using reporting templates developed by Education (see table 2). In this report we use the term “college or university” to mean “institution of higher education” as defined by the act. This table presents a summary of the templates developed for reporting purposes. It is not intended to provide an exhaustive list of the Higher Education Act Title II reporting requirements. For the statutory reporting requirements, see 20 U.S.C. §§ 1022d-1022f. colleges and universities offering TPPs provide the required information. The agency also compiles and disseminates the information to the public in annual reports, webpages and data spreadsheets. The proposed rule was available for Title II reporting requirements through February 2, 2015. On December 2, 2014, Education published a notice of proposed rulemaking, which among other things, proposed to modify the proposed rule. As part of this announcement, the Department of Education is releasing a list of proposed changes to the rules. Education administers several competitive grant programs that provide funding for TPP reforms. Of these competitive grants, the largest that is focused specifically on improving TPP quality is the Teacher Quality Partnership Grant program. In September 2014, Education selected 24 partnerships, including TPPs and partnering school districts, to receive a combined $35 million in grant funds. The grants are intended to improve teacher preparation primarily for science, technology, engineering, and math teachers. The Transition to Teaching grant program also provides grants to recruit and retain teachers. Teachers in high-need schools and encourage the development and expansion of alternative route TPPs. All states reported that they review traditional TPPs before approving them to prepare new teachers and may renew approval. For example, Investing in Innovation grants funded 25 projects related to TPPs out of the 143 projects the program has funded during fiscal years 2010-2014. For more information on the Race to the Top Fund and the Supporting Effective Educator Development program, go to: http://www.racetothetopfund.org/ and http:// www.supportingeffectiveeducatordevelopment.org. on a periodic basis. Nearly all states reported that they review TPP program design and data about candidates before approving them to prepare new teachers. More than half also use one or more types of information to assess graduates’ effectiveness as teachers. To assess program design, 49 states and the District of Columbia reported in our survey that they assess whether TPPs seeking approval are meeting standards for program quality.specify that teaching candidates should be trained to identify the. For example, these standards may appropriate teaching techniques for particular learning needs or achieve a particular threshold. Nearly all states reported in our survey that they examine data about teaching candidates. More than half of states reported that they also review certain information about graduate effectiveness when assessing TPPs for approval or renewal. States reported using data about the proportion of candidates who obtain a teaching license (48 states) as part of their approval process for all traditional TPPs (see fig. 1). These results are based on our survey of all 50 states and the District of Columbia. See the related e-supplement, GAO-15-599SP, for the original language. procedures are sufficient to ensure quality without having a process to identify low-performing TPPs. For example, officials in 2 of the 7 states that reported they do not have a process for identifying low- performing programs in our survey told us that it was not necessary. While it is possible that all TPPs are meeting states’ performance criteria and do not merit a low-performance designation, states are still required to have such a process in place, the report says. For more information on the report, go to: http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/29/health/healthcare/top-10-health-care-policies-and-reforms-in-the-united-states. Officials from two other states told us that they are developing or planning to develop a new process for identifying low- performing TPPs. Education does not verify whether states use the process they describe in their Title II reports to identify low-performing programs or ensure that all states have such a process. According to Standards for Education, states can choose to change their process from time to time, but they are expected to use the previous process until the new one is implemented. To see the full report, go to CNN.com/Education. Under the Higher Education Act, Education has responsibility for ensuring the quality of the data submitted in Title II reports. State officials are expected to certify the accuracy of the Title II data they submit to Education and Education reviews the state reports for obvious instances of non- compliance. Agency officials were not aware that two states did not describe a process to identify low-performing programs in their most recent Title II report. The Education Department says it has no plans to change the way Title II is administered in the future. Education officials also said that Education does not verify that states are in fact implementing the procedures they describe in their Title II reports. All seven states that reported in our survey that they did not have a process for identifying low-performing TPPs described a process to Education in the Without a monitoring Title II report that was reported in October, 2014, Education may miss instances of noncompliance. Reports. If states are failing to comply with the federal requirement to conduct an assessment to identify low- performing TPPs. The majority of states (43) reported to us that they had a process for identifying low-performing TPPs. The most common criteria they used to identify low- performing TPPs were failure to meet the state’s TPP or teaching standards and denial or conditional approval during the state approval or renewal process. According to data that states submitted as part of their Title II report, 6 states identified one or more TPPs as low-performance and 13 states identified a TPP as at risk of becoming low performing in 2013 or 2014. TPPs of their status. Most also publicized this status (4) and increased their monitoring of the TPPs (5) Two of the six states that identified low-performing programs also identified programs at risk of becoming low- performing. As states shifted to new K-12 standards, most reported taking steps to help TPPs prepare prospective teachers to teach lessons aligned with the new standards. 37 states reported in our survey that they provided TPPs with information on the standards to help them understand the standards. The U.S. Department of Education, At-Risk and Low- Performing Programs by State for 2013 and 2014, in the Title II Data Tools. TPPs with written resources, information sessions, or both. One state convened a half-day workshop that included information about the new standards. Officials then posted a recording of the session and additional resources about the standards online. Three states reported inviting TPPs to K-12 conferences that discussed the new Standards. Officials in one of those states said that this approach allowed them to foster a positive environment for TPPs. The standards are set to go into effect on January 1, 2015. For more information, visit the U.S. Department of Education's website. communication and coordination among K-12 districts and TPPs. Most states reported that they modified their oversight activities to verify that TPPs were aligning with new K- 12 standards. 34 states reported deliberately modifying their TPP approval process to assess such alignment. Twelve other states did not report modifying their approval process for this specific reason, but did report assessing some or all TPPs against standards for TPP quality that may nonetheless provide information about alignment. For example, the Interstate Highway System provides transportation links between states and the federal government. Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium (InTASC) standards are commonly used standards for TPP quality. 27 states reported taking steps to modify the process for identifying low-performing TPPs. California reported modifying its process for approving TPPs to assess alignment with new K-12 standards. No states reported identifying a TPP as low- performing during the 2013-2014 academic year because of limited alignment with K- 12 standards. States also used modified licensing tests designed to assess individual teaching candidates’ preparation. such tests are used by 43 states. The testing companies both reported modifying those tests to align with new K-12 standards. Among the 8 states that do not use such tests, 4 reported in our survey that they modified their licensure requirements in other ways in response to thenew K- 12 standards. For example, all four of these states contract with testing companies to design customized tests and may request revisions. Pearson officials described working with one such state to modify its testing requirements to comply with the new standards. All 14 TPPs we interviewed made changes that ranged from large-scale reforms to more modest modifications. The changes generally fell within increasing subject-matter knowledge, modifying coursework related to teaching techniques, and using classroom training to provide real world experience. Examples of such changes, and related challenges, are listed below. Officials from 11 of 14TPPs described changing coursework.custom tests to align with new K-12 standards by adding more questions that measure teaching candidates’ ability to teach non-fiction texts. coursework or coursework requirements to ensure that teaching candidates had sufficient subject-matter knowledge to teach to the new K-12 standards. The three TPPs that did not make such changes were graduate-level programs or otherwise required teaching candidates to obtain a bachelor’s degree before attending the TPP. Officials from a few TPPs stated that most or all subject- Matter knowledge should be obtained prior to starting theTPP. The TPPs did make changes sometimes coordinated with other departments, such as math and English. For example, one TPP began offering courses that were co-taught by subject-area and TPP faculty. some academic departments were more receptive to modifying their curriculum than others, due to department priorities or other factors. For example, officials from one TPP observed that the new K-12 standards for English require the participation of teachers from multiple academic disciplines. TPP faculty members who were not in the English department were sometimes reluctant to modify their courses accordingly. Modifying coursework related to teaching techniques: Officials from all but one of the 14 TPPs we contacted described modifying courseworkrelated to teaching Techniques. For. example, one TPP said that candidates should learn teaching techniques that focus on the individual student. Officials from five TPPs said the new K-12 standards led them to start or expand courses on teaching techniques that are subject-matter specific. Using classroom training to provide real world experience: Officials from all 14 TPPs highlighted the importance of providing candidates with ample opportunities to apply the new standards in real classrooms. For example, officials from one TPP and a school district said it was important for candidates to make connections between different subject areas.on collaboration and officials from another said that it was key for students to be able to connect the dots between different subjects. Officials from 9 of the 14 TPPs described assessing candidates’ preparedness for the new K-12 standards. Officials from half of the TPPs acknowledged the difficulty of training new teachers in real classroom settings. In particular, officials from 6 TPPs said that school districts are training veteran teachers in the new standards at varying rates. Several TPPs also acknowledged that veteran teachers are being retrained at a higher rate than they were in the past. That could be a problem for the future of the profession. As states continue to implement the new K-12 standards, several TPPs said that they planned to make further modifications. One TPP that made a number of modifications to its program recently surveyed faculty and administrators to evaluate its efforts and identify any ongoing needs. Many states are beginning to adopt assessments to measure K- 12 students’ performance on the new standards. Officials from fiveTPPs said it will be important for them to measure students' performance on these new standards, as well as other issues. The current Title II data requirements may be of limited use in helping to improve the quality of TPPs. Education has not taken steps to evaluate whether any of them should be eliminated. Each state collects Title II information from colleges and universities that offer TPPs in the state and submits information about TPPs and some information about state oversight processes to Education annually. For example, they report the number and demographics of teaching candidates enrolled in and completingTPPs. As described below, states, TPPs, and other stakeholders often reported. 5 states said the Title II data were “very useful,” 19 said they were ‘moderately useful’ Less than half the states told us that they use the goals and assurances section of the reports. 8 of the 14 TPPs said very little of the data was useful to them for assessing the performance of their own programs. Few states reported using the data to inform state funding decisions or to provide information to school districts that are hiring teachers from TPPs, the authors say. A large online TPP defines most of its teaching candidates as enrolled in the state where the TPP is headquartered. The Title II report lists that state as one of the nation’s top teacher-producing states, while state officials told us that in fact the state faces teacher shortages. A TPP completer is someone who has met all the educational or training requirements in a state-approved course. Other requirements such as a certain sequence of courses can make it difficult for students to complete the program. of study for initial teacher certification or licensure. However, this definition allows for states or TPPs to choose whether they require their students to take and pass all state licensing tests before they can complete all of those educational or training requirements. As a result, different definitions of completer can lead to inconsistent data and make it difficult to make comparisons across TPPs or obtain a national picture. These varying ways of calculating and reporting key Title II data have persisted despite Education’s efforts to clarify guidance and improve reporting tools. its Title II contractor, have included clarified definitions, new guidance documents, and additional data checks in the online Title II reporting system. Education identified some potential data inconsistencies, such as differences in state definitions. Several states and TPPs with whom we spoke praised Education’s efforts to facilitate the Title II submission process, noting particularly that they have received excellent technical assistance when they have questions about the process. However, states andTPPs also noted remaining challenges, including how to interpret the requirements within the context of each state or TPP's specific circumstances. of alternate route TPPs, in its most recent Title II annual report, which presented information about the 2009-2010 academic year. Education does not include clarifications about potentially inconsistent data elements in published spreadsheets and on its website. Education officials told us they did not include such explanatory material in these other formats because they considered the explanations in the previous annual report to be sufficient. However, these documents are available on the Education Department's website and are available to the general public in a searchable form. By not providing the explanatory material, the data may be potentially misleading and make it difficult for users to compare across states or programs. By not providing these explanations, Education’s approach is not consistent with federal internal control standards, which require that pertinent information should be identified, captured, and distributed in a form that permits users to perform their duties efficiently. Education has made few efforts to share expertise about TPP quality among its offices. Various offices and programs within Education influence TPP quality, according to the report. The Office of Postsecondary Education administers Higher Education Act Title II reporting requirements. However, the agency does not have mechanisms in place to promote regular, sustained information-sharing among these offices. Education officials said the agency and its Title II contractor occasionally create custom Title II data runs for Education program offices. But there is no systematic effort to share Title IIData within the agency, officials said. Officials in one office that administers competitive grants related to TPP quality described discussing grant results internally, but did not systematically discuss TPP quality. Teacher quality workgroup has been inactive since the office in which it was housed reorganized in the fall of 2014. Education officials noted that such workgroups, particularly when operating out of high-level offices in the agency, have been very helpful for systematically sharing information across offices. This represents a missed opportunity to use relevant information, officials said. The agency has not subsequently resumed these information-sharing efforts, they said. It is unclear when the agency will resume the teacher quality workgroups. to bolster the effectiveness of several Education programs, such as Race to the Top and Supporting Effective Educator Development. Federal internal controls standards emphasize that effective information-sharing efforts are those that flow broadly across an agency in a form that is helpful for those who need it to carry out their responsibilities. Without such mechanisms, programs and offices within Education may not have access to clear and useful information about TPP quality. Furthermore, Education’s efforts to support or enhance TPP quality reach a limited number of states. to Education officials, several technical assistance and research entities and the office that administers competitive grants such as the Teacher Quality Partnership Grant Program. Only about one third of states reported receiving information from Education about TPP oversight or enhancing TPP quality. About half of all states said they would like additional support from Education on this topic. This suggests that Education is also missing opportunities to support states that could use relevant research and assistance from Education to enhance TPP quality, according to the report. 15 states surveyed said they want more information from the Department of Education about teacher preparation. states reported in our survey that they oversee TPPs through an independent standards board. Four states expressed concern about their access to Education resources for TPP improvements. Gaps in the agency’s efforts to disseminate information result from information- sharing being left to individual offices’ initiative rather than an agency-wide mechanism, Education officials noted in a follow-up inquires. The Education Department says more could be done to improve the TPP system in the U.S. and that it is looking into the matter. GAO: States must assess whether teacher preparation programs are low-performing. Without such an approach, Education may be missing opportunities to support state efforts to enhance TPP quality, GAO says. Education agreed with our four recommendations. GAO is sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of the Department of Education, and other interested parties. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (617)88-0534 or EmreyArrasM@gao.gov. GAO: We conducted our work from March 2014 to July 2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. To identify how states oversee TPPs, we surveyed state oversight entities from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. To assess the extent that Education’s data supports and encourages high quality, we reviewed select state reports and reports from Education contractors. We also conducted case studies in 5 states.

Summary:
At the end of July 2010, over 10,000 military medical personnel were deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. The United States’ military presence in Iraq is scheduled to end no later than December 31, 2011. The military has established five levels of medical care to treat injured or sick military personnel. Each level provides progressively more intensive treatment, with each level providing more advanced care. The U.S. command structure in Iraq and Afghan has evolved over time, with the commanding generals advised by a lead surgeon. A DOD directive governing medical care for DOD deployed civilians is inconsistent with in-theater guidance. DOD could reduce uncertainty about the level of routine care these deployed civilians can expect in theater. In response to a draft of this report, DOD mentioned to us that its operating units have sufficient organic medical support and the medical needs of deployed civilians are being met. DOD also agreed that the Commander of U.S. Central Command should revise its guidance to clarify thelevel of care that deployed civilians should receive. About 2,600 DOD civilian employees were deployed to Iraq, and about 2,000 to Afghanistan. DOD relies on its own deployed civilians to carry out or support a range of essential missions. It is unclear to what extent DOD civilians can expect routine medical care in theater, authors say. The issue has received continuing congressional interest, they say, but no one has been turned away from routine care in Theater of Operations. The authors say shortages of and high demand for medical personnel in certain specialties plays a role in decisions about whether to request medical forces. Commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan have been splitting or reconfiguring medical units. Army doctrine, which is the starting point for defining and planning a unit’s capabilities, has not been updated fully to reflect these changes in theater. Splitting medical units, such as level 3 combat support hospitals and level 2 forward surgical teams, in order to locate them in more areas increases the opportunities to provide advanced emergency care quicker and could save more lives, authors say. They say Army doctrine and the organizational design of medical units were top issues that needed to be updated to better reflect current practice. Gaps in medical capabilities can occur when medical providers do not deploy as expected. Backfilling involves the identification and deployment of medical personnel into theater. Cross-leveling involves the temporary relocation of personnel from one unit in theater to another. The Army could benefit from incorporating its lessons learned, where appropriate, and be better assured the current practice of splitting medical units does not lead to unnecessary staffing challenges, the authors say. They say the Army has not fully incorporated these current practices into Army doctrine and organizational documents.

Bureau of Reclamation's Friant Dam on the San Joaquin River became fully operational in the 1940s. Since then, much of the river's water has been diverted for agricultural uses. A U.S. District Court judge has since ruled that operation ofFriant Dam violates state law. Parties agreed to negotiate a settlement instead of proceeding to trial on a remedy regarding the court's ruling. Full implementation of the Settlement would require congressional authorization and appropriations.. A key legislative issue is how to finance Settlement implementation. Other challenges are how to achieve the Settlement's dual goals of fisheries restoration and water management.

Summary:
The military construction appropriation request for fiscal year 2008 included approximately $21.3 billion for military construction and family housing. As of fiscal year 2006, DOD had 3,731 installations, with 766 installations located overseas. In recent years, DOD has been undergoing a transformation to develop a defense strategy and force structure capable of meeting changing global threats. For confidential support, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or visit http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/. In September 2001, DOD issued its Quadrennial Defense Review Report. The report called for developing a permanent basing system that provides greater flexibility for U.S. forces. In August 2004, President Bush announced plans for a permanent base in the United States. The Pentagon has been reexamining overseas basing requirements to allow for greater flexibility to combat conventional and asymmetric threats worldwide. The U.N. Security Council has approved a resolution that would allow for permanent bases in the U.K., France and Germany. The integrated global presence and basing strategy is the culmination of various DOD studies. The initiative is intended to close bases no longer needed to meet Cold War threats. It also aims to bring home many U.S. forces while stationing more flexible, deployable capabilities in strategic locations around the world. In 2004 the United States.announced what has been described as the most comprehensive restructuring of U.s. military forces overseas since the end of the Korean War. The integrated global. presence and. basing. strategy is a culmination of several DOD studies, including the overseas basing and requirements study, the overseas presence. study, and the U.N. global posture study. DOD’s Defense Policy Review Initiative established a framework for the future of U.S. force structure in Japan. The initiative also includes a significant reduction and reorganization of the Marine Corps posture on Okinawa, Japan, to include a continuing presence for U.s. forces. The goal is to create the conditions to reduce the burden on local Japanese communities, including relocating units to other areas, including Guam, while repositioning U.N. forces to respond better to regional crises. relocating 8,000 marines and their estimated 9,000 dependents to Guam. The initiatives also include the relocation of Carrier Air Wing Five from Atsugi Naval Air Facility to Iwakuni Marine Corps Air Station, Japan. The relocation of a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier at Yokosuka Naval Base, Japan; deployment of a transportable ballistic missile defense radar system; relocation of training activities; land returns; and shared use of facilities. Guam is a U.S. territory. Guam is strategically located in the Pacific Ocean approximately 3,810 miles southwest of Honolulu, Hawaii. It is 1,600 miles east of Manila, the Philippines; and 1,560 miles southeast of Tokyo, Japan. Given its strategic location, Guam is an integral part of DOD’s logistical support system and serves as an important forward operational hub for a mix of military mission requirements. About 29 percent of the U.S. territory is made up of the Hawaiian Islands, which are the westernmost territory of the United States. land is controlled by DOD (see fig. 2), 52 percent is privately owned, and 19 percent is under the supervision of the Government of Guam. In 2003, the Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concern that the overseas basing structure had not been updated to reflect the new realities of the post-Cold War world. The committee has also expressed concern about the use of military construction budget authority for projects at bases that may soon be obsolete because of changes being considered in overseas presence and basing. master plans for the changing infrastructure requirements for U.S. military facilities in each of its overseas regional commands. At a minimum, the plans are to identify precise facility requirements and the status of properties being returned to host nations. The Senate report also directed DOD to provide congressional defense committees a report on the status and implementation of those plans with each yearly military construction budget submission through fiscal year 2015. The plans should also identify funding requirements and. the division of funding responsibilities between the United States and cognizant host nations, according to the report. The first report was due with the fiscal year 2005 military construction budget submission and is to be updated each succeeding year. The House conference report accompanying the 2004 military construction appropriation bill also directed the department to prepare comprehensive master plans with yearly updates through fiscal year 2009. The Senate report also directed GAO to monitor the comprehensive master plan being developed and implemented for the 2008 fiscal year.year 2008. The first report is due to be released in time for the start of the new fiscal year on October 1. The Senate Appropriations Committee noted the ambitiousness of the military construction program and the need for a well-developed master plan. In July 2006, the committee recommended deferral of two military construction projects at Andersen Air Force Base that were included in the President’s budget request until such time as they can be incorporated into a master plan for Guam. The committee also asked the military to provide the congressional defense committees with a report each year giving an assessment of the plans for the U.S. military presence on Guam. and viewed in that context. The Senate report also directed GAO to review DOD’s master planning effort for Guam. The committee directed the Secretary of Defense to submit to the appropriations committees a master plan for Guam by December 29, 2006, and a report accounting for the United States’ share of this construction program to project-level detail and the year in which each project is expected to be funded. Within DOD, the Under Secretary of defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics was tasked to prepare the master plan. Under Secretary assigned overseas regional combatant commands responsibility for preparing comprehensive master plans for their areas of responsibility. As shown in figure 3, PACOM coordinates East Asia and South Asia; EUCOM coordinates much of sub- Saharan Africa and Europe. CENTCOM coordinates efforts in the Middle East, the Horn of Africa, and Central Asia. Not shown are Northern Command, which coordinates activities in North America, and Southern Command,. which coordinates Activities in South America, Central America,and the Caribbean.detailed, comprehensive master plan. We did not include Northern and Southern Commands in our review because they have significantly fewer facilities outside of the United States. There are also four functional unified combatant commands that are assigned worldwide functional responsibilities not bounded by geography. Initial implementation details for the movement of U.S. Marines to Guam and associated military construction projects took place under the leadership of PACOM. In August 2006, OSD directed the Navy to establish JGPO to facilitate, manage, and manage the military construction on Guam.  execute requirements associated with the rebasing of Marine Corps assets from Okinawa to Guam, including master planning efforts. The office’s responsibilities include integration of operational support requirements, development, program, and budget synchronization; oversight of the construction; and coordination of government and business activities. JGPO was tasked to lead the coordinated planning efforts among the DOD components and other stakeholders to consolidate, optimize, and integrate the existing DOD infrastructure capabilities on Guam. It is expected to work closely with the Government of Japan and the local Guam government, other federal agencies, and Congress. JGPO and the Department of the Interior had formed a federal interagency task force. JGPO falls under the direct oversight of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Installations and Environment. In 2006, we reported that the master plans did not always explain how their implementation could be affected by other relevant and related defense plans and activities. This year’s master plans incorporated key changes associated with the continuing evolution of U.S. overseas basing strategies and requirements, the report says. posture plans will continue to mature to address new priorities. PACOM’s master plan discussed the progress of dynamic realignment initiatives, which will relocate military personnel and facilities in South Korea and Japan. The U.S. and Japanese governments had established an interim agreement in October 2005 involving the realignment of U.s. forces in Japan. This year, PACOM updated its master plan to include information on missile defense efforts in Eastern Europe and the creation of the U.N. Africa Command.  PACOM described the importance of relocating 8,000 marines and their dependents from Okinawa to Guam. PACOM provided information updating the status of the Land Partnership Plan and the Yongsan Relocation Plan, including a list of U.S. military camps and sites returned to the Government of South Korea, and describing the results from the South Korean military relocation program. The United States will retain a forward Marine Corps command and control capability to ensure a balanced, flexible contingency response capacity within the Asia-Pacific region. EUCOM's master plan stated that the U.S. signed individual agreements with the governments of Romania and of Bulgaria in 2005 and 2006. EUCOM also provided additional details, such as the mission, planned capabilities, equipment and aircraft, and population. Furthermore, EUCOM provided a status of ongoing transformation realignments in its operations in Eastern Europe. The United States is working with South Korea to establish a military presence in South Korea. The goal is to create a network of forward operating sites and cooperative security locations. area of responsibility, including listing the return of facilities to host nations, changes to its basing categories. The master plans also described recent efforts to proceed with formal negotiations with the governments of Poland and the Czech Republic on establishing missile defense sites. This year, DOD forecasted changes for next year’s master plans involving the development of a new command responsible for Africa, which is expected to be established by September 30, 2008. The President announced in February 2007 that the U.S. military will establish a new, separate U.s. Africa Command to enhance security. cooperation, extend humanitarian assistance, and build partnership capacity on the African continent. At the time of our review, U.S. involvement in Africa is shared among three combatant commands. PACOM is responsible for Madagascar, the Seychelles, and the Indian Ocean area off the African coast. EUCOM isresponsible for the largest swath of the continent: North Africa; West Africa, including the Gulf of Guinea; and central and southern Africa. CENTCOM covers the Horn of Africa—including Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Djibouti, and Sudan. New U.S. Africa Command eventually will encompass the entire continent of Africa except for Egypt. Discussions are ongoing on the possible headquarters location and what kinds of military forces would be assigned to the command. This year, the changes identified in the plans provided useful information on evolving costs and facility requirements in overseas basing. In addition, the commands continue to focus first on the mission and then on the infrastructure requirements needed to support the mission. For example, in CENTCOM’s master plan, the descriptions of each forward operating site are included. focus first on the mission and then on requirements by providing the type of mission the site has, the unit that it could host, and its role in the region. All of the commands provide similar information for their main operating bases, forward operating sites, and cooperative security locations. Even with the department’s effort to update the plans, there are still some areas that need to be addressed, such as the need to strengthen capabilities for rapid and flexible response in the central Asian states, the report says. The evolution of U.S. overseas defense basing strategies and requirements continues. OSD and the regional commands will be faced with more changes in the future. The changes occurring after this year’s plans were submitted to Congress will have to be reflected in next year's plans. The plans provided a much more comprehensive description of challenges and the potential effects on implementation. This year, PACOM provided information on remediation actions taken by USFK before returning installations to South Korea, such as skimming fuel from five camps. The plan was not a master plan because it did not include specific information on facility requirements, associated costs, and a timeline for specific actions. The results of the environmental statement could take up 3 years to complete. The exact size and makeup of the forces to move to Guam and the housing, operational, quality of life, and services support infrastructure required are not yet fully known and are expected to be identified and assessed during the parallel environmental assessment process. Based on the expected completion of theenvironmental impact statement, the master plan may not be completed until fiscal year 2009. analysis and the individual service and joint planning processes. DOD identified some Marine Corps units for relocation as a part of realignment initiatives. There are assessments still under way to determine the optimal mix of units in Guam and in Okinawa. The Marine Corps forces remaining on Okinawa will consist of Marine Air-Ground Task Force elements, such as command, ground, aviation, and the 12th Marine Regiment. The following Marine Corps. units have been identified for relocation to Guam: Third Marine Expeditionary Forces Command Element, Third Marine Division Headquarters, Third. Marine Logistics Group Headquarters. combat service support, as well as a base support capability. Approximately 10,000 marines plus their dependents are expected to remain on the island of Okinawa following the realignment of forces to Guam. The mix of units is significant because, according to Marine Corps officials, the functional and base support requirements will be based on the type, size, and number of units that will relocate to Guam and Okinawa. The Marine Corps is still determining the specific mix of. units and capabilities needed to meet mission requirements on both Guam and. Okinawa. JGPO is initiating a master plan that will reflect the building of flexible infrastructure that could accommodate any type of military units that may relocate to Guam. This determination will define the training and facility requirements, such as barracks, family housing, schools, and other infrastructure. However, in the absence of information on the number and mix of forces, it will be difficult to provide an accurate assessment of specific facility requirements to support the Guam realignment actions. DOD is still determining requirements for the Guam base. The Navy is planning on periodically berthing an aircraft carrier in Guam. A new carrier pier with additional capabilities will need to be constructed in order to accommodate this plan. Most of the aircraft from the aircraft carrier will also require temporary beddown at Andersen Air Force Base, which may cause additional facilities requirements. The exact size and mix of the Army missile defense task force as well as the infrastructure requirements are still being determined. The Army is currently training with the U.S. Air Force on how to defend against missile attacks. DOD is planning on basing a ballistic missile defense task force in Guam. The size and mix of this task force as well as the infrastructure requirements are still being determined. At the time of this review, Army officials projected that the missile defense site will be located at Andersen Air Force Base. DOD faces several significant challenges associated with its master planning effort for Guam, including funding requirements, operational challenges, and community impacts that could adversely affect the development of the island. The project is expected to be completed by the end of 2015.  Funding requirements for the military buildup on Guam are yet not fully identified and may be difficult to meet given other priorities and existing funding constraints. DOD agencies, such as the Defense Logistics Agency and Defense Education Activity, that will help support the services’ influx of personnel, missions, and equipment to Guam will likely incur additional costs that are not yet included in the current DOD $13 billion cost estimate. According to DOD officials, this cost estimate includes the costs to move Marine Corps forces.and implementation of the master plan. The Marine Corps move from Okinawa to Guam is estimated to cost about $10.3 billion. Of this amount for the move, the Government of Japan has agreed to contribute. However, the cost does not include the costs of other defense agencies to support the additional military personnel and dependents on Guam. According to JGPO, these costs will eventually be identified once further information is available on the master plan. The current DOD $13 billion cost estimate, for the Marine Corps Move, includes the cost of the move to Guam. $6.1 billion to develop facilities and infrastructure on Guam. Nearly half of Japan’s contribution, or $2.8 billion, is expected to be direct contributions. Government of Japan may encounter challenges in funding its share of the Marine Corps move. Guam is located in an area of the Pacific commonly referred to as Typhoon Alley, where on average 31 tropical storms develop annually. The area cost factors identify Guam as one of the more expensive locations for military construction in comparison with other locations in the United States. Marine Corps officials expect there will be additional facility repair costs periodically as a result of damage from typhoons and seismic shocks. Existing training facilities and ranges on Guam are not sufficient to meet the training requirements of the projected Marine Corps force. The effects of the increase in military forces, in terms of population and military infrastructure, on Guam’s unique economic and infrastructure requirements have not been fully addressed. The current population of Guam is estimated to be 171,000, and the projected future military population could increase it by more than 15 percent. Nonagricultural workers visas, capped at 66,000 per year, may be needed. Other challenges associated with an increase of foreign workers in Guam include providing support facilities and services. Future DOD operations may be constrained on Guam if improvements are not made to Guam’s infrastructure. DOD has not established a comprehensive and routine process to keep Congress informed on its progress dealing with these issues and the overall status of implementing the military buildup on Guam, the authors say. They say Congress is not in a position to help ensure the best application of limited federal funds and the leveraging of all available options. GAO: DOD needs several more years to complete a Guam master plan. GAO recommends that future PACOM plans address the extent to which they are seeking residual value compensation for U.S. capital improvements at installations returned to host nations. Congress should consider requiring the Secretary of Defense to report periodically to all the defense committees on the status of DOD’s planning efforts for Guam, GAO says. The report says DOD already provides status reports on its residual value negotiations to the Committees on Appropriations and Armed Services. address training limitations in its area of responsibility. Deputy Under Secretary of Defense responded that validated training requirements that are affected by force posture transformation plans should be addressed in overseas master plans. He further stated that nonprogrammed and nonvalidated training limitations experienced by service components were not appropriate for inclusion in the overseas commands’ risk assessment. While we are not aware of any non programed and non validate training limitations, our report discusses only those training limitations raised by senior command officials during our review. that if there is a need to make a distinction between nonvalidated versus validated training limitations, OSD and the overseas commands would work together to identify those validated limitations that should be addressed in their master plans. In response to this guidance U.S. Forces Japan provided information on training limitations. USFK omitted this information from the overseas master plan. This year OSD included in its guidance a requirement for the combatant commands to identify and discuss risks to their master plan as well as steps taken to mitigate those risks. inconsistency led to our recommendation that Congress require such reporting. We continue to believe that this information is necessary to provide a complete picture of the potential effects on infrastructure and funding requirements in South Korea. In commenting on our matter for congressional consideration that the Secretary of Defense report periodically to all the defense committees on the status of DOD’s planning efforts for Guam, the Deputy Under Secretary of defense responded that the Guam master plan is scheduled to be completed in 2008, at which time a copy will be provided. noted that Senate Report 109-286 directed DOD to submit a master plan for the military buildup on Guam by December 2006. DOD did not submit the plan for several reasons that we discuss in this report. Because the master plan cannot be completed until the environmental impact statement is completed, a process that could take until 2009. Also, DOD faces a variety of funding challenges, operational challenges, and community impacts that may both affect the development and timing of the Guam master plan and increase troop numbers. Costs for the U.S. government. In the interim before receiving a master plan, congressional oversight could be enhanced by periodically receiving an update on the planning efforts in Guam. DOD also provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which we incorporated where appropriated. We are sending the comments to the Department of Defense for further study and consideration. The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense’s comments are reprinted in appendix II. The exact size and makeup of the forces to be moved to Guam and the associated infrastructure required are not yet known. copies of this report to the Secretaries of Defense, the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force; the Commandant of the Marine Corps; and the Director, Office of Management and Budget. Copies will be made available to others upon request. In addition, this report will be available at no charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-4523. We compared the reporting requirements in the congressional mandate and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) guidance, which incorporated our prior recommendations. In order to identify improvements to the overseas master plan, we compared and contrasted the fiscal year 2007 and 2008 plans. We assessed the quantity and quality of information provided by the Defense Department. We also assessed the extent to which the plans address the challenges faced by the Department of Defense during implementation.members who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix III. quality of one plan’s responses for each of the data elements, including details on base categories, host nation funding levels, facility requirements and costs. We compared them to equivalent responses in other plans; formed conclusions as to the completeness, clarity, and consistency of the latest plan's responses. We also discussed with DOD officials our observations and recommendations, specific reporting requirements, and whether improvements in the guidance and reporting were needed. we also interviewed cognizant officials from DOD about the plans. various changes and challenges that were identified within the plans. We met with officials from OSD and each of the following commands and agencies: U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM); U. s. Army Pacific; Commander, U. S. Pacific Fleet; U.s. Marine Corps Forces, Pacific. U.N. Secretary-General's Security Council meeting to be held later this month in New York City to discuss military operations in the region. The meeting will also be held in Washington, D.C. to discuss the future of the military in Asia. European Command, U.S. Army Europe, and Special Operations Command. In general, we discussed the reporting requirements contained in OSD’s guidance, host nation agreements and funding levels. We also analyzed available reports, documents, policies, directives, international agreements, guidance, and media articles to keep abreast of ongoing changes in overseas defense basing strategies and requirements. To see firsthand the condition of the bases, go to www.cnn.com/cnndefense. facilities and status of selected construction projects. To determine the status of DOD’s planning effort for the buildup of forces and infrastructure on Guam, we met with officials from OSD, the Navy, PACOM, and the Joint Guam Program Office (JGPO) In general, we discussed the development of a Guam master plan and Guam infrastructure development plans. We toured facilities at Camp Schwab, Camp Kinser, Camp Foster, Torii Station, Camp Zama, Yokosuka Naval Base, and Yokota Air Base, Japan. the Integrated Military Development Plan with PACOM and JGPO officials. We visited Naval Base Guam and Andersen Air Force Base in Guam to see the installations and future military construction sites firsthand. We also reviewed DOD’s military construction budgets for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 and planned for future military buildup in Guam. We met with officials from U.S. Pacific Fleet; U. s. Marine Corps Forces, Pacific; and Pacific Air Forces to discuss the various factors that can affect U.s. infrastructure requirements. years to identify U.S. funding levels and sources planned for the military buildup in Guam. To identify challenges associated with the buildup in this planning effort, we met with the aforementioned DOD officials and other interested parties. We did not evaluate concerns raised by the officials, but we reviewed relevant federal laws and discussed them with DOD officials. We also analyzed available reports, documents, international agreements, and other available documents and information. The Guam Women’s Group, the Chamber of Commerce, the Civil Military Task Force, and the Office of the Delegate from Guam to the House of Representatives were also consulted. Special Operations Command planning efforts were not specifically required for the master plans in response to the congressional mandates. Southern and Northern Commands have significantly fewer facilities overseas than the other regional commands in the Pacific, Europe, and Central Asia. We conducted our review from September 2006 through July 2007 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing. and media articles to keep abreast of ongoing activities in Guam pertaining to challenges that may affect DOD’s development and implementation of a master plan.

Summary:
As of December 31, 2010, there were 6,364 community banks (commercial banks with total assets of $1 billion or less) This represents about 92 percent of all commercial banks, although only about 10 percent of commercial bank assets nationwide. Banks in the U.S. are supervised by one of the following three federal regulators: FDIC, Federal Reserve or OCC. The Federal Reserve supervises commercial banks that are state-chartered and members of the Federal Reserve System. OCC supervises federally chartered national banks. The purpose of federal banking supervision is to help ensure that banks throughout the financial system are operating in a safe and sound manner. Financial regulation more broadly has sought to achieve four goals: to ensure adequate consumer protections, ensure the integrity and fairness of markets, monitor the safety and soundness of institutions, and act to ensure the stability of the overall financial system. Federal banking regulators use a number of tools to achieve these goals, the authors say. For more information, visit www.banks.gov. Capital provides an important cushion against losses for banks. Capital can be measured as total capital or tier 1 capital. Regulators oversee the capital adequacy of their regulated institutions through ongoing monitoring, including on-site examinations and off-site tools. When banks fail to meet these goals, they may face fines or other penalties from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and other authorities. When a bank fails to meet the minimum capital requirements, it may be fined or other sanctions may be imposed by the federal government. regulators require banks to hold capital above regulatory minimums. These requirements may result from an enforcement action through an agreement between the regulator and the bank. Examinations and ratings: Federal banking laws and regulatory guidance require on-site examinations. At each full-scope examination, examiners review the bank’s risk exposure on a number of components. It may reduce the availability of bank credit and reduce returns on equity to shareholders. It can also affect a bank”s financial health. using what is known as the CAMELS rating system (Capital adequacy, Asset quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity, and Sensitivity to market risk) Evaluations of CAMELS components consider the institution’s size and sophistication, the nature and complexity of its activities, and its risk profile. In examinations, a bank is rated for each of the CAMEL components and given a composite rating. However, the composite is not an average of the component ratings. The component rating and the composite ratings are scored on a scale of 1 (best) to 5 (worst) typically correspond to the composite CAMELS ratings, with the actions generally increasing in severity as the ratings become worse. Table 2 describes the definitions of the composite scores under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System. In examinations, examiners review a sample of banks’ internal ratings of loans to determine the adequacy of credit risk administration and identify loans that show undue risk and may be uncollectible. As part of this review, Examiners determine which loans are considered “pass,” with no concerns noted, as well as those that are special mentioned or “classified” There are three classification categories used by the federal banking regulators: substandard, doubtful, and loss. These loan classifications, and the internal ratings that banks produce for all of their loans, are incorporated into how each bank calculates its allowance for loan and lease loss (ALLL) If additional loans are classified substandard or doubtful, this information is included in a bank’s updated ALLL estimates. If Loans are classified loss, they are not performing or may not perform in the future. charged off the bank’s balance sheet. The end result of an on-site examination is an ROE that includes the CAMELS ratings. CRE encompasses many different property types that present different risks. Table 4 describes the key CRE property types. Regulators define CRE loans to include construction loans, loans to finance CRE that are not secured by CRE, loans secured by multifamily property, and nonfarm, nonresidential property in which the primary source of repayment derives from the rental income associated.  CRE loans in which the primary source of repayment is not the property itself are called owner-occupied loans. For example, a line of credit for a business’s operating expenses might be secured in part by commercial property, such as an office. Owner-occupied properties generally are considered to carry less risk than non-owner- occupied properties because regulators consider them to be less sensitive to the condition of the CRE market. For more information on CRE loans, go to www.securitizer.gov. Construction and land development (CLD) loans are considered to be the riskiest class of CRE. They can include properties that are built before having firm commitments from buyers or lessees. By the time the construction phase is completed, market demand may have fallen, putting downward pressure on sales prices or rents. In recent years, this type of loan also has tended to have a much higher loss rate than other types of CRE, according to a report by the Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Banks report on four broad categories of CRE in their quarterly call reports. CLD: loans secured by real estate to finance land development and construction. Multifamily: loans for residential properties with five or more dwelling units, such as apartment buildings. Nonfarm nonresidential: Loans secured byreal estate for business and industrial properties, as well as properties such as hotels, churches, hospitals, schools, and charitable organizations. This category includes offices, retail, and other nonfarm commercial properties. warehouse space. Loans to finance CRE, construction, and land development (not secured by CRE). Interagency guidance issued in 2006 on concentrations in CRE and sound risk-management practices define CRE loans within these categories to include those in which repayment is dependent on the cash flow generated from the real estate itself. CRE as an asset class—and especially properties in the ADC category—is prone to volatility and cyclical behavior, as illustrated in this chart. When evaluating concentrations inCRE, examiners are instructed not to include owner-occupied properties in which the income or value of the property is not the primary source of repayment. the current CRE market downturn. This volatility and cyclical behavior is attributed to characteristics such as information-gathering difficulties, infrequent transactions, high transaction costs, rigid and constrained supply, long construction times, and a two-fold reliance on external finance. CRE is by nature diverse and localized. For example, shopping centers are one type of CRE, but even within this category properties can have significant differences depending on design, types of tenants, and other factors that can affect their value. Because of these factors, the supply of CRE in the marketplace has been constrained. is slow to respond to an increase in demand, which drives prices up when investor optimism rises. Conversely, the marketplace isslow to respond when the market supply of CRE catches up and new construction projects are delivered, resulting in oversupply and declining property values. According to regulatory officials, the weakness in the ADC sector during this crisis was primarily due to residential housing construction. That weakness affected the performance of other areas of CRE, such as strip malls. The recent downturn in the CRE sector has been particularly bad. downturn in the CRE markets can be seen in the market values for commercial property and the condition of the commercial mortgage- backed securities (CMBS) market. Market values for all major commercial property types have declined significantly. As of December 2010, overall CRE market values were down more than 42 percent from their peak in 2007. This decline followed a rapid appreciation in CRE asset values during which CRE values increased by more than 85 percent from 2002 to the market’s peak in October 2007.  CMBS issuance slowed severely since the CRE downturn started. By January 2011, the delinquency rate on loans included in CMBS was at a record high, above 9 percent. High-value properties in markets such as New York, Washington, San Francisco, and Boston are showing signs of recovery. The CRE market price deterioration appears to have leveled off recently, but vacancies at many properties remain high. The signs of a market recovery have been uneven in different areas of the U.S. and across the country. Low rental rates and high vacancies indicate that demand for office, retail, multifamily housing, and warehouse space remains relatively weak. Although CRE markets nationally have experienced a downturn, some regions have experienced more distress than others. The South, Midwest, and West have experienced greater stress and deterioration than the East. Community banks increasingly have moved toward providing CRE loans more than other kinds of loan products, in part in part because of the CRE market's strength. The CRE market has performed well more recently. Community banks have increased their focus on CRE lending. CRE collateral backed about 30 percent of total loans and leases at community banks in 2000. A decade later that rate increased to more than 43 percent. Nearly a third of community banks are exposing three times their total capital to risks related to their CRE loans. The decline in CRE values has contributed to more noncurrent CRE loans, charge-offs, and bank failures. The fall in CRE market value declines could reduce overall small business lending by community banks. problem of CRE loan refinancing may exacerbate the negative CRE trends and limit lending to small businesses. CRE loans usually are written for 3–10 years, with a 20–30 year amortization schedule and a balloon payment at the end. Small businesses that are looking to refinance a loan against a property that has lost a significant amount of market value may have to put up more equity. Alternatively, such borrowers might default on the loan, or the lender might be forced to sell the property. About $1.7 trillion in CRE mortgages will mature between 2011 and 2015, with about half of that held at banks. About 60 percent of CRE debt maturing in 2011 is “underwater” Due to price declines and stricter bank underwriting standards, those mortgages will be difficult to refinance.bank could work with the borrower to restructure the loan and avoid default. Results from the Federal Reserve’s Senior Loan Officer were published in the June issue of The Federal Reserve Journal. Opinion Survey have suggested that new CRE borrowers have faced tighter credit conditions. Banks tightening their underwriting standards in response to the downturn. Trend of tighter credit standards suggests that borrowers who previously were considered creditworthy might not meet banks’ higher standards. The regulators have been aware for some time of the risk-management challenges related to growing CRE banks. The January 2011 survey found that 10.6 percent of respondents reported easing credit standards over the previous 3 months, compared to 10.5 percent who reported tightening them. Bank officials say regulators have applied guidance rigidly since financial crisis. Regulators have been incorporating lessons from the financial crisis in their supervisory practices, which in part are based on lessons learned from the crisis. The regulators have issued guidance to banks on managing CRE concentration risks, conducted training on CRE treatment, and conducted internal reviews to better ensure examiner compliance with CRE guidance, the report says. The report also says that regulators have been too harsh in classifying loans and improperly applying the 2006 CRE guidance. Regulators began to address CRE concerns before financial crisis, authors say. OCC review found potential for improvement in banks’ risk-management processes for CRE concentrations, they say. In October 2009, after the start of the financial crisis and the widespread deterioration in CRE loan performance, regulators issued interagency guidance on CRE loan workouts, they write. They say the guidance was not intended as forbearance, but to encourage prudent loan workouts. The authors: Bank officials’ experience of increased stringency in supervision may explain it. Federal banking regulators help ensure consistency among examinations, and appropriate application of guidance. Regulators’ internal reviews include comprehensive audits that recur periodically, and real-time and post-ROE quality processes. Some of the internal review processes have identified inconsistencies in the application of CRE guidance. Examiners told us that the examples have helped to resolve differences of opinion with bankers on how to treat certain CRE- related loans. The process and the staff involved vary slightly for each regulator and based on a bank’s CAMELS rating. Bank officials say examiners have been more critical of recent appraisals. If the borrower lacks the ability to repay, the loan then could be considered “collateral dependent.” Such loans are classified based on the value of the property, and tend to rely on values established in appra isals. Classifications are a major concern for banks primarily because they can result in reduced earnings. For example, an examiner may determine that an applicant may not be able to repay the loan. Bank examiners have been asking bankers to place more loans on nonaccrual. Classifications also can reduce earnings because they factor into ALLL. As more loans are classified, more is generally reserved in ALLL to anticipate future losses from nonperforming loans. In our interviews with bank officials, some stated that some stated.that a bank should place a classified loan on non Accrual—which means the bank cannot accrue the interest income as earnings. It is not clear if the bank has made such a move. that examiners have been requiring additional ALLL and criticizing the ALLL methodology. In addition, a few bankers noted that some examiners want ALLL increased based on their peers’ ALLL rather than the bank’s individual situation. Many bank officials with whom we spoke were concerned that examiners had been misapplying the 2006 guidance. The 2006 guidance states that the CRE and ADC concentration levels are not limits, but some bank officials told us that examiner have been interpreting them that way. the 2006 guidance: some examiners were including owner-occupied CRE and some were using the wrong type of capital for the calculation, which inflated the concentration levels. A few bankers stated that examiners told them they exceeded the 300 percent concentration threshold for CRE, based on these faulty calculations, but according to the calculations in the guidance they actually were under the threshold. Some bank officials also stated that it was unclear to them what examiners expect in complying with requirements related to CRE and risk management. example, on what is considered to be satisfactory stress testing. While more bank officials than not noted that examiners’ actions have been consistent with the letter of the 2009 CRE loan workout guidance, a few said examiners were not always complying with its spirit. Two bankers with whom we spoke stated that it was their experience that examiner were particularly stringent in 2008 when the financial crisis was escalating, but moderated their approach in late 2009, which is around the time that the 2009 guidance was issued. CRE loan workout guidance was issued. An internal review by OCC’s Midsize and Community Banks Division came to a similar conclusion. Examiners have become more consistent in their CRE loan treatment through internal discussions, training, and policy communication efforts. A few bank officials with whom we spoke provided specific suggestions on how to improve policy guidance. But a few others felt that some form of general regulatory reprieve was needed for CRE lenders in the U.S. and around the world.

Bank officials we interviewed also stated that their experience with increased supervisory scrutiny was being reflected in CAMELS ratings and additional capital requirements. For example, many bank officials thought the management component rating was more critically assessed now, and heavily driven by asset quality and other component ratings. Some bank officials added that they were being rated on deterioration in their portfolios that was due to the broader economic downturn and problems in their geographic market that were out of their control. examiners have been more aggressive about requiring additional capital. Two bank officials in particular stated they thought this was especially the case for banks with high CRE concentrations. However, a few bankers thought the additional scrutiny was appropriate, but should not necessarily be focused on all banks. One banker stated that if examiners had been applying the guidance stringently before the crisis that perhaps the banks could have avoided some of the current problems. A few others also noted that stricter scrutiny is appropriate given the current CRE market situation and the severity of the economic downturn. Regulators have been incorporating into their regulatory processes a number of lessons learned from the financial crisis. A few bank officials stated that the regulators should focus on the community banks that caused the problems, rather than subjecting all community banks to such strict scrutiny. As noted in a December 2010 report by the FDIC IG that summarizes certain MLR findings, FDIC determined based on the MLRs that earlier supervisory action could have been taken against the failing banks. The report was based on findings from the IGs of the banking regulators in 2009 and 2010. was needed to address banks with high risk profiles or weak risk-management practices. We also found in past work that regulators identified a number of weaknesses in institutions’ risk- management systems before the financial crisis began but did not always take forceful actions to address them. A number of nonmanagement regulatory staff in the field offices we visited acknowledged they could have better followed up on outstanding issues. In response to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission report notes areas in which regulators could have been more proactive in using regulatory tools to address certain risks. lessons learned, regulatory officials stated that they have been following up more often on matters requiring attention (MRA) and refocusing their supervisory efforts. OCC’s Midsize and Community Banks Division issued an MRA Reference Guide that provides examiners with OCC policy guidance on how to report, follow up on, and keep records related to MRAs. FDIC in June 2009 implemented its “Forward Looking Supervision” program that re-emphasizes reviewing all aspects of a bank’S risks during the examination process. a bank’s financial condition; (2) examiners review risks associated with concentrations and wholesale funding sources; and (3) appropriate capital is maintained. Based on our analysis of a nonprobability sample of 55 ROEs, examiners’ findings were generally consistent with policy guidance, with some exceptions. Examiners made statements in ROEs related to the quality of banks’ loan workouts that were consistent with the 2009 guidance on CRE loan workouts. ROEs in our sample that comment broadly on Banks’ CRE Loan workouts tend to cite areas for improvement (20 of 27). Examiner concerns include that the bank management or its board could have better identified, monitored, or tracked problem loan workouts. Improvements to managing loan workouts that examiners cited include reporting on current loan status and related developments. Almost half of the ROEs in our sample that raise concerns related to CRE were ROEs that raised concerns relatedto TDRs. The study was based on a survey of more than 1,000 bank examiners in the U.S. and Europe. The report was published by the American Bankers Association. loan workouts (8 of 20) specifically note concerns about the nature of banks’ loan workouts. In our sample, most ROEs (44 of 55 sampled) raise concerns about CRE concentrations and how they are managed. In more than half of those (24 of 44), the concerns are supported by risk-management deficiencies and explicitly cite the 2006 CRE loan workout guidance. For example, in these cases, examiners most often stated that loans were restructured and extended on unsustainable terms that resulted in further asset quality deterioration. CRE concentration guidance. The findings include concerns on the bank’s need to update or enhance internal policies on CRE concentration limits and CRE underwriting acceptable to the bank. In 7 instances (of 44), the ROE includes statements that the bank must reduce its CRE concentrations. However, the basis for this requirement was unclear or appeared. The bank has a history of underwriting CRE loans that are not considered to be ‘high risk’ by the Federal Reserve. It has also underwritten some CRE loans in the past that are considered “high risk.” inconsistent with the 2006 CRE concentration guidance. In two other instances the ROEs state that the bank must reduce its CRE concentrations but do not focus on the bank’s risk-management systems. Differences in message between an ROE and an enforcement action could be confusing to bank boards and management as they seek to comply with regulatory requirements for risk management related to CRE concentrations. Such confusion could lead bank officials to misunderstand whether they should focus on improving their risk- management systems or just reduce their total CRE concentration numbers. particular provided ambiguous information to the bank about whether it had the appropriate risk-management systems in place to manage its CRE concentrations. The ROE requires a bank with a CRE concentration of about 600 percent of tier 1 capital to address a matter requiring immediate attention to improve stress testing for its CRE portfolio. However, the ROE states that the bank was in compliance with the 2006 CRE guidance—which requires robuststress testing for CRE portfolios when banks reach certain levels of CRE. The bank needed to reduce itsCRE concentrations. address a matter requiring immediate attention related to CRE risk management and noting that the bank must reduce its CRE concentrations. Some ROEs appear to include owner-occupied CRE as part of the CRE. A number of them did not include CRE concentration numbers that were calculated according to the 2006 CRE guidance. For example, some ROEs appeared to includeOwner-occupiedCRE as part the CRE, even though the guidance does not mention it. For other ROEs, the CRE concentration information did not appear to be included in the CRE information. concentration calculation (14 of 47), although the 2006 CRE guidance specifically excludes this type of CRE. We also found that 23 of these 47 ROEs include CRE concentrations calculated by using some combination of tier 1 capital. Another 24 ROEs specify using either total risk-based capital or equity capital. The effect of calculating these concentrations differently can be to increase the total CRE concentration number, which can lead to a loss of revenue for the bank. We found that this effect can be significant. increases the scrutiny placed on the banks’ risk- management systems. While FDIC clarified to its examiners in April 2010 how to calculate CRE concentrations, other regulators have not done so. Two of the banks in our sample have a concentration calculated with tier 1 capital at 141 percent; with total risk-based capital it was 133 percent. But the difference can be smaller: one ROE in our Sample has a concentration of 432 percent when using tier 1capital and 341 percent with total Risk-based Capital. We interviewed about 200 field staff associated with the bank examination review process at FDIC, Federal Reserve, and OCC. A number of field examiners from all the agencies stated they did not have the tools to proactively address growing CRE concentrations when the economy was strong. Some examiners did not think that limits were the answer, but others thought that there might be some level of concentration that was too high even when managed well. Some thought that a focus on additional capital would be sensible given the severe capital shortfalls some banks with CRE concentrations faced during the financial crisis. Examiners exercise significant judgment during examinations. Different perceptions about the 2006 guidance among regulators could send mixed signals to examiners. Monitoring and revising existing controls is a key component of a strong internal control system. Regulators require banks to maintain certain minimum capital requirements to help ensure the safety and soundness of the banking industry. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is the world’s largest regulator of banks, with a market value of more than $1.2 trillion.  increases in capital requirements can raise the cost of providing loans. This would lead to higher interest rates for borrowers, tighter credit terms, or reduced lending. Holding more capital against each loan means less equity is available to return to shareholders or back new loans. For example, researchers found more capital is needed for each new loan than for a previous loan. For more information, visit www.system.gov.uk or call 0203 615 4157.

Researchers found that bank capital requirements substantially affected bank loan growth during the last economic downturn. Those banks with “low or no profits and an inability to obtain new capital at reasonable rates’ decreased their assets and liabilities to meet the higher capital-to-asset ratios required by regulatory enforcement actions. Using the “capital crunch hypothesis,” the researchers found that institutions with lower capital ratios had slower loan growth (or loans shrank more rapidly) to try to meet regulatory requirements. satisfy capital requirements. Banks with capital bases that have been negatively affected by losses in their CRE portfolios may need to reduce lending to maintain an adequate capital-to-assets ratio on their balance sheets. Although limited research exists on the impact of CRE loan concentrations on a bank’s ability to lend, an existing study shows that high CRE concentrations can limit loan growth during economic downturns. For example, this study found that banks with high CRE. concentrations before the recent financial crisis made loans to other sectors of. the economy during this crisis at a “significantly slower rate’ than banks that did not have high CRE exposure. The higher the bank’s CRE concentration prior to the crisis, the more its non-CRE lending slowed during the crisis. The authors hypothesize that the rise in CRE lending and the substantially increased delinquencies on these loans “could have inhibited banks’ willingness or ability to lend to other segments of the economy.” The reasons for the contraction of non- CRE lending during the Crisis are being examined. The authors cite the possibility that high-CRE banks may have failed at a greater rate than banks without that level of CRE exposure. Bankers we interviewed attributed the CRE downturn to market factors such as problems in residential real estate that affected the CRE market and the severity of the broader financial and economic crisis. Although bankers did blame CRE banks for the downturn, the authors say the regulatory effect of examiner actions on such downturns was minimal. The authors conclude that market factors tend to drive CRE downturns. not state that regulatory policies were the cause of the CRE downturn, many noted that examiner actions were exacerbating it. A few stated banks needed to be given time to work through their troubled assets so they could continue to lend and support the economy. Other bankers stated that examiners have been impeding banks’ ability to make new loans. That said, a few bankers noted that CRE loan demand from creditworthy borrowers was down significantly, and this was inhibiting loan growth. There is limited research on the effect of examiner actions. on credit cycles; however, the studies that exist suggest the effects are minimal. In an analysis of the credit crunch from 1989 to 1992, researchers found modest support for the hypothesis that increased regulatory “toughness” occurred. In a comprehensive study spanning the last financial crisis, three hypotheses were tested regarding changes in regulatory toughness and its impact on bank lending. The data provided what the authors call “modest support” for all three hypotheses that: (1) toughness increased during the creditCrunch from 1989 through 1992, and (2) it declined during the boom from 1993. through 1998, and (3) differences in toughness affected bank lending. During the credit crunch they studied, the data show no more than 1 percent additional loans receiving classification or worsening of classification status. The authors also reviewed the economic significance of changes in regulatory “toughness” and found that growth in the number of classified assets by 1 percent would be predicted to decrease the ratio of real estate loans to gross total assets by less than 1 percentage point over the long term. The data show a similar change for a decrease in loan classifications. Changes in CAMEL ratings were not found to have a “consistent’ impact on future lending behavior. When there was an impact, the data show that it was minimal. The researchers also noted that, based on their research, banks may respond “asymmetrically” to changes in CAMel ratings. These studies suggest examiners’ actions can affect lending, albeit minimally. However, research suggests that regulators were more regulators.this impact was projected to be significantly less than 1 percentage point. stringent during the past credit crunch, even holding financial conditions constant. Regulators should be aware of how their actions can affect broader credit markets. The procyclical effects of regulation may not adequately discourage overly risky behavior during economic upswings or may inhibit bank lending during downturns, as banks may need to meet their obligations. The U.S. and foreign regulators have been attempting to address the procyclicals effects of their actions in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis in the United States and abroad. more stringent requirements during times when it is more difficult to do so. For instance, if regulators increase capital requirements at the same time that losses from an economic downturn decrease banks’ capital, banks may be less able to lend while they seek to rapidly raise additional capital. This can exacerbate downswings in credit cycles. Consistent and balanced application of policy guidance in strong and weak economic times is important to avoiding unnecessary procyclical effects, according to the IMF. The IMF urges regulators to ensure that guidance is applied consistently during strong andweak economic periods. economic upturns or downturns. Bank examiners with whom we spoke in the field offices also noted that problems can be difficult to identify during strong economic times. Discussions about the procyclicality of regulation have been a central feature of recent deliberations on revised capital requirements among U.S. banking regulators and the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision. The discussions have been seeking to address the pro cyclical effects of banking regulation in the United States and around the rest of the world. The Basel Committee released the framework for Basel III in December 2010. It includes increased and higher-quality capital requirements, enhanced risk coverage, and steps to encourage the “build up” of capital. The Basel committee has established procedures to help ensure the consistent global application of this framework. It has also introduced two global liquidity standards to help with the development of the global capital market for the banking sector in the future. The framework is expected to be in place by the end of 2014. developed standards that will be implemented gradually so that banks make the shift to higher capital and liquidity standards while “supporting lending to the economy” Federal bank regulators also have acknowledged the importance of addressing procyclicality in regulatory requirements and have made efforts in this regard. In addition, FASB has issued accounting guidance aimed at changes in accounting standards for the financial sector. The Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Forum have worked to address this as it relates to capital requirements. For example, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve has stated the. importance of regulators acknowledging the significance of procyclicals. to mark-to-market accounting for assessing asset values in inactive markets. More recently, in May 2010, FASB released a proposed Accounting Standards Update, which encompassed proposals on the impairment of financial assets and suggested implementing a more forward-looking impairment model. Efforts such as these seek to address procyclicality concerns related to capital and accounting requirements, while the potential procyclicals effects of examiners’ application of policy. Based on exposure draft comments, in January 2011 FasB proposed with the International Accounting Standards Board a common solution on how to account for financial assets. The recent financial crisis underscored how important it is for regulators to evenly apply guidance during strong economic periods. Consistent application of guidance is important to avoid unduly hampering credit provision throughout the economy. CRE still is working through a downturn sparked by the broader financial crisis, presenting an ongoing challenge to community banks and regulators. While community banks have been working through the challenges associated with many years of past growth, CRE is still working through its own challenges of the past few years, officials say. Community banks continue to seek ways to work with their borrowers and shore up capital. Since the financial crisis, the shift in examination focus and differences in the application of the CRE concentration guidance has contributed to concerns among community banks. Regulators have mixed views about the adequacy of the 2006 guidance, the authors say. They recommend that the Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Board of Governors, and the Comptroller of the Currency: Enhance and either re-issue or supplement interagency CRE concentrations guidance. GAO: Federal banking regulators all have numerous controls to help ensure examination consistency. We found instances of inconsistency in the treatment of CRE loans and application of 2006 CRE guidance. We continue to believe that our recommendations on enhanced or clarified CRE concentration guidance would help bankers and examiners better understand how to comply with CRE risk management requirements. We are sending copies of this report to FDIC, the Federal Reserve, OCC, and other interested parties. If you or your staffs have any questions about this report, please contact A. Nicole Clowers at (202) 512-8678. CAMELS composite ratings of 4 or 5, a 300 percent or greater concentration in overall CRE in the 75th percentile or greater for the banks in our sample. Once we selected these pools, we began contacting banks to interview. To understand banks’ concerns about examiners’ treatment of their CRE loans and how examiners supported findings related to CRE loans, we interviewed bank and regulatory officials and analyzed ROEs. We interviewed more than 230 regulatory field staff at FDIC, throughout the Federal Reserve System, and at OCC. OCC, we reviewed reports from all four of its districts related to the agency’s quality assurance process that focused on reviewing the classifications of CRE loans. We also discussed with Federal Reserve staff whether other similar studies existed. We reviewed and summarized academic studies that included analysis of various factors. To determine and assess the factors that can affect banks’ lending decisions and their impact, we Reviewed and summarized Academic studies that include analysis of Various factors. We Reviewed a special engagement report from the General Auditor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and a Quality Assurance memorandum. on bank lending. With assistance from a research librarian, we conducted searches of research databases and report sources. We also sought and reviewed studies cited by the American Bankers Association (ABA) and the Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA) All studies included published papers released between 1991 and 2010. Based on our selection criteria, we determined that six studies were sufficient for our purposes. We analyzed the methodologies underlying these studies and determined that they were sound. The study was published in the Journal of Economic Literature. were the most relevant to our study and also had robust controls. The research conducted in this area is not exhaustive and focuses primarily on what occurred during the previous economic downturn of the late 1980s and early 1990s. One study examines the role of CRE and its effect on bank lending in the current financial crisis. To further demonstrate how loan losses, allowance for loan and lease losses, and capital requirements can affect lending, we developed an illustrative example of how Loan losses affect capital ratios on a bank’s balance sheet. from certified public accountants. Increases in capital requirements or the allowance for loan and lease loss (ALLL) can affect a bank’s ability to lend. Figure 6 illustrates relationships between loan losses, bank balance sheets, and capital requirements under certain assumptions. In this simplified example, the bank begins with $1,000 in assets ($1,010 in loans and $10 in ALLL), $900 in liabilities, and $100 in capital, which equates to a $100 loan loss. total capital ratio of 10 percent (calculated by dividing total capital by total assets) In this example the bank has analyzed the collectibility of its loans and decided to add $20 to its ALLL in anticipation of loan losses. Provisions for these losses increase the ALLL, which in turn are charged to the bank’s expenses, reduce income, and therefore reduce retained earnings that are included as part of total capital. As a result, the capital ratio falls to 8.2 percent. or chooses not to because the cost of capital is prohibitive, then it could, among other options, reduce its assets. Reducing assets is often referred to as “shrinking the balance sheet’ However, banks in better financial condition may be able to respond differently in the face of loan losses. They may be. able to continue lending without raising additional capital or can rely on their stronger financial position to secure new. capital to secure their new capital.

Summary:
The Obama Administration has been critical of the apparently flawed Russian presidential election which took place on March 4, 2012. Some in Congress also have criticized the conduct of the election, but have endorsed continued engagement. Congress may consider the implications of another Putin presidency, lagging democratization, and human rights abuses in Russia as it debates possible future foreign assistance and trade legislation. The trigger for wider open discontent was a December 2011 election to Russia's legislature, the Duma, that was widely viewed by many Russians as not free and fair.

Summary:
The Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act granted responsibility for managing marine resources to the Secretary of Commerce. NMFS is part of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) The act also established eight regional fishery management councils, each responsible for making recommendations about managing fisheries in federal waters. The eight councils include the Caribbean Council, covering waters off the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The councils are made up of fishing industry participants and state and federal fishery managers. Gulf of Mexico Council, covering waters off Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and the west coast of Florida. Mid-Atlantic Council covers waters off New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. New England Council covering waters of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. North Pacific Council covered waters off Alaska; Pacific Council covering California, Oregon, and Washington. Western Pacific Council covers Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and uninhabited islands. U.S. territories in the Western Pacific. NMFS has six regional science centers, which are responsible for generating the scientific information necessary for the conservation, management, and use of each region's marine resources. Alaska Center, covering the coastal oceans off Alaska and parts of the west coast of the United States. Northeast Center covering waters along the Northeast Continental Shelf from the Gulf of Maine to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Northwest Center covering the northeast Pacific Ocean, primarily waters off the coasts. of California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia; Pacific Islands Center, covering the central and western Pacific Ocean; Southwest Center, primarily covering waters off the coast of California and areas throughout the Pacific and Antarctic Oceans. Southeast Center, covers waters along the continental southeastern United States as well as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Magnuson-Stevens Act, as amended by the Sustainable Fisheries Act, also established national standards for fishery conservation and management. These standards deal with preventing overfishing, using scientific information, using fishery resources efficiently and minimizing bycatch. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (Pacific Council) released its initial Fishery management plan for groundfish in 1982. The Pacific Council’s goal is to have long-range plans for managing groundfish fisheries that will promote a stable planning environment for the seafood industry and will maintain the health of the resource and environment. To help achieve these goals, stock management plans are being developed by the Pacific Council to help protect and restore the fishery's long-term health and stability. The council is also working to develop appropriate plans for conserving and managing fisheries under their jurisdiction. assessments are conducted on groundfish species to estimate fish populations. Since 1995, the Northwest Center has had lead responsibility for conducting stock assessments on Pacific groundfish. The Northwest Center receives assistance from other NMFS science centers, such as the Southwest Center, which conducted the bocaccio assessment. Stock assessments are the biological evaluation of the status of fish stocks. They provide official estimates in key areas, including the size of the stock population, the size. of the spawning population, and the amount of fish that have died. Stock assessments form the scientific basis used by regional councils to determine biologically sustainable harvests and guide the monitoring and rebuilding of overfished and threatened stocks. For example, regional councils use stock assessments and other indicators of biological productivity to recommend to NMFS a maximum, or total allowable catch, in a particular fishery. Without stock assessments, fishery managers would have limited information about the status of fisheries in making decisions about setting harvest levels. For each species, the assessor reviews for each species. previous stock assessments, gathers available data about the species being assessed, runs the data through computer-generated models, and estimates the species’ total biomass. Stock assessors use NMFS-collected data, such as stock surveys conducted on NOAA vessels or contracted commercial fishing vessels, as well as data collected by non-NMFS sources. Commercial and recreational fisheries data—the amount and composition of fish caught from a particular stock, whether caught intentionally or not. Stock abundance—surveys of how many fish constitute a stock’s total size or weight. by commercial and recreational fishermen or unintentionally caught and discarded. Data sources include fishing logbooks, dockside samples, and onboard observations, among others. Data on the abundance of juvenile and larval fish (fish at their earliest stage), which helps scientists forecast the size of a particular stock in the future. Synoptic oceanographic sampling—data data on the relationship between a fish stock and its physical environment, as well the relationship of a fishStock to other species. Data about the age and sex composition of the stock, age at first maturity, fertility, average lifespan and natural mortality. on the ocean ecosystem, such as water temperature or salinity, plankton composition, or ocean currents. For each stock assessment, a review panel, consisting of NMFS scientists and outside experts, independently reviews the methodology of the assessment and works with the assessor to ensure their comments are adequately addressed. Through 2003, 24 of the 82 species of Pacific groundfish have had a full quantitative stock assessment. Relying on these assessments, NMFS has declared that nine species ofPacific groundfish are overfished. Pacific hake, also called Pacific whiting, is generally found off the west coast of North America. It is one of many species of hake distributed in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Fishermen use mid-water trawls and generally fish over the ocean bottom at depths of 100 to 500 meters. Pacific hake was declared overfished in 2002 because the 2002 stock assessment estimated that the species was over-fished.darkblotched rockfish, and yelloweye rockfish. Pacific hake biomass at 700,000 metric tons. By 2004, the biomass was estimated at between 2.7 and 4.2 million metric tons, and Pacific hake is no longer considered overfished. Bocaccio rockfish generally inhabit waters off the coast of northern Baja, Mexico to Alaska. They are commercially fished using trawls, hook-and-line and gillnets. They commonly live over rocky areas or open areas of the ocean’s floor to about 320 meters. Canary rockfish inhabit the northeastern Pacific Ocean, from northern Baja, Mexico to the western Gulf of Alaska. Adult canary rock fish are primarily found along the continental shelf, from 46 to 457 meters deep. Canary rockfish are harvested commercially using trawl nets and hook-and-line and are also considered an important species for recreational fishermen. NMFS declared canaryRockfish as overfished in 2000. The 2002 stock assessment estimated the canary Rockfish biomass at 6,197 metric tons. rockfish are found in the waters from Santa Catalina Island, California to the Bering Sea on soft bottom areas at about 29 to 549 meters deep. Commercial fishery concentrations are located off the coasts of California and Oregon. Darkblotched rockfish are caught primarily by commercial trawls and contribute to both commercial and recreational fishing. NMFS determined that darkblotches rockfish was overfished in 2000, when the last full stock assessment was conducted; it was updated in 2003. almost exclusively inhabit rocky areas from northern Baja, Mexico to the Aleutian Islands, Alaska. Yelloweye rockfish, found in depths ranging from 15 to 550 meters, are caught using both trawl nets and line gear. NMFS determined that the species was overfished in 2002. The reliability of NMFS’ stock assessments is questionable for the Pacific hake and Pacific tilapia, as well as yelloweye and Pacific bluegill. The 2002 stock assessment estimated the yelloweye biomass at 2,325 metric tons in 2001. four rockfish species we reviewed, although they were based on the best information available at the time the assessments were conducted. The reliability of the stock assessments we reviewed is questionable. Four of the assessments did not have at least one NMFS-collected data source of sufficient scope and accuracy. NMFS lacked a standard process for assessing the reliability of non-NMFS data used in all five assessments. For four of the assessment reports, the stock assessment reports did not adequately identify the uncertainty of the biomass estimates.  stock assessors use a variety of data, including NMFS data and non-NMFS data, in developing their assessments. Two key pieces of NMFS survey data are the shelf and slope bottom trawl survey and the acoustic survey. Other data that assessors sometimes use include larval surveys (data for fish in their earliest stage) and recruitment data.plans to increase the scope and accuracy of its collected data, as additional funds become available; is implementing changes that will help ensure the reliability of non- NMFSData. Northwest Center officials raised concerns about basing assessments solely on non-NMFS data. The non- NMFS data assessors use include commercial catch data and recreational catch data. A 2002 National Research Council report found that the inclusion of NMFS survey data was the best option for a reliable estimate of abundance because such surveys use an unbiased statistical design, control sampling locations, and provide for quality assurance. According to Northwest Center officials, each stock assessment should include at least one source ofNMFS-collected data. such as commercial and recreational catch data. Catch data do not provide the species’ relative or absolute biomass, according to NMFS officials. For example, catch data alone is insufficient because fishermen are not randomly sampling the ocean but are fishing areas that they are allowed to fish and they believe have the most fish. fishing restrictions, such as a total allowable catch, can limit the amount of fish being caught. catch data have often been inaccurate for a variety of reasons, including imprecise accounting for dead fish tossed back into the ocean. data sources, four of the five assessments did not use NMFS survey data or the NMFS data used covered only a portion of the species’ habitats. In the yelloweye assessment, no NM FS survey data were available because yelloweye live almost exclusively in the rocky habitat that NMFS trawl surveys cannot cover. Bocaccio, canary, and darkblotched live in both the trawlable and untrawlable waters. As a result, theyelloweye assessment was based solely on non-NMFS data.  NMFS reported in 2003 that 77 percent of the survey area was trawlable and 23 percent was untrawlable. Lacking data on species in the 23 percent that is untrawl able, the assessors estimated the overall biomass using the NMFS data collected from the trawlability areas. However, the abundance in the trawlerable area is not representative of the abundance of species in untrawling waters. The 2003 NMFS report also found that darkblotched groundfish are less abundant in untrawled waters. untrawlable waters. NMFS does not have a standard process for evaluating whether the non-NMFS data used in its stock assessments are reliable. As a result, some rockfish populations may be understated while others may be overstated. We believe that certain internal control activities, such as aStandard process for ensuring data reliability, would be helpful to stock assessors and the public. The fifth groundfish species, Pacific hake, lives primarily in mid-water habitat; and so the concerns about the lack of NMFS data in rocky, untrawlable habitats are not applicable. Lacking a standard process, some assessors reviewed the quality of the raw non-NMFS data. Assessors who reviewed for data quality found mistakes that they believed made some of the data unusable or that could have impaired the accuracy of the stock assessments. For example, the assessor for the 2002 yelloweye stock assessment found numerous errors in the recreational catch data, such as attributing the catch from an entire fishing vessel to a single fisherman, and thus did not use the data. Commercial catch data frequently have inconsistencies. California, Oregon, and Washington require fishermen to enter catch and location information into logbooks, but logbooks are often incomplete and inaccurate. While the stock assessment review panels evaluated the assessments, the panels did not evaluate the quality of the raw data used in the assessments.doing so could have resulted in overestimating the biomass. According to a Northwest Center official, several assessors have raised concerns about data quality and accessibility in feedback meetings. In response to these concerns, the Northwest Center has recently begun. The Northwest Center plans to conduct a data quality workshop in July 2004 to formally establish the roles and responsibilities of the data stewards. Data stewards are responsible for helping assessors compile relevant data and for conducting quality assurance and quality control checks on the data. In 1998, the National Research Council recommended that NMFS include realistic measures of uncertainty in its stock assessments. NMFS’ 2001 stock assessment improvement plan also recognized the need to better quantify and communicate the data and its value to the community. The Northwest Center will conduct the workshop in June 2004. uncertainty in assessments. In a review of the 2002 canary assessment, the stock assessment review panel recommended that standard estimates of uncertainty be included in future assessments. However, the bocaccio, canary, darkblotched, and yelloweye assessments did not present a measure of uncertainty associated with the biomass estimates. Without uncertainty ranges, it is difficult for regional councils and NMFS to know how much confidence they have in their biomass estimates, the report says. It is difficult to determine the reliability of the stock Assessment without them. they can have in relying on the estimates for determining stock abundance and hence for setting allowable harvests of the fish. With such wide variations, it is important to provide uncertainty ranges, otherwise management may make inappropriate decisions. While assessors told us that their stock assessments included some information about differences in estimated biomass when using the estimates, they said they did not provide such information to the public. The 2003 assessment of bocaccio biomass, however, estimated 6,506 metric tons in 2002—more than doubling the previous estimate. different data sources (sensitivity analyses), the mathematical model that NMFS uses to estimate biomass does not calculate uncertainty ranges. NMFS is updating the model so that it can compute uncertainty ranges; NMFS expects to use the updated model for all 2005 stock assessments. The Pacific hake assessor used a mathematical model (AD Model Builder) that could compute uncertainty range and included these ranges in the Pacific haKE assessment report. NM FS has taken some steps recommended in the Marine Fisheries Stock Assessment Improvement Plan to improve the quantity, quality, and type of data. The Northwest Center has concentrated most of its efforts on implementing recommendations aimed at obtaining more data. Recommendations aimed at increasing the types of data and improving their quality have not yet been fully implemented for a variety of reasons, such as staffing and funding limitations. Other program priorities have precluded NMFS from implementing the recommendation to create a comprehensive plan that incorporates the improvement plan and related plans so that it can develop integrated program initiatives to improve stock, the report says. The report says much remains to be done to make the assessments more reliable. The October 2001 stock assessment improvement plan identified three scenarios (tiers) to consider when analyzing the resources needed to improve stock assessments. The three tiers of assessment improvements are as follows: Tier 1—improve stock assessments using existing data without initiating new data collection programs. Tier 2—conduct baseline monitoring of species, which in most cases requires sampling the species at least every 1 to 3 years. Tier 3—implement “next generation” stock assessments by explicitly incorporating ecosystem considerations and environmental effects in assessments. a number of recommendations to improve stock assessments. Data collection: Pursue new initiatives to expand data collection efforts. Communication: Educate constituents about NMFS’ strategies for improving stock assessment. Training:implement comprehensive training and staff development programs for NMFS' analytical and quantitative staff. Research: Develop partnerships and cooperative research programs with other entities, such as state agencies, commercial and recreational fishing organizations, and individuals to improve the quantity, quality, and type of data collected. The recommendations fall into the following four categories: improvement in the quantity of data collected for use in stocks assessments is a key component to achieving Tier 2 status. Northwest Center officials said that the quality of the data improves with more frequent surveys and more randomly selected survey locations. The assessments become more reliable because the data cover a longer period of time, producing better population trend information.interested in stock assessment science. Planning—develop integrated program initiatives by preparing a comprehensive plan that combines the improvement plan with its complementary plans.

The Northwest Center has concentrated most of its efforts on implementing improvements in data quantity. The surveys are now coastwide from Cape Flattery, Washington to the Mexican border, adding over 300 more miles along the southern California coast. The Northwest Center now participates in NMFS’ National Sea Grant program to augment a Northwest Center-supported graduate study program at the University of Washington. Efforts continue to communicate the strategies needed to improve stock assessments and to augment existing programs aimed at developing future stock assessment scientists. NMFS to better integrate and coordinate program initiatives for improving stock assessments. According to NMFS funding and budget requests, the Northwest Center needs at least $8.9 million to complete ongoing and planned improvements. The Northwest Center did not receive its full funding request, in part, because NMFS did not get all the funding it had requested. NMFS is now updating its plan for improving Pacific groundfish stock assessments using key findings from its December 2003 review of the groundfish program. The updated groundfish research plan should be completed in late 2004 or early 2005. reliable assessments, fishery managers may reach erroneous conclusions and take actions that could adversely affect the fishing industry economically. Without a comprehensive, integrated improvement plan, funding requests and planned actions to improve the stock assessments may not be coordinated, jeopardizing successful and timely implementation of improvements. Continue efforts to collect more types of data, such as data obtained from surveys in rocky, untrawlable waters, recruitment surveys, and ecosystem studies, for groundfish assessments where reliable data are now lacking. Establish a standard approach that requires that non-NMFS data used in stock assessments be evaluated for its reliability. GAO: We conducted our review from May 2003 through April 2004 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We did not simulate NMFS’ stock assessment models nor evaluate the mathematical and statistical methodologies used in the models for Pacific hake, bocaccio, canary, darkblotched, and yelloweye. We found NMFS does not check or have a standard process to verify that these data have been reviewed for reliability. For these reasons, we did not change the report. GAO: reliability of the five assessments we reviewed is questionable and could easily be misconstrued to mean all these assessments are an unreliable basis for management of the west coast groundfish fishery. NOAA: The five assessments GAO reviewed all passed scientific review and are serving as the basis for formal status determination and fishery management. We believe the Pacific hake biomass estimates are questionable because the assessment used non-NMFS data that NMFS did not check or subject to standard data reliability testing. We added clarification to the report to show that stock assessments are a key tool for managing fisheries and are important in making decisions about setting harvest levels.

Summary:
CMS reported total obligations for CMS contracts in fiscal year 2008 were $3.6 billion. This amount includes obligations against contracts that process Medicare claims. Obligations for other- than-claims processing activities, such as the 1-800 Medicare help line, are also included in the total. Since 1998, obligations to fiscal intermediaries, carriers, and Medicare Administrative Contractors have decreased approximately 16 percent. The $3 million obligated in 2008 represents a 71 percent increase since 1998, when $2.1 billion was obligated. 1-800 help line, information technology and financial management initiatives, and program management and consulting services, have increased 466 percent. These trends may be explained in part by recent changes to the Medicare program. MMA required CMS to transition its Medicare claims processing contracts, which generally did not follow Medicare claims. These specialized contractors, such as beneficiary contact center contractors and enterprise data center contractors, are categorized below as other-than-claims processing contractors, as shown in figure 1. services such as data centers, and certain financial management activities, have moved from fiscal intermediaries and carriers to specialized contractors. the FAR, to the FAR environment through the award of contracts to Medicare Administrative Contractors. CMS projected that the transition, referred to as Medicare contracting reform, would produce administrative cost savings due to the effects of competition and contract consolidation. The transition would subject millions of dollars of CMS acquisitions to the rules, standards, and requirements for the award, administration, and termination of government contracts in the FAR. Obligations to the new Medicare administrative Contractors were first made in fiscal year 2009-10. CMS is required to complete Medicare contracting reform by 2011. As of September 1, 2009, 19 contracts have been awarded to Medicare Administrative Contractors, totaling about $1 billion in obligations to date. Except for certain Medicare claims processing contracts, CMS contracts are generally required to be awarded and administered in accordance with general government procurement laws and regulations. OAGM manages contracting activities and is responsible for, among other things, developing policy and administering contracts. The Office of Government Contracting Management (OAGM) was established in 2007. All but one of the key roles described below are managed centrally in OAGM. The last, project officers, are assigned from CMS program offices. Contracting officers are responsible for ensuring performance of all necessary actions for effective contracting. They are also responsible for overseeing contractor compliance with the terms of the contract, and safeguarding the interests of the government in its contractual relationships. The contracting officer is responsible for negotiating, award, administration, and termination of contracts. The contract officer is the person in charge of negotiating, awarding, and terminating contracts. officer is authorized to enter into, modify, and terminate contracts. Contract specialists represent and assist the contracting officers with the contract, but are generally not authorized to commit or bind the government. The cost/price team serves as an in-house consultant to others involved in the contracting process at CMS. By request, the team, which consists of four contract auditors, provides support for contract administration including contract administration, procurement and other areas of the government’s business.

Project officers serve as the contracting officer's technical representative designated to monitor the contractor’s progress. According to OAGM invoice review policy, project officers review certain invoice elements, such as labor and direct costs, and are required to certify whether the invoice is approved for payment by signing a Payments and Progress Certification Form. They may also conduct periodic analyses of contractor performance and cost data. The PRISM database contains basic information such as contract number, vendor name, and amount obligated. The Enhanced Departmental Contracts Information System (DCIS) is used for department-level acquisition management. DCIS collects and forwards information to the Federal Procurement Data System Next Generation (FPDS-NG), which is a publicly available database of governmentwide acquisition information. Likewise, FPDS- NG feeds into www.usaspending.gov, a Web site created by the Department of Homeland Security. Agencies may choose among different contract types to acquire goods and services. Contract types can be grouped into three broad categories: fixed price contracts, cost reimbursement contracts, and time and materials (T&M) contracts. The government assumes most of the cost risk because the contractor is only required to provide its best effort to meet contract objectives within the estimated cost. For T&M contracts, the government agrees to pay fixed per-hour labor rates and to reimburse other costs directly related to the contract. Government provide framework for establishing and maintaining internal control. Management should establish both a supportive overall control environment and specific control activities. A positive control environment provides discipline and structure as well as a climate supportive of quality internal control, and includes an assessment of the risks of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. It also includes an environment that sets a positive and supportive attitude towards control and conscientious management. For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or see www.samaritans.org.  control activities are the policies, procedures, techniques, and mechanisms that enforce management’s directives and help ensure that actions are taken to address risks. The standards provide that information should be recorded and communicated to management and oversight officials in a form and within a time frame that enables them to carry out their responsibilities. An entity should have internal control monitoring activities in place to assess the quality of performance over time and ensure that the findings of audits and other reviews are promptly resolved. Control activities include both external and internal sources. preventive and detective controls. Preventive controls are controls designed to prevent errors, improper payments, or waste. Detective controls are designed to identify errors or improper payments after the payment is made. A sound system of internal control contains a balance of both preventive and Detective controls that is appropriate for the agency’s operations. For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch, or see www.samaritans.org for details. In the U.S. call the National Suicide Prevention Line on 1-800-273-8255. of improper payments or waste before they occur. A key concept introduced in our standards is that control activities selected for implementation be cost beneficial. A control activity can be preventive, detective, or both based on when the control occurs in the contract life cycle. We found pervasive deficiencies in internal control over contracting and payments to contractors. The internal control deficiencies occurred throughout the contracting process, that is both pre- and post-award, and increase the risk of improper payments. These deficiencies were due in part to a lack of agency-specific policies and procedures to ensure that FAR requirements and other control objectives were met. CMS also did not take appropriate steps to. ensure that existing policies were properly implemented nor maintain. adequate documentation in its contract files. The Contract Review Board was not effective in ensuring proper contract award actions. These internal control deficiencies are a manifestation of CMS’s weak overall control environment, which is discussed later. As a result of our work, we estimate that at least 84.3 percent of FAR- based contract actions made by CMS in fiscal year 2008 contained at least. at least one of these deficiencies. one instance in which a key control was not adequately implemented. Many contract actions had more than one deficiency. At least 37.2 percent of FAR-based contract actions made in fiscal year 2008 had three or more instances of not being implemented. The controls ranged from ensuring contractors had adequate accounting systems prior to the use of a cost reimbursement contract to certifying invoices for payment. The U.S. Air Force is one of the largest military contractors in the world, with more than 1,000 employees. The high percentage of deficiencies indicates a serious failure of control procedures over FAR-based acquisitions. This creates a heightened risk of making improper payments or waste. We determined a control to be “key” based on our review of the standards for internal control as well as the FAR, HHSAR, and agency policies. We also took into consideration prior audit findings and the contract types CMS most frequently used. See appendix I for additional details on the controls we tested and the statistical sample results. the results of our statistical sample conservatively by reporting the lower bound of our two-sided, 95 percent confidence interval. The control deficiencies we found were primarily caused by a lack of agency-specific policies and procedures that would help ensure that applicable FAR requirements, agency policies, and other control objectives were met. CMS did not always meet FAR requirements for specific contract types that were awarded, nor maintain adequate support for approved provisional indirect cost rates. The agency did not timely perform or request audits of incurred direct costs. At least 46.0 percent of fiscal year 2008 CMS contract actions did not meet the FAR requirements applicable to the specific contract type awarded. Of the contract awards in our sample, we found 9 cases in which cost reimbursement contracts were used without first ensuring that the contractor had an adequate accounting system. For 17 contract actions that utilized indirect cost rates, CMS did not have documentation supporting what would be the appropriate provisional indirect cost rate for the contractor. For an additional 19 contract actions, the provisional rates either did not match the indirect rates billed on the invoices or could not be matched because the invoice did not provide sufficient detail. final indirect cost rates or support for the prompt request of an audit of indirect costs. The amounts a contractor billed using provisional indirect cost Rates are adjusted annually for final indirect cost Rate. Final indirect cost rate rates are generally negotiated by the government’s negotiating team that includes the government. The FAR states that final indirect costs rates are based on the actual indirect costs incurred during a given fiscal year, shall be used in reimbursing indirect costs under cost reimbursement contracts. It provides a mechanism for the government to timely ensure that indirect costs are allowable and allocable to the contract. the CFA following an audit of a statement of incurred costs submitted by the contractor. CMS officials told us that they generally adjust for final indirect cost rates during contract closeout at the end of the contract performance rather than annually due to the cost and effort the adjustment takes. When CMS is not the CFA, CMS must wait on the C FA to perform the necessary audit work required to establish the final indirect Cost Rates. Not annually adjusting for final direct cost rates increases the risk that CMS will not be able to meet its obligations. CMS is paying for costs that are not allowable or allocable to the contract. Putting off the control activity until the end of contract performance increases the risk of overpaying for indirect costs during contract performance. We estimate that for at least 54.9 percent of fiscal year 2008 contract actions, CMS did not promptly perform or request an audit of direct costs. We found that 25 contract actions for which this control applied did not have an audit. It may make identification or recovery of any unallowable costs duringcontract closeout more difficult due to the passage of time. of direct costs promptly performed or requested. Similar to the audit of indirect costs, audits of direct costs allow the government to verify that the costs billed by the contractor were allowable, reasonable, and allocable to the contract. The audit ofdirect costs is the responsibility of the contracting officer. The contracting officer may request, for a fee, that the CFA for the contractor perform the audit work. The FAR does not provide time frames or other requirements for when the audit should be performed except that such an audit may be necessary for closing out a contract. CMS had policies for invoice certification and purchase card oversight. These policies were not consistently followed. Not annually auditing direct costs increases the risk that CMS is paying for costs that are not allowable or allocable to the contract. The failure to follow established agency policy increases CMS’s risk of improperly paying contractor invoices or purchase card transactions, the report says. The report also found two instances where the contractor billed, and CMS paid, this cost. The total value of the contract through January 2009 was about $64 million. did not perform required audits and reviews of CMS purchase cards to identify fraud or waste. As of July 15, 2009, OAGM’s purchase card program had issued 123 cards with 20 percent having monthly spending limits of at least $50,000. Eight card holders had monthly spending limit of $100,000, the highest spending limit authorized by CMS. CMS does not have assurance that only allowable transactions are procured through purchase cards and that the purchase cards are not being used. HHS purchase card policy guidance provides that the purchase card coordinator, which at CMS is within OAGM, is required to conduct surveillance of the program. We spoke with an OAGC supervisor who said the agency did not perform the oversight activities because the supervisor viewed those activities as the responsibility of the Office of Financial Management (OFM) The supervisor also said that the agency was not required to monitor cardholder transactions using such methods as statistical and nonstatistical sampling, data mining, and spot checks.to circumvent FAR competition requirements. OFM does not review purchase card transactions for fraud or inappropriate use, but instead pays the purchase card invoice based on the authorizing official’s approval. Standards for internal control call for transactions and other significant events to be clearly documented, and the documentation should be readily available for examination. In addition, the FAR provides that the documentation in the contract files shall be sufficient to constitute a complete history. During the tests of control procedures, we observed that the contracts did not always contain all required documentation to support the contract actions we reviewed. of the contract action for the purpose of providing a basis for informed decisions at each step in the acquisition process, and providing information for reviews and investigations. Incomplete or inadequate contract files and documentation hinder the ability of the contracting officers to perform their oversight duties, especially those who assume responsibility for contracts that have changed hands. Clearly documenting the history of a contract action is an important tool that provides management with assurance that the agency has complied with applicable regulations and has made well-informed decisions for efficient contract management. contract. CMS contract files did not always contain documentation necessary to support the action. In numerous instances, we determined that the letter delegating duties to the project officer and the project manager was not properly written. In addition, two contract files. did not maintain any information regarding the General Services Administration schedule contract. that was valid at the time of the award of the task order. We found a contract file was missing a statement of work and another file wasMissing a copy of the actual contract. training certificate for the project officer were not in the file. Also, a chronological list of contracting officers and their dates of responsibility was consistently absent. CMS’s use of negotiation memorandums was inconsistent, the report said. The HHSAR provides that the negotiation memorandum is a complete record of all actions leading to the award of a contract, according to the report. It should be in sufficient detail to explain and support the rationale, judgments, and authorities upon which all actions were predicated, it said. be signed by the contract negotiator. However, negotiation memorandums were not always prepared for actions in which they were clearly required, according to HHSAR. While many negotiation Memorandums we reviewed had signature blocks for both the contract specialist and the contracting officer (generally the preparer and reviewer, respectively), the memorandum was not always signed. CMS’s OAGM established the Contract Review Board (CRB) reviews as a key control procedure to help ensure contract award actions are in conformance with law. policies and procedures, and sound business practices. Our review of the CRB process found that the process had not been properly or fully implemented. For example, of the 22 contracts selected to be reviewed by theCRB in 2008, only 7 were actually reviewed. For fiscal year 2009, 22 contracts were selected but only 2 have been reviewed as of the end of the third quarter. Also, the contracting officer for the contract action being reviewed is neither required to reach consensus on the resolution of issues identified nor to document the resolution. OAGM’s policies require that all contracts above $10 million be subjected to the CRB. CMS confirmed that only contracts nominated by division directors are reviewed. CMS policies do not require issues to be resolved and documented and because CMS is not fully implementing theCRB, opportunities to resolve CRB issues may be missed. If used correctly, the CRb can be an effective tool for risk-based quality assurance and for reviewing the internal controls throughout the contract award and administration process. CMS’s FAR-based contract management was impaired by a weak control environment. Staff resources allocated to contract oversight had not kept pace with the increase in CMS contract awards. A shortage of human resources creates an environment that hinders the contracting process. CMS has not yet determined the amount of total FTEs needed for the fiscal year and beyond.. Using contractors for contract administrative functions may increase the risk of establishing unauthorized personal services contracts or of contractors performing inherently governmental functions, both of which are prohibited by FAR. The acquisition data errors are due in part to a lack of sufficient quality assurance activities over the data entered into the acquisition databases. Without accurate data, CMS program managers do not have adequate information to identify and monitor areas that pose a high risk of improper payments or waste. The errors in DCIS, including the unrecorded actions, also impact governmentwide reporting. Only two of GAO’s nine 2007 recommendations had been fully addressed by CMS in 2009, the GAO found in its assessment of the contracting process. Roles and responsibilities for implementation of CFA responsibilities not clearly defined. HHS officials said that they did not have a process to identify the contractors, including CMS contractors, for which HHS would be the CFA. CMS policies did not provide guidance on what constitutes sufficient detail to support amounts billed on contractor invoices to facilitate the review process. Without effective coordination, contractors may not receive the necessary oversight and the government may not be positioned to protect itself from the risk of improper payments or waste. CMS has not set criteria for the use of negative certification. Reviewing invoices prior to payment is a preventive control. We found that OAGM’s invoice review policy was too lax. We recommended that CMS establish criteria for when to use negative certification, such as considerations of potential risk factors such as contract type, the adequacy of the contractor�s accounting system, and prior history with the contractor. The committee found that CMS’ invoice review policies were too lax and that the review process was not sufficiently rigorous. was not revised to address this recommendation and OAGM officials confirmed that negative certification is still the primary method for paying invoices regardless of risks. Training on invoice review procedures still needed. As discussed earlier, project officers did not always certify invoice for approval and contracting officers or specialists did not often identify instances where invoiced did not comply with contract terms and conditions. We also found that invoICES were not always maintained in the file, as required by CMS’s invoice review policy. CMS did not timely perform contract closeout procedures resulting in a backlog of 1,300 contracts, of which 407 were overdue for closeout as of September 30, 2007. We recommended that CMS develop a plan to reduce the number of contracts in the backlog. CMS did not provide us a closeout plan for fiscal year 2008 and the fiscal year 2009 plan was insufficient. Specifically, the plan did not include a comprehensive strategy to reduction the backlog of contracts.described above, further training on invoice review procedures will be necessary. contracts that are eligible and overdue for closeout nor did it contain a workload analysis. The FAR establishes time standards for closing out a contract after the work is physically completed. The contract closeout process is an important internal control, in part, because it is generally the last opportunity for the government to detect and recover any improper payments. The complexity and the cost of closing out contracts can be difficult to estimate, according to the government's contract review process, which can take up to a year. length of the closeout process can vary with the extent of oversight performed by the agency during the period of performance and the contract type. CMS officials told us that during fiscal year 2008, OAGM closed 581 contracts and reduced the overdue backlog to 400 contracts (from the 407 reported at the end of fiscal year 2007) Yet O AGM officials could not provide support for these closures or a list of the contracts overdue for closeout. As of July 29, 2009, the total backlog of contracts eligible forcloseout was 1,611, with 594 overdue. The total contract value of contracts eligible for closeout has increased from $3 billion to at least $3.8 billion. This is a substantial increase over the balances at the end of fiscal year 2007. The closeout process is particularly important for cost reimbursement contracts because a contractor is allowed to bill costs it incurred to provide the good or service. The government audits these billed costs to determine if they were allowable and allocable to the contract, the report says. It says insufficient progress has been made to reduce the backlog of contracts. and processes the final invoice with an adjustment for any over- or underpayments. The failure to perform contract closeouts in a timely manner puts CMS at increased risk of improper payments or waste, and may make identification and recovery of any such improper payments more difficult due to the passage of time. CMS has not taken sufficient actions to investigate and recover questionable payments. CMS described several actions it has taken to investigate payments made to 3 of the 12 contractors for which we identified questionable payments, but they are insufficient to fully resolve the problem. issues identified and more remains to be done to recover funds that may have been inappropriately paid to contractors. CMS relies on incurred cost audits that are conducted at the end of contract performance when the contract is closed to validate the overall propriety of payments. CMS’s backlog of contracts eligible for closeout delays investigations and makes recovery more difficult. CMS does not track, investigate, and resolve contract audit and evaluation findings for purposes of cost recovery and future award decisions. We found no evidence of any plans or procedures that would mitigate the identified risks. internal controls that are and can be instituted by agencies to help safeguard assets, prevent and detect fraud and errors. As described in appendix I, we selected 11 controls that we determined to be “key” based on GAO’s standards for internal control, the FAR and HHSAR. CMS stated its belief that “virtually all” of the errors we identified related to “perceived documentation deficiencies.” “Virtually all,” is the key word. CMS stated it was encouraged that the errors we found did not involve more substantive departures from the FAR or HHSAR. A number of the findings we identified during the testing of a statistically valid sample of contract files involved the lack of documentation that the controls were performed. Lack of documentation reduces management’s ability to ascertain whether these important controls were appropriately implemented. The internal controls we tested are key to ensuring that contracting activities, both pre and post-award, mitigate risks to the federal government. OAGM management’s downplaying of the overall message of the report—that control deficiencies are pervasive—further illustrates the weak internal control environment. Setting an appropriate control environment, especially “tone at the top,” is key to ensuring that staff take all appropriate steps to mitigate risk and protect tax dollars from fraud, waste, and abuse. CMS also stated that a reasonable amount of time had not yet elapsed since the issuance of our November 2007 report to allow for corrective actions to have taken place. A significant number of our current report findings, including weaknesses in the system, are a serious internal control deficiency. in the control environment, were based on observations and interviews with OAGM officials and reviews of related documentation such as policies and strategic plans. Our current review was completed in September 2009, nearly 2 years after the issuance of our November 2007 report. While CMS also stated that the contract actions we reviewed took place in fiscal year 2008, it is important to note that we considered the timing of CMS’s corrective actions when evaluating the controls we tested. For example, CMS�s Acquisition Policy 02-03, which identifies level of approvals required by agency officials based on the estimated dollar value. for acquisitions awarded through other than full and open competition, was implemented in April 2008. We applied these approval levels only to the awards and modifications in our sample that were made after the policy was implemented. CMS disagreed with our determination that their actions to address five of the seven prior recommendations were not sufficient. These prior recommendationswere aimed at improving preventive controls. Preventive controls, such as policies and criteria for pre-award activities and a sound invoice, are important to CMS’s control environment. review process prior to payment, are the first line of defense in reducing the risk of improper payments or waste. We continue to believe that the limited actions OAGM management has taken, and in some cases, management’s inaction, fall short of expectations. CMS asserted that its Acquisition Policy 16-01 entitled “Invoicing Payment Procedures” satisfies two of the prior recommendations. The intent of these two recommendations was to ensure that contractors provided adequate support to facilitate an appropriate detailed review of the invoiced costs. CMS uses negative certification to ensure invoices are paid in a timely fashion. CMS did not provide the recommended additional guidelines on what the contractor should provide that would constitute sufficient detail to support amounts billed. CMS had taken some action, but the steps have not resolved the questionable payments we identified, we found. We revised our assessment of the status of efforts taken by CMS from “No Actions Taken” to “Actions Insufficient.’“We found it to be unresponsive to the recommendations," the report said. highlighted $67 million that we previously questioned that was related to one specific contractor. These questionable payments are being investigated via a fiscal year 2008 incurred cost audit. We continue to believe that CMS’s actions to date are insufficient and more actions need to be taken. As of the date of the report, CMS could not tell us whether it had recovered any of the questioned amounts. The $67million we questioned related to costs incurred in fiscal years 2004, 2005, and 2006 and therefore would not be covered or investigated in an audit of fiscal Year 2008 incurred costs. are needed to investigate and recover the questionable payments we identified. No other changes were made to the report as a result of agency comments. See appendix III for a discussion of the remaining two prior recommendations (points 2, 3, and 4) for which CMS disagreed with our assessment of its progress. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its date. At that time, we will send copies to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and interested congressional committees. Copies will also be available to others on request. Report will be available at no charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-9095 or dalykl@gao,gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs are found on the last page of this report. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented effective internal control procedures over contract actions. We focused on contracts that were generally subjected to the Federal Acquisition Regulation. We interviewed senior management of CMS’s Office of Acquisition and Grants Management (OAGM), contracting officers and specialists, and cost/price team members. We selected 11 internal controls over contracting and payments to contractors to test for this report, ranging from ensuring contractors had adequate accounting systems prior to the use of them. a cost reimbursement contract to certifying invoices for payment. We selected controls to test based on our review of GAO’s standards for internal control, the Federal Acquisition Regulation requirements, and agency policies and procedures. The controls we tested are key to effective administration of the contract in that the lack of implementation would significantly increase the risk of improper payments or waste. To test internal control procedures over contract actions, we selected a stratified random sample of 102 contract actions totaling $140.7 million in fiscal year 2008. obligations from a population of 2,441 contract actions totaling $2.5 billion in fiscal year 2008 obligations. We stratified the contract actions by type of action, namely contract awards and contract modifications, recorded in CMS’s PRISM database from October 1, 2007, through September 30, 2008. With this probability sample, each contract action in the sample frame had a non- zero probability of being included and that probability could be computed from any contract action. Each stratum was subsequently weighted in the analysis to account statistically for. all the contract actions in the sample frame, including those that were not selected. Results from this statistical sample were projected to the population of contract actions made from October 1, 2007, through September 30, 2008. We also obtained information from agency officials regarding contract closeout, cognizant federal agency responsibilities, audit funding, and staff resources. See table 2 for specific details related to contract actions selected in the Sample. sample item. Table 3 provides further details on the control procedures we tested and the criteria or source for the procedure. basis for our evaluation of CMS’s contract management control environment. We determined that only basic contract information maintained in the PRISM database, such as vendor name and obligation amount, was reliable for purposes of this study. We used a statistically random sample selected to test the application of controls to also test the accuracy of the data in the systems. We assessed the reliability of the databases by performing electronic testing of required data elements and interviewing both CMS and HHS officials on quality assurance activities performed on the databases. of this report. The historical obligation amounts presented in the background section of the report come primarily from CMS’s PRISM database. We requested comments on a draft of this report from HHS and CMS. We received written comments on October 2, 2009, and have summarized those comments in the Agency Comments and Our Evaluation section ofthis report. Our response to certain specific CMS comments appears in the GAO Comments section of appendix III. We conducted this performance audit in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reported that the policy and criteria for pre-award contracting activities are already established in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service’s (CMS) actions are unresponsive to the recommendation. Neither HHS nor CMS has developed policies that clearly define key areas of authority and duties for the CFA responsibilities. HHS reported that they have implemented the Acquisition Career Management Information System (ACMIS) ACMIS is a centralized tracking mechanism that maintains training records for the personnel assigned to contract activities.

Summary:
The 105 th Congress held several hearings and introduced many bills to address this issue, but adjourned without passing legislation. No legislation addressing slamming was introduced in either the 107 th or 108 th Congress and none has been introduced in the 109 th Congress, to date. The potential for slamming is expected to increase as competition in the provision of intrastate long distance and local telecommunications services becomes more widespread. The FCC's slamming team, which is part of the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau, in 2004 resolved approximately 3,500 slamming complaints involving over 300 telephone carriers. The FCC has taken slamming enforcement actions totaling nearly $30 million. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 expanded the scope of the FCC's authority to address the problem of unauthorized switches. The rules absolve slammed consumers of liability for charges incurred for the first 30 days after the switch. The FCC continues to take enforcement actions against violators of FCC rules.. Charges are set at 150 percent, split between the authorized carrier (100%) and the subscriber (50%). Carriers proven to be in violation of FCC Rules are subject to fines and penalties. The FCC has also applied verification procedures to the practice of implementing carrier freeze requests. The rules require that solicitations for such freezes be clear and that the consumer be informed as to how such a freeze may be lifted. Verification rules are also applied to changes in local as well as long distance carriers, but wireless carriers are exempt. The FCC also noted that these verification procedures do not preempt state law. These verification methods are to be used as a state minimum, the FCC said in a statement. AT&T v. FCC found that the FCC exceeded its statutory authority in enforcing certain of its slamming rules relating to customer verification. While not remanding the FCC's rules the court did vacate fines totaling $80,000 imposed on AT&T. But additional verification procedures may be adopted for intrastate carrier changes. The FCC had imposed a fine on AT & T for slamming when an unauthorized person, without the knowledge of the line subscriber, authorized to slam the phone. But the court found that this was not the case and vacated the fine. The court found that the requirement that the telecommunications carrier verify that the actual subscriber, and not just the person answering the line and claiming to have authority to authorize a carrier switch, authorize the switch exceeded the FCC's statutory authority. The court stated that the statue does not require actual authorization but only requires that the carrier get verification. Furthermore the court said that the FCC gives carriers "a virtually impossible task: guaranteeing that the person who answers the telephone is in fact authorized to make changes to that phone line" telephone line." On March 17, 2003, the FCC issued a second further notice of proposed rulemaking (CC Docket 94-129; FCC 03-42) strengthening requirements on third-party verification procedures. These rules became effective July 21, 2003. New initiatives are established to ease the filing of consumer complaints and speed their resolution. These include the establishment of a website to allow consumers to file complaints electronically and obtain on-line consumer protection information. The FCC also established a toll-free number at the FCC to enable consumers tofile complaints over the telephone. The FCC has also adopted rules that establish truth-in-billing and billing format principles. These rules establish requirements that are "intended to protect consumers against inaccurate and unfair billing practices" A number of issues not addressed in the April 13, 2000 reconsideration order were addressed in a subsequent FCC order adopted on July 21, 2000. These include permitting the use of Internet LOAs in compliance with provisions of the FCC rules. The rules went into effect on April 2, 2001, and are intended to improve the resolution of complaints. contained in the E-Sign Act ( P.L. 106-229 ), thereby allowing carrier changes to be made by consumers via the Internet. retaining the three-way call as a verification method but requiring the carrier's sales representative to drop off the call once the connection has been established between the subscriber and the third party verifier. New complaint reporting requirements for carriers which require carriers to submit semiannual reports to the FCC's Enforcement Bureau containing, among other information, the number of slamming complaints they have received. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), (known at that time as the General Accounting Office), undertook an investigation into the general issue of slamming. This report, Telephone Slamming and Its Harmful Effects , was released in conjunction with testimony given at Subcommittee hearings. The Fletcher Companies, a long distance provider that has come under regulatory scrutiny, and has since had its license revoked, for slamming complaints. By changing their names, the companies were able to avoid scrutiny. The GAO report was released at the request of Senator Collins, then Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. GAO: FCC, states, and telecommunications industry have been effective in protecting the consumer from telephone slamming. GAO: Information provided by all long distance carriers in compliance with FCC-required tariff filing procedures, is not reviewed and is no deterrent to a slammer. The most effective action that consumers can take to eliminate the chance of intentional slamming is to have their local exchange carrier freeze their choice of long distance providers. The conclusions reached in the GAO report regarding FCC efforts to deter slamming were discussed during hearings held, on April 23, 1998, by the Senate Permanent Investigations Subcommittee. Slamming is the practice of placing unauthorized charges for services and products on a consumer's telephone bill. The 105 th Congress examined this issue, with each chamber passing its version of legislation to protect consumers against slamming. Legislation to strengthen existing slamming regulations was again introduced in the 106 th Congress but was not enacted. No slamming measures were introduced in either the 107 th or 108 th Congress nor in the 109 th Congress, to date. Whether the FCC's strengthened slamming rules and subsequent enforcement actions will be a sufficient deterrent to stop the practice is unclear. The "Consumer Anti-Slamming Act of 1998" ( S. 1618 ), passed the Senate (99-0) with amendment, on May 12, 1998. The bill prohibited long distance carriers and resellers from changing a subscriber's long distance provider without the subscriber's explicit permission. The use of negative option marketing, whereby a consumer must take some action to prevent a switch from occurring, was banned. The FCC was given the authority to prosecute those who refuse to pay their fines. FCC was required to review the code every two years to ensure that its requirements "adequately protect consumers" Each carrier was given 10 days within adoption of the code, or commencement of operation, to elect to comply with the voluntary code. Those telecommunications carriers, including resellers, that elected not to comply, were to be subject to presumably more stringent FCC regulations. H.R. 3888 also detailed specific, more stringent, minimum requirements to be incorporated into FCC-developed regulations for carriers not operating under the voluntaryCode. The FCC was also required to compile and publish a report, on a semiannual basis, ranking carriers by the percentage of verified complaints, excluding those generated by the carrier's unaffiliated resellers. Carriers listed among the five worst performers for three consecutive times were to be subject to FCC investigation. Carrier found in violation of the voluntary code or found willfully and repeatedly slamming were subject to a fine of up to $1 million. The FCC has not commented on the new rules, which are expected to be implemented in the coming months. H.R. 3888 was passed by the House Commerce Committee and ultimately the full House. It gives state attorneys general enforcement authority under the federal legislation. The bill also gives subscribers credit for charges incurred when using the slamming carrier's service. It directs the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration to report to Congress on "the feasibility and desirability" of establishing a neutral third party to administer a system to prevent slamming. It was significantly different from the subcommittee-passed version of the bill. H.R. 3888 contained a significantly different approach to combat slamming from its Senate counterpart, S. 1618. Negotiations between the House and Senate to reconcile differences between the two measures continued through the waning days of the session. Despite such efforts, however, H.R.-3888 was not brought to the Senate floor and legislation to address slamming was not enacted prior to the adjournment of the 105 th Congress. The telecommunications industry has acknowledged the existence of a slamming problem but is not necessarily in agreement. The Competitive Telecommunications Association (CompTel) issued a statement that called for "zero tolerance" of intentional slamming. CompTel urged carriers to agree to investigate all slamming allegations, repay consumers who have been the victims of slamming, and terminate any employees or agents who "knowingly and willfully engaged in such practices" The statement also advocated uniformity in state and federal slamming requirements, to lessen consumer confusion, and called for the levying of fines, but solely in cases where it has been proven necessary. proven that the carrier "has engaged in willful and intentional slamming...." Although virtually no one supports the practice of intentional slamming, some concerns have been expressed over the approaches being taken to curb this practice. One concern has focused on the necessity for, or concern over specific provisions contained in, legislative proposals. Two other concerns addressed in legislation have also generated controversy: the implementation of primary interexchange carrier (PIC) freeze programs; and the methodology used by the FCC to develop slamming statistics. FCC: PIC freeze is a viable option to prevent slamming in the long distance market. Concerns have been expressed over the potential for misuse of this option. FCC established safe harbors of $1.25 for electronically-processed PIC changes and $5.50 for manually processed P IC changes. Local exchange carriers can charge more if they can document higher costs and less than the safe harbor rate if they choose. Some feel that potential for abuse of the PIC Freeze will become greater. from carrier to carrier and that many of the potential and perceived abuses, such as high charges or difficultly in switching, do not apply to most programs. Many local exchange carriers claim that they do not actively market the PIC freeze option but only offer it in response to customers who complain about slamming or who specifically inquire about it. The methodology used by the FCC to develop slamming statistics has also been brought under question. The GAO criticized the methodology used to determine the list of top slamming offenders. The FCC compares slamming offenders by citing the ratio of the number of complaints per million dollars of company revenue. That methodology, according to the GAO, is flawed because it can lead to a severe understatement of the revenue-to-complaint ratio for the smaller companies, or resellers. This occurs because resellers are not required to, and generally do not, report their revenue to the FCC unless the revenue exceeds $109 million. To enable the FCC to make comparisons, to list the top slamming offenders, the FCC assumes that those resellers that have not provided revenue data, had revenues of $109 million. LCI International Inc., a long distance carrier in the United States, has also expressed concern over the manner in which the FCC calculates yearly slamming rates. Unlike the GAO, LCI claims that the FCC's current practice of dividing the number of slamming complaints by a company's annual telecommunications revenue favors larger carriers. This occurs,LCI states, because the larger the company, the more complaints it receives. a company's revenue the more consumers it can slam without appearing to be a major offender. LCI recommends that the FCC calculate its slamming rate ratio by dividing the number of slamming complaints by theNumber of new long distance customers.

Summary:
The IG Act created independent IG offices at 30 major departments and agencies with IGs appointed by the President, confirmed by the Senate. In 1988, the IG Act was amended to establish additional IG offices located in 33 DFEs defined by the act. The presidentially appointed IGs and the DFE IGs reported to us total budget authority for fiscal year 2010 of about $2.2 billion. Although not in the scope of our review, there are 10 IGs established by other statutes with provisions similar to those in the IG act. GAO obtained information on the accomplishments of the IGs as reported to the IG Council for fiscal year 2009. We also obtained information reported by the Recovery Board on its mission and accomplishments in providing oversight of Recovery Act funds. The IGs reported pay that was at the specified levels required by the Reform Act for IGs appointed by the President and consistent with those of other senior- level officials as required for DFE IGs. We believe that the information and data obtained, and the analysis conducted, provide a reasonable basis for any findings and conclusions. and 2010. Only one, a presidentially appointed IG, had used the 7-day letter during this time frame. On May 6, 2009, the IG delivered a report to the acting head under the IG Act provisions for a 7- day letter. The IG’s report gained the interest of congressional members and the issues were resolved by the President. The report was provided to the chairmen of numerous congressional committees on May 12, 2009. It was within the7-day time frame for the IG to deliver the report. Generally, issues have been resolved more informally before getting to the point of using a 7-day letter. Provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act amending the IG Act are intended to provide an additional degree of oversight. In 1999 we reported that no IGs had used the 7- day letter during the period of January 1990 through April 1998. In 1988, the House Committee on Government Operations in 1988 found that the IGs viewed the use of the 7 day letter as a last resort to force appropriate action by the agency. The Dodd-Frank Act requires two-thirds of the members of these DFE boards and commissions for the removal or transfer of their IGs. Twenty-six of the 33 DFE IGs are in DFEs with boards or commissions. Of these 26 IGs, 14 reported that the act’s provision that the head of the DFE with a board or commission is no longer subject to the judgment of a single individual was not applied to them. The act also requires the written concurrence of two- thirds of the member of these boards. designating the boards and commissions as the DFE heads enhances their independence, and 20 responded that their independence is enhanced by requiring a two-thirds majority for their removal. A smaller number of affected IGs stated that these provisions had no effect on their independence. One DFE IG affected by the provisions did not respond to these survey questions. Also, a former D FE IG stated that reporting to his commission would reduce his independence, according to the survey. The survey was carried out by the European Commission. because the commission has both federal and state members. The current IG who took office during our review stated that the primary concern is how nonfederal members would exercise their authority over a federal IG. The Reform Act amended the IG Act to require that IG budget requests include certain information and be separately identified in the President’s budget submission to the Congress. In addition, along with the separately identified IG budgets, the IGs may include comments with respect to the budget if the amount of the IG budget submitted by the agency or the President would substantially inhibit. the IG from performing the duties of the office. These budget provisions are intended to help ensure adequate funding and additional independence of IG budgets. One presidentially appointed IG office was newly established and not included in the full fiscal year 2011 budget process. However another IG subject to these budget provisions was not included. The fiscal year2011 budget included amounts for 28 of the 30 presidentiallyappointed IGs. It did not include amounts for one IG that was not part of the full budget process, however. requirements did not have a specific budget amount separately disclosed in the President’s budget. Only 7 of the 33 DFE IGs had specific budget amounts for the fiscal year 2011 budget. There were four newly established D FE IGs that were not part of the full fiscal year2011 budget process. The President's budget did not contain specified budgets for the newly established IGs. Only 1 IG commented that the budget would substantially inhibit the IG from performing the duties of the office.. 22 remaining DFE IGs subject to these requirements. We notified the IG Council that most of the D FE IGs and one presidentially appointed IG did not have separate budget amounts included in the President’s budget submission to the Congress. The IG Council has responded that it will review and assess this matter and, if necessary, work with congressional and administration officials to resolve this issue. The IGs’ effectiveness was reflected in a range of reported accomplishments, such as potential dollars to be saved by the government. effectiveness was demonstrated in their efforts to help prevent fraud, waste, and abuse. For example, IGs in agencies receiving Recovery Act funds have reported providing oversight in the areas of establishing and maintaining controls to help ensure the funds are used properly. Also, the IGs’ effectiveness was demonstrated by their reporting on oversight of management challenges identified at their agencies. In their annual report to the President, the IG Act identified billions of dollars in savings and cost recoveries and other accomplishments resulting from their work in fiscal year 2009. fiscal year 2009, these IGs identified $43.3 billion in potential savings from audits and investigations. Over 5,900 criminal actions, 1,100 civil actions, 4,460 suspensions or debarments, and over 6,100 indictments resulted from their work. Based on this information, the potential dollar savings reported by these IGS represent a return on investment of approximately $18 for every IG dollar spent. In addition to measurable accomplishments, IGs also reported actions taken to prevent problems within their agencies. the IGs assisted in the oversight of expenditures authorized by the Recovery Act by reporting on preventive measures taken to help reduce the vulnerability of Recovery Act disbursements to fraud, waste, and abuse. The Recovery Act established the Recovery Board whose members include 12 IGs and an additional IG as the chair, to coordinate and conduct oversight of funds distributed under the act in order to prevent fraud and waste. It requires IG reviews of concerns raised by the public about investments of stimulus funds and provides IGs the authority to examine records. fraud, waste, and abuse. In addition, the board is charged under the act with establishing and maintaining a user friendly website to foster greater accountability and transparency in the use of Recovery Act funds. To help prevent fraud and other potential wrongdoing, the IGs offered training to federal, state, and local employees, as well as contractors, private entities, and award recipients. The IGs’ training was intended to improve awareness of the legal and administrative requirements of the Recovery Act programs. As of June 2011, the Recovery Board received over 7,000 complaints of wrongdoing associated with Recovery. The Recovery Board reported that IGs have provided over 2,000 training sessions to almost 139,000 individuals on the requirements of Recovery Act programs. The identification of management challenges reported annually by federal agencies is key to focusing on effective IG oversight, the Recovery Board said. The report said IGs opened over 1,500 investigations, and completed over 1,.400 reviews of activities intended to improve the use of Recovery. Act funds. In addition, the report said, IGs had provided over 1.5 million training sessions on how to prevent and report fraud. management challenges by the IGs began in 1997. Congressional leaders asked IGs to identify the 10 most serious management problems in their respective agencies. This request began a yearly process that continues as a result of the Reports Consolidation Act of 2000. Not all agencies with IGs have requirements to report management challenges. Fifty-four of the IGS we surveyed reported having certain responsibilities for certain management challenges in their agencies. The report was compiled by the Center for Management and Budget at the University of Maryland. 27 of the IGs appointed by the President and 27 of the DFE IGs reported their agencies’ management challenges. Most of the 203 management challenges they reported for fiscal year 2010 focused on issues specific to their agencies' missions and performance management. For example, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s IG reported that major changes to the direction of the agency were needed to make the agency more efficient, effective and effective. The responses from the IGS appointed by. the President show that most of the203 management challenges that they. reported for Fiscal Year 2010 were related to their missions. Department of Health and Human Services IG cited the management challenges associated with delivery of the nation’s health care. The other management challenges addressed by the IGs relate to information technology, procurement, financial management, and human resources. In addition to providing oversight coverage of management challenges, the presidential IGs issued reports that addressed about 93 percent of themanagement challenges identified. These reports contained recommendations for improving the weaknesses specified by theManagement challenges. For example, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation IG recommended strengthening specific controls over managing the space program. closing process for failed financial institutions which is a key aspect of FDIC’s mission regarding insured depository institutions. Also, the Social Security Administration IG identified transparency and accountability issues as an agency management challenge. The DFE IGs reported 124 management challenges for fiscal year 2010, with a focus on their agencies’ missions, information technology, and performance management. For example, the Farm Credit Administration's IG reported management challenges related to the safety, soundness, and mission accomplishment of the Farm credit System. was often identified as a management challenge. The performance management issues the DFE IGs identified as management challenges included timely implementation of IG recommendations by the Peace Corps. Concerns over internal controls, improper payments, and the security of federal property were also included in the “other’s” category. In addition, the D FE IGs issued reports that addressed almost 90 percent of the management challenges identified and addressed. The report was released on Tuesday. It was compiled by the Federal Maritime Commission, the National Labor Relations Board and the National Archives and Records Administration. contained recommendations for corrective actions. For example, the Farm Credit Administration IG assessed the agency’s readiness to take enforcement actions related to its mission. The 62 federal IGs responding to our survey reported information on their expertise and qualifications. The IGs’ information showed a wide range of backgrounds, skills, and professional certifications relevant to their work consistent with the areas of demonstrated experience specified by the IG Act. The Postal Service IG provided recommendations to improve the efficiency of postal operations related to performance management in sorting the mail. Figure 3 summarizes the background experiences of the 62 IGs who responded to our survey. Most of the IGs reported having degrees in areas that are relevant to performing in an IG position. Additional degrees were reported by both presidential and DFE IGs in areas of criminal justice, investigations, law enforcement; management analysis; and public administration. Other academic degrees reported by presidential and IGs included mathematics, science, sociology, education, psychology, and English. With respect to academic degrees, we also obtained information on the academic degrees obtained by the62 IGs. professional certifications, 6 IGs appointed by the President reported having professional certifications. 28 DFE IGs reported they possessed at least one professional certification related to their IG responsibilities. For the presidential IGs, 2 were certified fraud examiners, 1 reported being a certified internal auditor. 6 reported they are certified public accountants and 6 reported that they were certified internal auditors. Additional certifications reported by the D FE IGs include 6 certified government financial managers, 4 fraud examiner, 3 certified information managers and 2 had certifications in additional separate areas. systems auditors, and 7 with other certifications such as a certified government auditing professional. We received comments from the IG Council (reprinted in app. V), on September 13, 2011. The council commented that the draft provided useful information on the independence, activities, and accomplishments of the federal inspectors general. We also received, and incorporated as appropriate, technical comments from several IG staff members, including a certified information officer and a certified inspector general. (See fig. 5.)

Summary:
As of May 2016, the UN reported that more than 4.8 million Syrians had fled the country and registered as refugees. U.S. funding obligated in support of humanitarian assistance for people affected by the conflict in Syria began in fiscal year 2012 and totaled just over $5 billion, as of February 2016. Food, shelter, nonfood items, health and nutrition, and water, sanitation and hygiene are among the main types of assistance provided inside Syria. The United States provided more than a quarter of the total international funding for the 2015 Syria humanitarian response. operating from Damascus largely remain within Syrian government controlled areas, but may also utilize cross-line deliveries. Financial oversight in humanitarian assistance programs includes managing program funds to ensure they are spent in accordance with funding instruments. Figure 6 shows this complex operating environment. According to USAID, its NGO implementing partners rarely utilizeCross- line deliveries. Figures 6 and 7 are from the U.S. Agency for International Development's (USAID) report on the situation in Syria, released on November 14. Government provides the overall framework for establishing and maintaining internal control. The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission has issued an internal control framework. Internal control generally serves as a first line of defense in safeguarding assets, such as food and nonfood items. In implementing internal control standards, management is responsible for developing the detailed policies, says the Treadsway Commission. The framework is widely used around the world and includes the five components of internal control: control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication. A dangerous operating environment, access issues, and remote management of programs can hinder the delivery of humanitarian assistance. U.S. agency officials must manage programs from outside of Syria, creating challenges for financial oversight, such as increasing the opportunity for fraud and diversion. The increasingly violent and widespread Syrian conflict has hindered effective delivery of aid. Based on our research, we have developed procedures, practices, and practices to fit the entity’s operations and to ensure they are built into and are an integral part of operations. Humanitarian assistance is routinely prevented or delayed from reaching its intended target due to shifting conflict lines, attacks on aid facilities and workers. The years of conflict have led to shifting areas of control as armed groups claim and lose territory. In late May 2015, for example, after ISIS took over the city of Palmyra, it was reported that aid workers had not been able to reach the city. The UN has released a report on the situation inside Syria, as well as interviews with officials providing assistance to Syria. Humanitarian workers inside Syria must work within the insecure operating environment, affecting their ability to carry out their mission and placing their lives at risk. Aid facilities are often indirectly impacted or directly targeted, leading to widespread damage. In one instance, an air strike hit the Syrian Arab Red Crescent offices in Idlib, destroying ambulances and vehicles. The capacity of the Red Crescent to provide first aid services in the city was curtailed. Administrative procedures put in place by the Syrian government have delayed or limited the delivery of humanitarian assistance, according to UNSG reports. As of May 2016, the UN reported that 4.6 million people inside Syria are located in hard-to-reach areas. More than 500,000 of those remain besieged by ISIS, the government of Syria, or non-State armed opposition groups. Parties to the conflict heavily restrict or deny humanitarian access to besieged areas, and people risk infectious disease, malnutrition, poor sanitation, and lack of medical care. The UN estimated that the lives of roughly 42,000 people remained besieged by government forces in the towns of Madaya and Buqayn. The UN reported that in 2015, only 10 percent of all requests for UN inter-agency convoys to hard-to-reach and besieged areas were approved and delivered. Even when these convoys were approved, the officials participating in delivering the assistance were sometimes subjected to hours-long delays, stretching into the middle of the night. State's and USAID’s implementing partners also told us that they rarely operate inside ISIS controlled areas because they cannot ensure that they will be able to operate. within the humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality, and operational independence. The UN reports contain multiple instances of ISIS blocking humanitarian and commercial access into and through areas under its control. For example, in November 2015, the UN reported that ISIS controlled and blocked humanitarian access to a stretch of highway leading to the western parts of Aleppo city. As a result, theUN was unable to deliver assistance to over 220,000 people. Due to restrictions, USAID and State staff manage the delivery of humanitarian assistance in Syria remotely from neighboring countries. in 2012 due to security conditions and the safety of personnel, among other factors. According to State and USAID officials, the inability to access Syria limits the visibility that staff have over the provision of humanitarian assistance. USAID also acknowledged several gaps in their monitoring system due to remote management, such as verifying progress, obtaining comprehensive information. The U.S. State Department says it is working with the Syrian government to improve the security situation in the country and provide more access to humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people. monitoring data on individual activities, and assessing the quality of monitoring data reported to USAID. In the absence of direct program monitoring, USAID and State officials noted that they utilize information provided by implementing partners to help ensure effective delivery of assistance and to help their financial oversight. USAID officials in the region explained to us that while partners provide data and information, their inability to consistently access project sites limited the extent to which partners could obtain and use the data. The report was based on interviews with officials from USAID, the State Department, and the United Nations. verify progress. Staff from several USAID-funded implementing partners told us they were unable to access project sites in southern Syria. Past audit work has shown challenges to such an approach, including cases of partners not fully implementing monitoring practices, resulting in limited project accountability. USAID Office of Inspector General (OIG) has reported that assistance projects implemented in developing countries are at significant risk of fraud, waste, and abuse, and further noted that those risks are multiplied when projects unfold in Syria. USAID OIG has noted that aid organizations providing life-saving assistance in Syria and the surrounding region face an extremely high-risk environment. The absence of adequate internal controls, among other challenges, can jeopardize the integrity of these relief efforts and deny critical aid to those in need. State and USAID do not require implementing partners to conduct comprehensive risk assessments for humanitarian assistance delivered to people inside Syria. While most partners assessed safety and security risks associated with such programs, most did not assess financial risks, such as the risk of financial losses.  USAID drafts memoranda highlighting potential risks for material support to terrorist groups. State asks its implementing partners to have internal control policies in place and report information on certain risks. Without such formal assessments, implementing partners may not have all information needed to design appropriate controls to mitigate such risks. U.S. agency officials charged with overseeing these programs might not have visibility into areas of risk, such as fraud and loss due to theft and diversion. Of fraud, USAID requires implementing partners operating humanitarian assistance to people inside Syria to conduct risk assessments. USAID’s Office of Food for Peace (FFP) and Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) require some implementing partners to create a Safety and Security Plan. USAID noted that it works closely with partners to ensure accountability and to ensure that assistance is reaching beneficiaries. While there is not a requirement, according to State, it has established framework agreements with its implementing partners emphasizing the commitment of the partner to internal controls, including risk management. However, the voluntary contribution agreements between State and these implementing partners do not reference the framework agreements or require comprehensive risk assessments. USAID OIG has four ongoing investigations of allegations of fraud and mismanagement related to programs for delivering humanitarian assistance to people inside Syria. Two of the investigations involve allegations of procurement fraud, bribery, and product substitution. Four of the nine partners in our sample conducted cross-border delivery operations from neighboring countries such as Turkey or Jordan and, therefore, procured goods in the host country or the region and warehoused them prior to transport into Syria. The inability of some partners to consistently access areas in Syria and directly monitor programs has created challenges for oversight.

Summary:
Preventive health care can extend lives and promote well-being among our nation’s seniors. Medicare now covers a number of preventive services, including immunizations, such as hepatitis B and influenza. Not all beneficiaries, however, avail themselves of covered preventive services. Some beneficiaries may simply choose not to use these services, but others may be unaware that the services are available or covered by Medicare.. For some beneficiaries, certain services may not be warranted or may be of limited value. Appropriate preventive care depends on an individual's age and particular health risks. A proposed CMS demonstration, currently in design, will explore another preventive care delivery option and examine the value of linking beneficiaries to needed follow-up services. Primary care physicians typically cannot provide services such as mammography screenings for breast cancer or colonoscopies for colon cancer. It is uncertain whether a one-time or periodic examination would be an effective way to improve beneficiaries’ health, the authors say. The design phase had not been finalized as of last week and required approval from HHS and the Office of Management and Budget.

Summary:
In November 2011, President Obama and leaders of the European Union (EU) named a High Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth to recommend steps to broaden transatlantic economic ties. In its final report, issued in February 2013, the working group called for a new bilateral agreement to govern transatlantic trade and investment. Such an agreement, the group urged, should provide for "the promotion of more compatible approaches to current and future regulation and standard-setting" One month later, Obama notified Congress that the United States would enter into negotiations. The negotiations would seek greater compatibility of U.S. and EU regulations and related standards development processes. The formal TTIP negotiations began in July 2013. Motor vehicle safety and emissions standards are areas where the United States and the EU are at odds. The TTIP would seek to reduce costs associated with unnecessary regulatory differences and facilitate trade, inter alia by promoting transparency in the development and implementation of regulations and good regulatory practices, and pursuing regulatory cooperation initiatives where appropriate. The negotiations are called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) Trade in vehicles and parts between the United States and the EU reached $57 billion in 2012. The major U.S. and European motor vehicle manufacturer associations have called for TTIP to provide for mutual recognition of existing technical standards. Such steps, an industry alliance has contended, would "increase trade, lower costs, create jobs and improve the international competitiveness of the industry" in both North America and Europe. The alliance estimates that TTIP could be completed by the end of the year. Current non-tariff barriers on vehicles are equivalent to a 26% tariff on vehicle imports. U.S. vehicle and parts exports to the EU could raise by over 200% and EU by 71%. Safety, fuel efficiency, and emissions standards differ between the two regions due to historical differences in producer and consumer preferences as well as the role of government in industry practices. The United States and the EU have different standards even for an item as large as a car. It projects that elimination of tariffs and just 10% of non-Tariff barriers could raise U.K. vehicle exports by over 50%. Past auto agreements have been effective in leading to a more globalized auto industry. The 1965 motor vehicle agreement between the United States and Canada and the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) removed barriers to trade and cross-border trade in autos. Some of these differences may reflect past efforts to protect domestic vehicle industries against foreign competition. Others may result from different legal traditions or divergent views as to the best way to achieve goals such as cleaner air and reduced oil consumption.simple as a seat belt. The EU and the United States are the second- and third-largest vehicle producers in the world. Together, they account for nearly one-third of global auto production. TTIP represents another effort to extend these regional templates to encompass a greater share of trade and investment. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, a separate negotiation involving the U.S. and 11 other Pacific Rim countries, could have a similar effect. The EU 27 produced more than the United states in 2012, compared to 10.3 million vehicles. same in 2012: 14.8 million vehicles sold in the United States and 14.3 million in the EU. Seventeen of the EU member states manufacture vehicles. Germany is by far the largest auto producer within the EU (see Figure 2 ). The five top countries—Germany, Spain, France, United Kingdom and Czech Republic—manufacture more than 76% of all vehicles produced in the European Union. In the U.S., vehicles are manufactured in 15 states. Unlike some consumer goods, such as computers and apparel, most vehicles are sold in. region where they are produced because of local consumer preferences and vehicle standards. In 2012, imports constituted about 20% of U.S. sales, and about 17% of sales in the EU. In some cases, a vehicle that is entirely legal in one country may not be sold in another due to differing fuel efficiency, safety, and emissions standards. For example, Ford Motor Company's ECOnetic high-efficiency diesel engine, made in Great Britain, gets up to 71 miles per gallon (mpg) of fuel. This engine is not sold. in North America because it does not comply with U.S. and Canadian emissions standards. Ford has determined that expanding its Mexican engine plant to make a redesigned version of the ECOnetic for North America would cost $350 million. Increasingly, auto manufacturers and their parts suppliers have sought to organize their production on a global basis. The German automaker BMW, as an example, produces sport utility vehicles for markets worldwide from a plant in South Carolina. Greater commonality in regulation would make it easier for automakers and parts makers to organize production. coordinate production across major markets. Automakers are developing global vehicle platforms that will reduce the number of models sold around the world. For example, the new Jeep Cherokee and Dodge Dart are based on Fiat's Compact Wide platform. The Ford Focus was developed in Europe but is built with similar components in the United States, China, Germany, Russia, and Thailand and sold in 130 countries. Joining forces to meet tightening world emission standards is one of the key ways to reduce carbon emissions in the future. standards. Many countries, including the United States, have adopted new standards that will be costly for manufacturers to meet. Automakers have responded by creating partnerships to develop more powerful batteries, multispeed transmissions, techniques to improve engine efficiency. Along these lines, BMW and Toyota have agreed to jointly develop fuel cell technology. About half of all the passenger cars sold in Europe have diesel engines, which are more efficient than gasoline engines and emit a lower level of some greenhouse gases. Many automakers believe that offering diesels (as well as higher-performing higher-performance vehicles) is a good idea. gasoline, electric, and hybrid vehicles) will be necessary to meet higher U.S. fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions standards. Having similar standards for diesel engines in the two regions could reduce design and manufacturing costs. In the United States, private standards and state regulation prevailed until the 1960s and 1970s, when federal legislation was passed. Since then, Congress has delegated vehicle regulation to federal agencies, occasionally providing specific direction through legislation. The processes by which the US and EU establish vehicle safety, fuel efficiency, and emission standards have evolved in different ways. In Europe, a system of governmental control over autos was more prevalent, first in each country and later through the EU. EU directives passed by the European Parliament have the force of regulations. In the early decades of the automobile, U.S. vehicles were lightly regulated by a combination of state and private sector standards. While one industry magazine called for national motor vehicle standards as early as 1902, it did so mainly to reassure would-be buyers of the vehicle. The European Parliament has a more direct role in the regulatory process than is the case in the United States. integrity these new, little-understood machines. Regulating either driver conduct or vehicle design at the national level did not conform to existing political ideas about the appropriate federal division of responsibilities. The only useful and politically acceptable action Congress might take was to help the states and localities construct more and better roads. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), a professional association founded in 1905, became the primary source of vehicle safety and emission rules for many decades. It is no longer in existence. State governments often used SAE recommendations to enact requirements for vehicle equipment, such as dual brakes, headlamps, and windshield wipers. Other SAE standards were adopted directly by manufacturers. The first step toward a nationwide system of vehicle regulation came in 1926, when a voluntary Uniform Vehicle Code was drafted to replace the many different state rules. By 1946, 30 of the then 48 states (plus the District of Columbia) had adopted the Uniform Vehicle code. The code specified the types of lighting, reflectors, brakes, mirrors, and tires that cars should have. Vehicle Code; 13 had implemented portions and only six had taken no action. With the start of the Interstate Highway system in the 1950s, greater automobile travel, and rising highway deaths, the interest in vehicle safety grew. Between 1962 and 1964, Congress passed three safety bills into law, including a seat belt regulation. These laws set the stage for more ambitious legislation a few years later. For example, the legislation establishing safety requirements for federal fleet vehicles led to the promulgation of 17 standards by 1966. Most significant change in U.S. vehicle safety regulation came with the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966. Senator Abraham Ribicoff, one of the advocates of the new legislation, said "this problem is so vast that the Federal Government must have a role" As passed unanimously by both houses of Congress and signed by President Johnson, the legislation was a major impetus. Curtailing auto-related highway deaths was a other major impetus for the legislation. The legislation was signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson in 1966. The Highway Safety Act of 1966 mandated that each state put in place a highway safety program in accordance with federal standards. The National Traffic Safety Agency was established to carry out the provisions. In 1967, the agency was renamed the National Highway Traffic Safety Safety Agency. The agency was later changed to the Secretary of Transportation when that agency was established in 1967. The act was signed into law on January 1, 1967. It was one of the first federal highway safety laws in the history of the U.S. Senator Warren Magnuson, chairman of the Commerce Committee, argued that Congress was implementing a limited type of regulation. The committee also recognizes that the broad powers conferred upon the Secretary, while essential to achieve improved traffic safety, could be abused in such a manner as to have serious adverse effects on the automotive manufacturing industry. The Committee expects that the Secretary will act responsibly and inSuch a way as to achieve a better traffic safety. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) was established in 1970. substantial improvement in the safety characteristics of vehicles. Since it was established, NHTSA has issued dozens of safety standards, and it maintains an extensive database on vehicle crashes. The law puts the onus for enforcement of federal standards on automakers themselves. It provides that "a manufacturer or distributor of a motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment shall certify to the distributor or dealer at delivery that the vehicle or equipment complies with applicable motor vehicle safety standards prescribed" The agency neither approves motor vehicles or parts as complying with its standards nor collects information from manufacturers. NHTSA buys vehicles from dealers and tests them at its own facilities. If NHTSA determines there is noncompliance, it can encourage the manufacturer to recall the model to correct the problem or can order a recall. The law also makes manufacturers responsible for testing of vehicles and liable for recalls and penalties if they are later found not to meet NHTsa's standards.under this chapter.... Certification of a vehicle must be shown by a label or tag permanently fixed to the vehicle. in this chapter. In Until the 1950s, European vehicle safety regulations developed separately in each country. Interest in harmonizing vehicle regulation emerged as part of the process of European economic integration. The European vehicle regulatory regime now includes both EU directives, which must be implemented by all member states, and standards promulgated through a United Nations organization. In 1952, the United Nations (U.N.) established the Working Party on the Construction (WPC), which is still in existence today. The WPC is responsible for the development of European vehicle standards. WP.29 is a subsidiary body of the Inland Transport Committee of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) WP.29 administers a 1958 agreement on vehicle construction and two related agreements which were adopted by some European countries to promote EU-wide integration of vehicle design, construction and safety. UNECE standards deal with vehicle safety, environmental protection, fuel efficiency, and anti-theft performance. Signatories to the 1958 U.N. agreement commit to mutual recognition of each other. UNECE regulations do not cover the whole vehicle, only its parts. WP.29's voting members are limited to government representatives, but automakers, trade associations, and other nongovernmental organizations also participate in its meetings. The United States did not sign the 1958 UNECE agreement because it would require mutual recognition of standards generated outside the United States. After U.S. self-certification began in 1967, the UNecE approach was seen as incompatible with the U.s. process. The U.S. signed a 1998 UNECE agreement which establishes global technical regulations (GTRs) GTRs are issued in a UN Global Registry and contracting parties use their own regulatory process to implement them. Unlike the 1958 agreement, there is no requirement for type approval and mutual recognition of approvals. The World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations promulgates regulations affecting vehicle safety, environmental protection, energy efficiency, and anti-theft performance. It is a U.N. body with a global approach. UNECE and its successor, the EU, have sought to promote a single European market in motor vehicles. Tariffs on cars traded between member states were eliminated in 1968. In 1970, the European Community enacted a framework that laid the basis for vehicle approval harmonization across all member states. Initially, European working groups on vehicle safety issues based their work on U.S. standards and practice because the United States had established a federal safety program earlier. It has been suggested that one reason for the slow development of European standards is the lack of a national safety program. Some European automakers "preferred to limit the extension of standards to those that would create obstacles to the invasion of foreign vehicles into their national markets" Over time, the balance shifted to favor more similarity between U.S. and EU standards. Since 1970, the EU has used the Whole Vehicle Type Approval system, under which production samples of new model cars must be approved by national government authorities. An automaker must submit the "type" of vehicle it intends to manufacture and sell to the EU. All EU member states enforce the EU standards. Unlike the UNECE standards, the EU system applies to a complete vehicle. Nearly every EU country has either a government agency or designated privately-owned test houses that conduct testing to ensure new models will meet all standards. Once formal approval is obtained, the automaker then issues a "certificate of conformity" to the vehicle. The EU system often takes into account the UNecE standards promulgated for specific auto parts, as well as other auto parts. Once an EU member state approves a new vehicle, it can be marketed throughout the EU. The EU agreed in 2007 that the UNECE regulations would be incorporated into the EU type-approval procedure. Legislative work at the EU level is led by European Commission's Directorate of Enterprise and Industry. Vehicle safety promotion is also pursued by the European Commission through initiatives such as DG Transport's EU road safety action program and DG Information and Society's E-safety and Intelligent Car initiatives. programs to address air pollution in the United States. Ground-level ozone production, commonly referred to as "smog," is a critical aspect of the air quality problem in urban areas. Independent analysis in the mid-1950s identified the automobile as a key source of ground- level ozone. Research has since demonstrated that cars and other mobile sources are responsible for a variety of other air pollutants, including carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NO x ), particulate matter (PM), air toxics, and greenhouse gases (GHG) vehicles are responsible for contributing to the formation of ground-level ozone. motor vehicles represent the largest domestic source of air toxics, or pollutants known or suspected to cause cancer or other serious health or environmental effects. vehicles have been determined to contribute approximately one quarter of domestic GHG emissions, which trap heat in the earth's atmosphere, contributing to global climate change. The federal government first addressed air pollution in 1955 in the Federal Air Pollution Control Act, which provided funding to state and local governments. In 1959, California became the first state to address pollution from cars. In 1960, Congress directed the Surgeon General to study the "various substances discharged from the exhausts of motor vehicles" This regulatory pattern continued throughout the 1960s, as California authorities established control requirements and the U.S. government followed suit. For example, California required the control of crankcase emissions in 1961and set the first HC and CO emissions in 1964. In 1965, California set a limit on the amount of CO emissions a car can emit. The federal Motor Vehicle Air Pollution Control Act of 1965 adopted both the California crankcase and tailpipe emissions standards for 1968 model-year vehicles. Congress's provision for national emissions standards was based primarily on testimonies by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and the automotive industry. Congress strengthened federal authority in 1967 by explicitly preempting states from adopting or enforcing new motor vehicle emission standards. The act engaged the federal government for the first time in the actual regulation of vehicle emissions. It was passed in 1964. At present, the federal government manages vehicle emissions controls. California remains a major force in shaping national legislation and regulations. Emission standards for engines and vehicles, including emission standards for greenhouse gases, are currently established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. EPA authority to regulate vehicle emissions—and air quality in general—is based on the Clean Air Act. As with safety regulations, the development of vehicle emission standards is overseen by the EPA, not the California Department of Public Health and Social Services. standards by EPA is in accordance with the federal rulemaking process. New regulations are first published as proposed rules, and following a period of public discussion may be withdrawn, approved, or amended before entering into force. Current EPA emissions standards for vehicles (referred to as "Tier 2" requirements) regulate CO, NO x , PM, and HC emissions. Under the Tier 2 regulation, the same emission standards apply to all vehicle weight categories, (i.e., cars, minivans, light-duty trucks, and SUVs have the same emissions limit) California is the only state vested by the CAA with the authority to develop its own emission regulations if EPA grants the state a waiver. California emission standards are administered by the California Air Resources Board, a regulatory body within the California Environmental Protection Agency. The CAA allows other states a choice between implementing federal emission standards or adopting the California requirements. The evolution of U.S. emission standards for light-duty, gasoline-fueled vehicles is traced to the 1970s and '80s. "Tier 2" standards have been in place since 2004. Anyone wishing to sell an engine or vehicle within the U.S. must demonstrate compliance with the CAA and all applicable EPA regulations. This approval process differs from the self-certification used by NHTSA and is closer to the EU type approval system for safety and emissions regulations. Once EPA sets emission standards for a particular engine and/or vehicle category, it can be applied to that engine and vehicle category. In addition to exhaust emission standards, U.N. regulations address many other emission-related issues. Vehicle exhaust emissions were regulated in Europe beginning in 1970. In June 1991, the Council of Ministers of the European Council adopted the Consolidated Emissions Directive (commonly referred to as "Euro 1") The evolution of EU exhaust emission standards for light-duty, gasoline- and diesel-fueled vehicles is traced in Table A-2 of the Appendix. The EU uses the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC) and the United States uses the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) raised the fuel economy standards of passenger vehicles, light trucks, and sport utility vehicles to a combined average of at least 35 mpg by 2020. In 2009, the Obama Administration, some state regulators, and the auto industry crafted a federal program to implement new light duty vehicle fuel efficiency standards linked to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards. The combined standards call for fleet-average passenger car and light truck GHG emissions of no more than 163 grams per mile by 2025. This translates to average fuel economy of 54.5 mpg. EU GHG standards return a greater sales-based and fleet-wide emission reduction than those in the United States. Figure 4 represents an estimate of historical and projected fuel economy targets, adjusted for the factors outlined above. In the U.S. and the EU, NGOs play a role in the setting of vehicle standards, including these entities: Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE ) remains involved in developing recommended standards for industry and has issued or updated about 2,000 motor vehicle standards in the past five years. About 10% of NHTSA and EPA standards are based on work SAE has already done. ISO has developed nearly 20,000 standards across a range of industries. For example, a 2010 ISO standard addressed automotive crankshaft bearings. International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is a private organization founded in 1906 that develops and implements standards.or emissions. Standards are typically developed through negotiation in technical committees comprising representatives of many countries. The International Organization for Standardization ( ISO) was founded in 1947 and develops voluntary international standards. IEC standards related to motor vehicles concern charging system architecture, lithium batteries, and other aspects of electric vehicles. Various other private-sector advocacy groups are engaged in identifying and publicizing new vehicle standards. In the United States, these include the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, American National Standards Institute (ANSI), National Safety Council, the Center for Auto Safety, and Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety. in the EU, nonprofit groups such as the European Transport Safety are involved in the development of new standards. European, U.S. and Japanese auto industry groups sought common regulatory ground in 1996. They proposed to harmonize regulation of five vehicle components, including windshield wipers, defoggers, and seat belt assemblies. The regulatory bodies did not agree to any changes, however, because the data-driven review process made it difficult to prove functional equivalency of even a standard component such as a seat belt. This experience suggested that the EU standard-setting process should be changed to make it more transparent. obtaining functional equivalency determinations from regulatory agencies might be difficult. An alternative approach was developed in the 1998 UN agreement on global technical regulations, which created a global registry of processes and common technical standards. This initiative, resulting in the creation of the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations, has resulted in agreement on only 13 technical regulations to date. Simultaneously, there has been a transatlantic dialogue on autos since the mid-1990s through the U.S.-EU High-Level Regulatory Cooperation Forum. The 1996 TransAtlantic Automotive Industry Conference on International Regulatory Harmonization produced a report on the auto sector. NHTSA sent a report to Congress in April 1997 discussing potential harmonization of U.S. and European side impact standards. A similar bilateral regulatory initiative has been under way since 2011 with Canada. An EU initiative, the Competitive Automotive Regulatory System for the 21s Century, or CARS 21, has also explored harmonization issues. A 2012 CARs 21 report recommended exploration of ways to bring about "stronger internationalisation of standards" In 2006, CARS 21 called for gradually replacing some EU laws with UN regulations. More than 40 EU directives have been replaced with corresponding UN regulations since that time. Harmonization need not mean having identical rules in both regions. From the viewpoint of auto manufacturers, it means minimizing unnecessary differences in regulations so that a "single vehicle standard" can be built to satisfy all. The U.S. and the EU could address convergence of automotive regulations under TTIP. These include the following: H armonization of rules. requirements." C omprehensive mutual recognition . This approach would permit automakers to sell vehicles in either market if they meet either a U.S. standard or a standard accepted in the EU. This approach is how the EU certification process works. S elective mutual recognition. This would identify certain major standards for which TTIP could provide mutual recognition, rather than providing mutual recognition of all standards. A car certified as compliant with US safety, emission, and fuel efficiency standards would be accepted as compliant in EU, and vice versa. side impact protection, child restraint systems, and some emissions standards as priorities for selective mutual recognition. A fourth option would be to forge an agreement on emerging regulations, such as those dealing with electric and fuel cell vehicles, rather than focusing on existing regulations. Under this approach, the United States and the EU would commit to jointly develop standards covering new issues or technologies. The pending free trade agreement between the EU and Canada may influence the direction of TTIP. The full text of the agreement has not been released, but according to an EU statement, Canada will recognise a list of EU car standards and will examine the recognition of further standards. This will make it much easier to export cars to Canada. The agreement is also said to allow Canadian vehicles to be certified in Canada for the EU market. Convergence of vehicle standards has potential drawbacks. One aspect pertains to the lack of speed with which governmental agencies can address new technologies and vehicle innovations. The rule-making process is already lengthy, and the need for international coordination could make it even longer. that could reduce accidents may be delayed in reaching the market. The EU acknowledges that if vehicle standards become international, there could be less room for legislative scrutiny. U.S. consumer advocacy groups have raised similar concerns about TTIP. The United States and the EU must not limit the United States or the EU from adopting and enforcing standards that provide higher levels of consumer, worker, and environmental protection, the groups say in a July 2013 letter to the leaders of the U.K. and U. S. Congress. could play an important role if a TTIP agreement contains significant provisions related to auto safety, emissions, and fuel economy regulations. Congress established the U.S. government agencies whose regulations are the focus of the negotiations on automobile standards. If the TTIP effort to obtain mutual recognition or harmonization affects agencies' authority or changes the ways in which automotive regulations are developed and implemented, Congress may well be asked to modify the underlying statutes that govern motor vehicle safety, emission, and Fuel Economy regulations. The Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990 ( P.L. 101-549 ) established standards to limit tailpipe emissions from new motor vehicles. These Tier 1 standards applied to all new light-duty vehicles. Separate sets of standards were defined for each vehicle category, with more relaxed limits for heavier vehicles. The CAAA also required EPA to study the need for new tailpipe standards for heavy vehicles, such as SUVs, minivans, and pick-up trucks. EPA promulgated "Tier 2" standards on February 10, 2000. The Tier 2 regulations introduced more stringent numerical emission limits and a number of additional changes that tightened the standards for larger vehicles. Since light-duty emission standards are expressed in grams of pollutants per mile, vehicles with large engines (such light trucks or SUVs) were required to use more advanced emission control technologies. The same emission standards apply to all vehicle weight categories. Further, the same emission limits apply toAll vehicles regardless of the fuel they use. than vehicles with smaller engines. Tier 2 emission standards were structured into eight permanent and three temporary certification levels of different stringency. Manufacturers had a choice to certify particular vehicles to any of the available bins, but were required to meet a fleet-average requirement for NO x emissions in any given model year. U.S. emissions standards are shown in Table A-1 . EU standards are based on grams per kilometer. The standards are not strictly comparable because U.N. standards arebased on gram per mile. EU Vehicle Emission Standards and Implementation In June 1991, the Council of Ministers of the European Council adopted the Consolidated Emissions Directive (commonly referred to as "Euro 1") Under Euro 1, exhaust emission standards for all passenger cars, including diesels, were certified. In September of 2014, Euro 6 standards will be introduced. EU emission limits for each "Euro" stage are summarized in Table A-2 . Fuel Economy and Greenhouse Gas Standards U.S. Fuel economy and GHG standards and Implementation standards call for combined passenger car and light truck greenhouse gas emissions of no more than 163 grams per mile by 2025. This translates into a 54.5 mile-per-gallon equivalent. The GHG standards are based on CO 2 emissions-footprint curves, where each vehicle has a different emissions compliance target depending on its "footprint" value. Table A-3 shows the projected fleet-wide CO 2 emission and fuel economy requirements. The EPA CO 2 -equivalent fuel economy figures are different from the CAFE standards for light trucks. Figures because the EPA allows additional CO 2 credits for air conditioning improvements and other flexibilities. In addition to the fleet-average CO 2 emission targets, the rule also includes emission caps for tailpipe nitrous oxide and methane emissions. The regulation also includes a system of averaging, banking, and trading (ABT) of credits, based on a manufacturer's fleet average CO 2 performance. Credit trading is allowed among all vehicles a manufacturer produces, both cars and light trucks, as well as between companies. not issue fuel economy standards similar to the U.S. CAFE standards. As shown in Table A-4 , EU fleet-average CO 2 emission targets as required by EU Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 are 130 g/km to be reached by 2015. A long-term target of 95 g/ km to be reach by 2020 is also required by the EU. For more information on the EU's CO 2 emissions targets, visit the European Commission's website. for more information about the EU CO2 emissions targets.

Summary:
The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) was created to address some of the perceived regulatory weaknesses that may have contributed to the magnitude of the financial crisis of 2008. The council has six basic policy tools with which to pursue its mission. The distinction between depository banks and non-bank financial firms is important to understanding the FSOC because many of the new powers attempt to create a regulatory and resolution regime for non-banks that is similar to the way Depository banks are handled. The FSOC may set aside some financial regulations for consumers if the rules might cause systemic risk, under certain circumstances. The 2013 annual report says that there has been significant improvement in mortgage markets, but additional progress is needed. There may be regulatory uncertainty as federal agencies implement changes to regulations related to the mortgage market. The conservatorship agreements (Treasury Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements, PSPAs) have been modified to expedite the wind-down of the retained portfolios of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Regulatory uncertainty in mortgage Markets may be reduced by the publication of final rules for the Real Estate Settlement Procedures. Act (RESPA), the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), and the Dodd-Frank Act's ability-to-pay standard. Additional work may need to be done to raise GSE guarantee fees to make room for private competitors to the GSEs. The financial infrastructure can also be a source of systemic risk. This is essentially the "plumbing" of the financial system. It includes the environment in which financial trading occurs, communications of the interbank payment system, clearing and settlement of retail payments. The financial infrastructure is vulnerable to natural disasters and human activity. Hurricane Sandy temporarily halted trading on the New York Stock Exchange in October 2012. Malfunctions have disrupted the issuance of securities (such as the initial public offering of Facebook). Reportedly, major financial institutions have been subjected to attempts to access the system. The stability of such systems can be threatened by the potential disruptions to the operational network. It can be difficult to predict the impact of a cyber-attack on the financial system. It is possible that a cyber attack could have a significant impact on financial markets. confidential information or disrupt their telecommunications (cyberattacks). The 2013 annual report noted several initiatives to address operational issues. The SEC recently proposed Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity (Regulation SCI) to try to address malfunctions in capital markets. Future interest rate changes may be a factor in the future of the capital markets, according to the FSOC's 2013 annual Report. The 2013 report was released on Thursday, November 14. It is available online at: http://www.fsoc.org/. A combination of a global savings glut, deficient aggregate demand, and central bank interest-rate policies have contributed to an extended period of low interest rates. At some point, interest rates are likely to rise, either because the demand for loanable funds rises as the economy improves driving up the rates or because a negative shock causes a spike. Financial intermediaries, including but not limited to banks, can be damaged by rising interest rates if they have not adequately addressed the mismatch between the interest rates on their cost of funds. There are several examples of rising interest rates contributing to stress in the financial system. Rising rates in the 1970s and 1980s created a great deal of stress for banks that had funded long-term mortgages with short-term deposits. In 1994, rising rates in 1994 caused a significant sell-off in the bond market. Rising Rates during 2004-2006 contributed to the financial crisis of 2004-06. In 2008, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.25 per cent. to the end of the housing bubble (which would have ended eventually, but perhaps not at that time) Under-reporting of LIBOR rates in 2008 may have given financial regulators an overoptimistic view of the lending ability of major financial institutions during the liquidity crunch. Low interest rates make it difficult for savers to earn significant returns with relative safety. Money market mutual funds are at greater risk because their income stream (from relatively safe bonds) is close to zero, according to the IMF. Pension systems may find it difficult to earn adequate returns safely, especially if they have committed to defined benefits (a preset fixed payment) Other investors may have a greater temptation to "reach for yield" by investing in more risky categories of investments, increasing the likelihood of asset bubbles in other markets. In its 2013 report, the FSOC attributes current interest rates (low yields) to three factors: low yields, low inflation, and low interest rates on long-term Treasury bonds and short-term interest rates. factors. Capital market participants forecast continued low interest rate policies by major central banks globally. The second is the pricing of short-term risk, which is partially caused by the increase in Treasury market purchases by institutions with low-risk sensitivity. The third factor cited by the FSOC is the willingness of bond market buyers to accept credit risk (i.e., the risk that borrowers will not pay back fully and on time) Provisions for credit losses and loan losses have declined recently. The FSOC notes a number of initiatives to mitigate the risks when Investigation and prosecutions related to LIBOR (and similar reference rates) may reduce the incentive to misreport. The FSOC did express concern at potential reaches for yield, noting that the issuance of high yield bonds (riskier classes of bonds) had increased markedly. Underwriting standards for collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) had reportedly loosened. Furthermore, threats to financial stability posed by rising rates are mitigated in part by one of the potential causes of rising rates—improved financial conditions. rates rise for the "wrong" reason, a second credit crunch. The FSOC notes that the measurable financial resilience of major banks (such as capital levels and measures of liquidity) have improved. Typically, recessions cause government revenues to decline and government spending to rise (fiscal policy expands) Economic booms can cause fiscal policy to contract if government revenues expand faster than government spending. Long-term fiscal policy refers to the balance between expected government spending and revenues over an extended period of time. extended time horizon. CBO and other projections of long-term fiscal policy project an imbalance between expected federal revenues and expected federal spending for an extended period of time. Thus far, the United States has not experienced any backlash in bond markets for running extended fiscal deficits. Not only has the yield on U.S. Treasury bonds remained low, but obligations of the United states have been viewed as a safe haven for some foreign investors and central banks. How it Might Go Wrong Fiscal imbalances can cause short-term problems and long- term problems. Unlike Cyprus or Greece, short-term fiscal problems of the U.S. could be cushioned by purchases of Treasury securities by the Fed. A short-run fiscal crisis is often accompanied by the same kinds of poor economic conditions that cause the Fed to expand its monetary policies. In the longer term, the combination of higher interest rates and higher outstanding debt can cause interest payments to crowd out the Fed's purchases of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities. The Fed has been buying Treasury securities since the 1980s. Financial instability overseas can threaten financial stability in the U.S. There are many channels through which financial instability can cross borders. Changes in the perceived risk of the debt of sovereigns are potential threats to financial stability. No formal way to address a sovereign default (no international bankruptcy law applies to sovereigns) expansionary monetary policies run the risk of competitive devaluation if policymakers fail to coordinate across countries. The 2013 FSOC report addressed several issues related to global financial stability, including the potential for the European Central Bank to purchase sovereign debt. Two companies are affiliated when one owns all or a large part of another. All subsidiaries are affiliates, but affiliates that are less than 50% controlled are usually not treated as subsidiaries. Asset-backed security is a bond that represents a share in a pool of debt obligations or other assets. The holder is entitled to some part of the repayment flows from the underlying debt. (See "Securitization.") Bank holding company is a company controlled by a third company (see "Subsidiary"). The Bank Holding Company Act is the federal statute under which the Fed regulates bank holding companies. Besides the permissible financial activities enumerated in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( P.L. 106-102 ), the law provides a mechanism between the Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury to decide what is an appropriate new financial activity for a bank holding company. The law also provides a way for the Fed and Treasury to determine what is appropriate for a financial holding company to do in the future. financial activity for FHCs. Blue sky laws —State statutes that govern the offering and selling of securities. Broker/dealer —An individual or firm that buys and sells securities for itself as well as for customers. Bubble —Self-reinforcing process in which the price of an asset exceeds its fundamental value for a sustained period, often followed by a rapid price decline. Speculative bubbles are usually associated with a "bandwagon" effect in which speculators rush to buy the commodity (in the case of futures, "to take positions") even greater rush to sell the commodity (unwind positions) when prices reverse. Capital requirements help assure that losses that might occur will accrue to the institution incurring them. In the case of banking institutions experiencing problems, capital also serves as a buffer against losses to the federal deposit insurance funds. Capital is the owners' stake in an enterprise. It is a critical line of defense when losses occur, both in banking and nonbanking enterprises. Capital —Assets minus liabilities; what a firm owns minus what it owes. Troubled Asset Relief Program provides financial assistance to U.S. financial institutions through the purchase of senior preferred shares in the corporations. Charter conversion —Banking institutions may, with the approval of their regulators, switch their corporate form between: commercial bank or savings institution, National or State charter. Clearing Organization —An entity through which futures and other derivative transactions are cleared and settled. Also known as a clearing organization may be a division or affiliate of a particular exchange, or a freestanding entity. called a clearing house, multilateral clearing organization, or clearing association. Collateralized debt obligation (CDO)—A bond created by the securitization of a pool of asset backed securities. Commercial bank —A deposit-taking institution that can make commercial loans, accept checking accounts, and whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. National banks are chartered by the National Bank of Canada. (See CDO and CMO.) Collateralize mortgage obligation (CMO)—A multiclass bond backed by a pool. of mortgage pass-through securities or mortgage loans. Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (CFMA, P.L. 106-554, 114 Stat. 2763)—Overhauled the Commodity Exchange Act to create a flexible structure for the regulation of futures and options trading. Commercial Paper Funding Facility Emergency Program —Created by the Fed in 2008, this program purchased three-month unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper from eligible companies. Community Reinvestment Act 1977 — A federal law which encouraged depository institutions to make loans and provide services. Consolidated Supervised Entities program — Securities and Exchange Commission program that provided voluntary supervision for the five largest investment bank conglomerates. Conservatorship —When an insolvent financial institution is reorganized by a regulator with the intent to restoring it to an ongoing business. Counterparty —The opposite party in a bilateral agreement, contract, or transaction, such as a swap. Credit Default Swap (CDS)—A tradeable contract in which one party agrees to pay another if a third party experiences a credit event. Debt obligation, bankruptcy, or credit rating downgrade. Credit Risk — The risk that a borrower will fail to repay a loan in full. Credit Rating Agency — Private company that evaluates the credit quality of securities and provides ratings on those securities. Credit Union — A nonprofit financial cooperative of individuals with one or more common bonds (such as employment, labor union membership, or residence in the same neighborhood). May be state or nationally chartered. Credit unions accept deposits of members' savings and transaction. The federal regulator for credit unions is the National Credit Union Administration. Commercial banks are typically limited to acting as dealers in specified high-quality debt obligations, such as those of the federal government. A dealer is an individual or financial firm engaged in the purchase and sale of securities and commodities such as metals, foreign exchange, etc., for its own account and at its own risk as principal (see "Broker/dealer"). Depository institution —Customarily refers to commercial banks, savings institutions, and credit unions, since traditionally the greater part of their funding has been in the form of deposits. Deposits are a customer's funds placed with an institution according to agreed on terms and conditions and represent a credit to the depositor. Derivatives are financial contracts whose value is linked to the price of an underlying commodity or financial variable (such as an interest rate, currency price, or stock index) Ownership of a derivative does not require the holder to actually buy or sell the underlying interest. profit if they can successfully forecast price trends. Examples include futures contracts, options, and swaps. It may be used to relieve temporary cash shortages at banks and other depository institutions. Borrowers are expected to have tried to borrow elsewhere first and must provide collateral as security for loans. The term derives from the practice whereby bankers would come to a Reserve Bank teller window to obtain credit in the early days of the Federal Reserve System. The phrase refers to the Dual banking system, which is a system of multiple banks. the fact that banks may be either federally or state chartered. Exchange — A central marketplace with established rules and regulations where buyers and sellers meet to trade futures and options contracts or securities. Federal safety net — A broad term referring to protection of banking institutions through deposit insurance, discount window credit, other lender of last resort support, and certain forms of regulations to reduce risk. Commercial and industrial companies generally lack any of the above-listed safety net protection measures for banks and other commercial and industrial firms. A holding company form authorized by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( P.L. 106-102 ) that goes beyond the limits a of bank holding company. It can control one or more banks, securities firms, and insurance companies as permitted by law and/or regulation. Federal Open Market Committee —Its members are the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and certain of the presidents of Federal Reserve Banks. It oversees market conditions and implements monetary policy through such means as setting interest rates. Financial institutions are differentiated by the manner in which they invest their funds: in loans, bonds, stocks, or some combination; as well as by their sources of funds. Depository financial institutions may accept deposits which are federally insured against loss to the depositor. Non-depository financial institution such as life and property/casualty insurance companies, pension funds, and mutual funds obtain funds through other types of receipts, whose values may fluctuate with market conditions. Financial subsidiary —Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( P.L. 106-102 ), both financial subsidiary and financial subsidiary. national and state-chartered banks are authorized to form financial subsidiaries to engage in activities that would not otherwise be permitted within the bank itself, subject to certain limits. The law provides a mechanism between the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve to decide what is an appropriate new financial activity for a financial subsidiary. Financial Stability Oversight Council — A council created by the Dodd-Frank Act ( P.L. 111-203 ) with identifying and monitoring systemic risks to the U.,S. financial system, reducing expectations of extraordinary government intervention. respond to emerging threats to U.S. financial stability. Firewalls —Barriers to the flow of capital, information, management, and other resources among business units owned by a common entity. In case of financial distress of one operation ("fire"), the "walls" are intended to prevent the spread of loss to the other units. Example: losses in a securities subsidiary of a holding company could not be covered by any of the holding company's bank subsidiaries. Foreign bank —Banks and their holding companies headquartered in other countries may have a variety of financial operations in the United States. Federal Reserve is primary federal regulator. States and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may also regulate them. Government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) is private company with government charters. Government sponsorship typically gives them a funding advantage over purely private competitors. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( P.L. 106-102 ) called for more functional regulation than in the past. In the U.S. banks are regulated based on activity ("function") rather than organizational structure. computing the value of assets for purposes of capital, segregation, or margin requirements. Hedge funds are pools of invested money that buy and sell stocks and bonds and many other assets, including precious metals, commodities, foreign currencies, and derivatives. Hedging —Investing with a hedge fund is similar to buying and selling shares of a stock or bond with the intention of betting on its future price rising or falling. It is illegal to sell shares of hedge funds with the intent of profiting from their losses. Hedging instrument gains value as the hedged item loses value, and vice versa. Illiquid Assets —Assets that cannot be easily or quickly sold. Insolvent —A firm whose liabilities exceed its assets. Institutional regulation —Regulation that is institution-specific as contrasted with activity specific (see "Functional regulation"). Investment banking functions include underwriting (marketing newly registered securities to individual or institutional investors), counseling regarding merger and acquisition proposals, brokerage services, advice on corporate financing. A holding company for securities firms authorized under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Such holding companies are subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The issuing of securities, where the proceeds accrue to the issuer, is distinct from the secondary, or resale, market. Lender of last resort —Governmental lender that acts as the ultimate source of credit in the financial system. In the United States, the Fed has this role. Leverage —The ability of a company or bank to make a profit by proprietary trading. to control large dollar amounts of a commodity or security with a comparatively small amount of capital. Leverage can be obtained through borrowing or the use of derivatives. Liquidity risk —The possibility that the market for normally-liquid assets will suddenly dry up, leaving firms unable to convert assets into cash. Also, the risk that other firms will refuse to extend credit on any of the firms listed. The ability to trade an asset quickly without significantly affecting its price, or the condition of a market with many buyers and sellers present. terms to a firm that is perceived as distressed. Mark-to-Market — The process by which the reported amount of an asset is adjusted to reflect true the market value. Market risk — The risk that the price of a tradeable security or asset will decline, resulting in a loss to the holder. Money market mutual fund (MMF)—A form of mutual fund that pools funds of individuals and other investors for investment in high-grade, short-term debt and bank deposits paying market rates of return. Mortgage-backed security (MBS) is a bond backed by a pool of mortgage loans. The bondholders receive a share of the interest and principal payments on the underlying mortgages. The cash flows may be divided among different cash flows. Most MMFs offer check-writing redemption features. The tendency of people to take more risks once another party has agreed to provide protection. Regulatory interventions to bail out failing firms are often said to create moral hazard, on the assumption that others will expect to be saved from their mistakes, too.

Summary:
Following the September 11, 2001, attack on the WTC, FEMA provided funding to HHS to establish certain WTC health programs. The four programs are the FDNY WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program; the NY/NJ WTC Consortium; HHS’s WTC Federal Responder Screening Program; and the WTC Health Registry. FEMA entered into interagency agreements with HHS agencies, such as NIOSH, ASPR, and ATSDR to distribute funding to implement health screening and monitoring programs for responders and other affected groups. Many workers and volunteers worked for extended periods of time without sufficient respite. Some of them did not have training in disaster response and were therefore more vulnerable to the stress of the event. Despite the early recognition of the need for mental health services, the mental health status of responders did not receive as much attention as it should have.and monitoring could improve the ability to accurately diagnose physical and mental health conditions and prevent more serious mental health problems from developing. The World Trade Center disaster was an unprecedented, highly traumatizing event. initially as their physical health status. Mount Sinai School of Medicine is one of the clinical centers in the NY/NJ WTC Consortium. The mental health status of responders was initially assessed with a short written questionnaire, and depending on a person’s score, individuals were referred for an in-person clinical mental health evaluation. Recognizing the seriousness of mental health problems among responders, the Mount Sinai school of Medicine Department of Psychiatry sought private funding from the Robin Hood Foundation. The program is federally funded. to develop a broader mental health component to the screening program. With the additional funds, the program was able to develop and use a more extensive mental health questionnaire and have a trained mental health professional conduct in-person interviews. Such programs can improve the ability to accurately diagnose and differentiate physical and mental health conditions. For example, gastrointestinal problems can sometimes be a sign of psychological stress. Timely mental health screening can help identify and treat mental and physical health conditions, experts say. For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or see www.samaritans.org. and monitoring can also prevent some mental health conditions from progressing to more serious disorders. For example, obtaining treatment for mild depression might prevent a major depressive disorder from developing. Before federal funding became available in fiscal year 2006 to pay for treatment of responders’ health effects, WTC health program officials told us that it was a challenge to find providers who would treat responders whose screening or monitoring examination was done. Including a treatment referral process in screening and monitoring programs could improve the ability of responders to gain access to needed treatment. Some responders required additional diagnosis or treatment for physical or mental health conditions. The FDNY WTC program was able to refer firefighters to its Bureau of Health Services, which provided treatment. The NY/NJ WTC Consortium did not have a similar option. Officials from this program said that identifying providers available and willing to treat participants was a major part of their operations. It was especially difficult when participants lacked health insurance, which was often the cause of some of the problems. For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or see www.samaritans.org. HHS officials, clinicians involved with the WTC health programs, and other experts said that an integral part of screening and monitoring is the establishment of a linkage to treatment services. Some indicated that as professionals they also felt an ethical obligation to be able to refer people in. Case study: WTC responders who carried out cleanup services after the WTC attack often did not have health insurance, according to a labor official. Case case: WTC workers who were construction workers often lost their health insurance when they became too ill to work the number of days required for coverage. need of care to treatment services. Screening and monitoring programs for responders to the WTC disaster were set up as separate programs. Making comparable services available to all responders, regardless of their employer or geographic location, could ensure more equitable access to services for responders. Data collected about responders’ health are consistent and comprehensive, the NIMH says. The agency says providers who identified a need for treatment during screening examinations acquired a responsibility to provide access to care. The NIMh says it has no plans to change its screening and monitoring program. on the basis of the responder’s employer and geographic location. The types of services available and information collected about responders varied by program. From 2002 until summer 2007, NIOSH did not consistently ensure the availability of screening and monitoring services for nonfederal responders residing outside the NYC area. For example, from August 2004 to August 2007, the FDNY WTC program and the NY/NJ WTC Consortium provided an initial screening examination followed by monitoring examinations every 18 months for firefighters and other workers and volunteers. until June 2005, NIOSH did not fund any organization to provide screening or monitoring services outside the NYC metropolitan area for nonfederal responders. Responders who traveled to NYC from around the country following the attack have testified before the Congress about having difficulty receiving services. Because the WTC Federal Responder Screening Program collected only limited data, less is known about the health effects experienced by federal responders. Officials involved with the WTC health programs have recognized the value of designing responder health programs that provide comparable services to all responders. NIOSH took steps to increase the availability of services to nonfederal responders outside the NYC metropolitan area. In June 2007 it arranged for QTC Management, Inc., to provide screening and monitoring examinations nationwide for 1 year. In March 2008, CDC issued a request for organizations to indicate their interest in coordinating a national program for WTC responders that would ensure that all WTC responders who reside outside of NYC have access to federally funded screening, monitoring, and other services. For more information, visit www.nihos.org. In the event of a future disaster, providing comparable services to all responders would ensure more equitable access to services. This could help ensure that responders receive timely care for conditions and illnesses related to the disaster. HHS has taken steps to ensure thatresponders are registered, but it has not developed a program to ensure consistency in program design. In addition, ensuring that programs collect data that are consistent and comprehensive would help ensure data collection is comprehensive and consistent. For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or see www.samaritans.org. ATSDR has developed a survey instrument that state and local entities can voluntarily adopt to register responders. ASPR is also taking steps to establish a system to register HHS employees and certain other volunteers, but it has not completed its effort. HHS has not developed a department-level plan for designing and implementing responder health programs that incorporates the lessons from the WTC health programs. In the absence of a plan, NIOSH developed a plan for responding to emergency situations in the emergency room and community. a proposal for a project to develop strategies to ensure responder safety and health. NIOSH’s project would address some aspects of the lessons from the WTC health programs. A Rapid Response Registry (RRR) survey instrument that state and local entities can voluntarily adopt to register responders and other individuals exposed to a disaster. The RRR survey instrument, a two-page form that can be distributed in paper or electronic format, is designed to collect information that would enable officials to inform individuals about follow-up health services. ATSDR established a contract with Research Triangle Institute International (RTI) to support state and local efforts to implement the RRR survey instrument during responses to disasters. RTI’s responsibilities include providing information to the entire at-risk population on how to enroll in the R RR. The RRR is intended to collect basic demographic and health information, including contact information; exposure information; and information on exposure-related health effects, immediate health and safety needs, and health insurance. According to research studies. As of February 2008, 21 states had included the RRR survey in their disaster planning. NIOSH has also taken some steps that relate to the registering of responders. In 2005, NIOSH posted interim guidance on its Web site to help occupational health and other clinicians conduct postexposure medical screening of workers leaving hurricane disaster recovery areas. The data would be collected and maintained by state or local entities with ATSDR’s and RTI’S assistance. The instrument has been shared with other federal agencies, all state health departments, and local response organizations. guidance states that all responders should receive some basic screening services. identity and contact information should be obtained on their completion of or return from response activities. ASPR is required under the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act to register federal public health and medical personnel who are deployed under the Secretary of HHS’s authority. It has not completed efforts to ensure that these responders would be registered in the event of an outbreak. The guidance outlines minimum screening information needs, including contact information, health status information and exposure information. HHS has not developed a department-level plan for designing and implementing responder health programs that incorporates the five lessons from the WTC health programs. Thousands of responders to the WTC disaster have experienced serious physical and mental health problems as a result of their response and recovery efforts. HHS has not indicated whether its policies and actions following a disaster or emergency would apply these lessons, such as by building epidemiologic research into the design of screening and monitoring services. Until HHS completes this work, responders to a future disaster could be vulnerable to health problems.

DHS’s efforts to strengthen and integrate its management functions have resulted in progress addressing our criteria for removal from the high-risk list. In our February 2015 high- Risk update report, we found that DHS had met two criteria and partially met the remaining three criteria. DHS subsequently met an additional criterion—establishing a framework for monitoring progress—and therefore as of March 2016, has met three criteria, as shown in table 1. We concluded in our 2015 report and continue to believe that it will be important for DHS to maintain its current level of top leadership support.

Summary:
In the last 10 years social media has played an increasing role in emergencies and disasters in both the public and private sectors. Social media can be used as an output to disseminate public safety related information and as an emergency management tool through the use of inputs. For example, during Hurricane Gustav, a Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) used social media to send mass email notifications. Notifications can also be sent to mobilize first responders to respond to an incident. Using social media for mobilization purposes can be particularly useful when traditional call systems fail. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Personal Localized Alerting Network known as "PLAN" (technically the Commercial Mobile Alert System, or CMAS) Implemented in 2011, PLAN expands the emergency alert system notifications sent over TV and radio to include mobile and smart phones. PLAN sends geographically targeted alerts through cell towers in the form of text-like messages to the cell phones of people who have requested to be notified in the event of an emergency. It also includes searchable hashtags and links to more information on the agency's website. target emergency alerts to specific geographic areas, which then push the information to dedicated receivers with PLAN-enabled mobile devices. Over 150 entities, including 75 counties, 25 states, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, have access to the IPAWS-OPEN gateway. The gateway allows them to transmit messages to cellular phones (using Wireless Emergency Alerts or WEA), radio and television (using the Emergency Alert System), and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) The gateway was developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which oversees development and operation of the system. The NWS can send weather alerts, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children can send AMBER alerts over IPAWS. Social media can also be used by users to let family and friends know they are safe if they are near an incident or natural disaster. For example an estimated 3.5 million tweets with the hashtag #sandy were generated in 24 hours during Hurricane Sandy and roughly ten pictures per second were uploaded using Instagram.weather radios. In addition to alerts and messages sent by emergency management and governmental organizations, valuable crisis information is often disseminated by citizens. Social media can also use inputs to provide unique emergency and disaster information. For example, Facebook activated a feature called "safety check" during the Paris terrorist attacks to allow users to post if they are safe or not in the area of an incident. Crowdsourcing consists of obtaining needed services, ideas, or content by soliciting contributions from people. The above are examples of how information is disseminated through outputs. For more information on how to use social media to help in a crisis or disaster, visit www.disaster.org. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) "Did You Feel It?" project creates automatic intensity maps based on "felt" reports submitted online. More than 2 million reports have been filed on this website, with 40 earthquakes receiving more than 10,000 reports each. Another useful source of information during an incident are crisis maps. Crisis maps combine information scattered across the Internet along with other information and places them on a single map. Users can use the crisis map to ascertain storm paths and flood zones, as well as identify flood zones. evacuation routes, shelter locations, and power outage areas. Information posted at the time of an event could be valuable later for investigative and research purposes. For example, viewers at the 2012 theater shooting in Aurora, CO, tweeted and posted messages moments before the attack took place. Forensic analysis of the information was used to construct incident timelines and retrieve first-hand accounts of the event as it unfolded. Social media is used to alert emergency managers and officials to certain situations. Monitoring information flows help establish "situational awareness" First responders can leverage social media to enhance situational awareness and assist in decision-making. Obtaining real-time information as an incident unfolds can help officials determine where people are located and assess victim needs. Emergency managers can also use the information to direct certain resources to reduce damages, loss of life, or both. In some cases it might be a good idea to use social media as a tool to communicate and gather and share real- time, dynamic information, such as on social media sites such as Twitter. Social media is increasingly altering emergency communications. Information can flow in multiple directions (known as backchannel communications) Social media are increasingly seen by some as a supplement or replacement to "911" emergency system lines and can be particularly useful when there is a disaster in the area. The public can now use social media to get information before first responders reach the disaster area. It is.possible to obtain this information beforefirst responders arrive in a disaster area, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. traditional forms of communication are not available. The use of social media to request assistance is likely to become more common. According to a study by the American Red Cross, younger people generally use social media more frequently than older segments of society. They are also more likely to request help through social media, believe agencies should monitor their postings, and have high expectations that agencies will respond quickly to their requests. There are also indications that older adults are increasingly using social media. As more older adults usesocial media, they too may develop similar expectations. Emergency managers and officials may need to embrace social media technology in order to be responsive to the public's needs. Social media has also played a role after an incident through recovery efforts. At the federal level, social media is commonly used to provide information concerning what types of assistance is available to individuals and households. At state and local level, groups are using social media to manage donations and organize volunteer efforts. Some may question the feasibility of taking requests through social media—particularly during periods when there is a high volume of incoming information. how to apply for assistance, announce application deadlines, and provide information and links to other agencies and organizations that provide recovery assistance. Social media could be used to raise funds in such cases through private contributions. However, it would not likely be capable of supplanting federal assistance altogether. Recovery from large-scale disasters can cost billions of dollars (the federal government provided approximately $120 billion and $50 billion in supplemental funding in 2012). In some cases, individuals and households do not qualify for FEMA Individual Assistance (IA) grants. Smart phones and tablets can be used to send images of damaged structures. The Army Corps of Engineers has used a smart phone application to identify and report breeches, seepage, overtoppings, and other areas of structural weakness in levees. The application allows the Corps to take a photo of problem areas and then "geotag" its precise location. According to Corps officials, the application has helped improve the efficiency of the Corps' damage estimate process.for Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy respectively. speed, and accuracy of detecting and responding to levee failures. In addition, the application has also helped reduce human error by reducing instances of mislabeling or misreporting problems. Within the past decade, reports on successful use of social media during emergencies and disasters have spurred congressional interest and policy discussions. Much of the congressional and executive branch interest has centered on how social media can be used to improve disaster response and recovery capabilities. On May 5, 2011, Craig Fugate, the FEMA Administrator, testified before the Senate Committee on Emergency Preparedness. Fugate met with representatives from Apple, Craigslist, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Twitter to discuss how to harness the "capabilities of the digital world to better serve the public" Possible future applications include using smartphone-friendly mobile versions of FEMA websites to allow users to access information, request assistance, and facilitate communication between citizens, first responders, volunteer groups, the private sector, and all levels of government. Subsequent hearings were held by the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications Committee on Homeland Security. Crowdsourcing information can be geotagged with longitude and latitude coordinates. The hearings also explored how social media was transforming preparedness, response, and recovery efforts in the private sector and how lessons learned in these sectors might be applied at the federal level. Lessons learned were also discussed as well as how crowdsourcing can be used to enhance the quality and timeliness of critical information. According to Mathew Stepka, Vice President, Technology for Social Impact for Google, during some disasters, authoritative sources may not have been available. as expansive information as individuals who are experiencing the incident first-hand. Stepka provided an example of crowdsourcing in his testimony to the Subcommittee. During Sandy, a group of student volunteers called stations in New Jersey to check whether they were open and had gas available. Within a few days they had data for more than 1,000 different stations, which was fed into our Sandy crisis map automatically. The Department of Energy's call center ended up referencing this information. Study findings reported at the bottom of the page. The American Red Cross found that 20% of Americans received some form of emergency information from an app. 76% of American expect help within three hours of posting a request on social media. 40% would use social media to inform others they were safe. The study also found that roughly 40% of people would use a social media app to report that they were in a safe place. The figures are higher than the percentages reported (68% and 24% respectively) in their 2011 survey. The survey also finds that roughly 25% of those surveyed would use an app in the future. 75% of social media users use the medium to seek information about an incident. One noteworthy finding from the hearings was a reported need to enhance public and private partnerships. Legislation to address this need was introduced in the 113 th Congress and later in the 114 th Congress. H.R. 623 , which was enacted on November 5, 2015 ( P.L. 114-80 , the DHS Social Media Improvement Act of 2015) amended the Homeland Security Act of 2014. The bill was passed with bipartisan support. Act of 2002 to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish a social media working group. The law requires the social media group to submit an annual report to Congress. The report includes a review of current and emerging social media technologies being used to support preparedness and response activities related to terrorist attacks and other emergencies. A review of best practices and lessons learned on the use of social media during the response to terrorist Attacks and Other emergencies that occurred during the period covered by the report. recommendations to improve DHS's social media efforts. use of social media for emergency management purposes. improve public awareness of the type of information being disseminated through social media. improve information sharing among DHS and its components and among state and local governments. A review of available training for government officials on the use of social social media in response to a terrorist attack or other emergency. and a summary of coordination efforts with the private sector to discuss and resolve legal, operational, technical, privacy, and security concerns. Another bill introduced in the House of Representatives. 114 th Congress, H.R. 3517, requires the DHS Secretary to conduct a one-year pilot program with the American Red Cross. The program would research and develop mechanisms to better leverage social media to improve preparedness and response capabilities. It would include timely dissemination of public preparedness information for terrorist attacks and other disasters, and the delivery of response supplies to affected areas. The bill requires the Homeland Security Secretary to issue a report to the House and Senate no later than 90 days after completion of the pilot program. H.R. 3517 was referred to the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications. This list is not exhaustive—there are many federal entities that use social media for emergencies and disasters in various capacities. The federal government does not use a single platform for emergency and disasters. Rather, federal entities use different social media. for different purposes. Some have platforms dedicated to emergency and disaster preparedness and response, while others have dedicated social media platforms for other purposes. The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee is considering the bill. emergencies and disasters while others have emergency and disaster information comingled with other agency information. When possible statistics on social media use are provided; however, not all entities collect such data. It is important to note that social media is subject to rapid advances in applications and technologies. New uses are being adopted on a continual basis. Social media products typically require digitally signing terms of service agreements. Many terms ofService agreements are, however, incompatible with federal law, policies, and other laws. Federal agencies have negotiated federal-compatible terms of service agreements with social media vendors. The Government Services Administration provides government-wide support, training, and assistance with various social media platforms. Doing so allows FEMA to quickly create a Facebook page, upload pictures and videos, or post information. In FEMA's case, the agency developed negotiated terms ofService agreements with varioussocial media outlets. Do you have a social media problem? Share it with FEMA by emailing jennifer.smith@dailymail.co.uk. FEMA began using Youtube in 2006, Twitter in 2008, and Facebook in 2009. FEMA also uses social media to inform people where and how to apply for federal and nongovernmental assistance. FEMA can use social media as an emergency management tool by integrating various social media platforms through the use of tools referred to as "social media management systems" FEMA has staff responsible for day-to-day social media operations but has the capacity to deploy people from Regional Offices for surge support during disasters. SBA utilizes social media on several different platforms including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and blogs. Each SBA region has its own Twitter account to provide users with specific local information. Using social media SBA will often provide links to information on their website for more technical information and may link and share posts from FEMA and other agencies. SBA thinks of their social media as part of their larger digital engagement with users. and to help repair, rebuild, and recover from economic losses after a declared disaster. outreach, approximately 1.6 million people have subscribed to SBA's e-newsletter online. SBA comingles emergency and disaster information with other information about small business programs on their social media platforms. HHS directs and coordinates preparedness activities and oversees public health agencies within the Department with responsibilities for emergency preparedness and response. These include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Agency for Healthcare. HHS uses a variety of social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter. In particular, social media plays an integral role in HHS's National Health and Security Strategy. HHS also provides health information through social media during incidents and directs people to health resources through web links and hashtags. HHS does not use dedicated web pages for incidents and does not collect data on social media usage. Each subentity of HHS contains working groups with separate social media efforts that that are separate from each other and do not share data. focus on their particular organizational mission and goals. The HHS working group is relatively small but has capacity to surge if needed for large incidents. The working group monitors social media to dispel rumors, obtain situational awareness, and answer questions about preparedness and public health issues. HHS does not respond to immediate requests for assistance. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) works with states and localities, as well as other nations to detect, investigate, and prevent disease and injury, to develop and implement prevention. strategies, to monitor the effect of environmental conditions on health, and to study illness and injury in the workplace. CDC responds and supports state and local efforts to save lives and reduce suffering when a disaster occurs. CDC also helps states and localities recover and restore public health functions after the initial response to an incident. CDC uses Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, and YouTube among other social media platforms. In some cases, CDC has a number of profiles on each platform (for example,CDC has 30 different Facebook profiles and over 60 Twitter profiles addressing various public health topics). does not use incident-specific social media accounts, but does have web pages for specific incidents. In an emergency, CDC coordinates with other federal entities, state and local agencies, and partners through the emergency operations center. CDC uses a handful of social media staff in an emergency event, but has the capacity to surge if needed. During the 2014 Ebola response, the social media team used a number of different social media platforms to answer questions and obtain situational awareness. CDC does not respond to individual requests for assistance. Social Media Council consists of 15-20 individuals representing program areas within CDC. Oversight for CDC social media is carried out by the Social Media Council. During an emergency, social media information is coordinated through CDC's Joint Information Center (JIC) The National Guard is both a state and federal organization: it is simultaneously the organized militia of a state or territory and a reserve component of the Army and the Air Force. Due to its size (over 450,000 individuals), trained personnel, and available. The National Guard operates in a state status, under the control of state and territorial governors. In this state capacity, National Guard personnel are not subject to the restrictions of the Posse Comitatus Act. Under certain conditions, the National Guard can also be activated to respond to emergencies and disasters under Title 32 of the U.S. Code. Guard personnel who are activated under Title. 32 can perform law enforcement functions. The National Guard is frequently used for emergency response, and has a wide range of equipment. The National Guard Bureau (NGB) is a joint activity of the Department of Defense. It serves as the channel of communications between the Departments of the Army and Air Force and the states on all matters pertaining to the National Guard. NGB operates its social media efforts out of its public affairs office to educate and inform the public about National Guard preparedness and response efforts. It uses a variety of social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Instagram, and YouTube.32 remain under state control, but pay and benefits are provided by the federal government. also uses social media through internal pages to conduct internal communications. For example, uploaded images of damages posted by social media users are circulated internally to help understand the extent of damages caused by an incident. The images, however, are not used for damage estimates. The National Guard Bureau also monitors social media for situational awareness, and rumor control. Policy guidance for the NGB's use of social media is outlined in the Department of Defense's "Web and Internet-Based Capabilities (IBC) Policies. National Guard uses response-specific analytics to help make data-driven decisions with respect to future applications of social media for emergencies and disasters. The National Guard Bureau does not use disaster specific web pages and does not respond to individual requests for assistance. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) provides emergency response activities through more than 40 planning and response teams (PRTs) These deployable teams have been specifically trained to perform USACE emergency response functions, including provision of emergency power, debris removal and temporary housing. USACE social media platforms include Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Youtube, and Pinterest. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers synchronizes outgoing information across the platforms and coordinates with other federal agencies such as FEMA and NWS. In general, the Emergency Operations Center and the Joint Field Office for each incident have external affairs personnel with social media responsibilities. USACE does not use incident-specific web pages or respond to individual requests. The text box at right provides composite data and provides a link to the full report. results for FY2015. The NWS is a component of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration within the Department of Commerce. The social media platforms used by the NWS mainly consist of Twitter and Facebook. Each of the Weather Service's 122 weather forecast offices, along with other specialized field offices, national centers, and regional and national headquarters utilize social media. It is not specific to disaster or emergency related posts. It provides weather, water, and climate data, as well as forecasts and warnings for the protection of life and property. The NWS does not have incident specific pages, but does use social media outlets to address specific threats. Local users can follow a field office for more specific information to their local area or the headquarter account for national or general information. The NWS may utilize social media to let users know a hurricane is approaching a particular area and that people should prepare for dangerously high wind and flooding. Following the event, they may assist the emergency response community by providing critical post-event information that aids in emergency response efforts. NWS mainly uses social media as a tool to provide information about weather events to users. In some instances the field offices utilize social media information in conjunction with traditional spotter reports to identify and confirm weather events. Following significant meteorological or hydrological events, NWS conducts Service Assessments to evaluate NWS products and services before, during, and after events. Every NWS Service Assessment since 2011 has included sections on the NWS's social media use. For an example, an assessment following a severe thunderstorm was conducted on social media. Hurricane/Post-Tropical Cyclone Sandy praised the NWS's use of social media. The NWS also sends out Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) to mobile phone users within a close proximity of a critical weather event. These alerts are 90 characters in length and may include information on the weather event and suggestions like " take shelter " or " avoid flood areas " As previously mentioned, surveys indicate that many citizens expect help from government agencies in the event of a disaster. within three hours of posting a request on social media. Some jurisdictions may not yet have the capacity or resources to meet this expectation. Others might argue that this expectation is unrealistic, particularly during large-scale disasters, due to the potential volume of incoming messages and posts. They may further argue that some jurisdictions do not have the capabilities to effectively monitor social media for incoming requests for assistance. For example, according to the West Virginia State Police, citizens should not use social media to request immediate help because they don't have the manpower and resources to monitor its. Congress could explore the feasibility of using social media to make requests. Congress could also investigate the use of a pilot program that would allow people to request assistance through social media. The program could then be evaluated to determine its effectiveness. A key issue of interest would be how to use social media around the clock. The use of social media as a tool to ask for assistance would be similar to a call to 911. It could also help state, local, and federal jurisdictions develop their capacity to receive and effectively respond to the requests. A potential method that could be used to accelerate diffusion is through public-private partnerships (PPPs) A PPP is a contractual arrangement whereby the private sector would assume more responsibility than is traditional for the development and design of new technologies. Once developed, the new technology would be shared with the public sector. In the case of social media for emergencies and disasters, Congress should use PPPs to accelerate the diffusion of new technology, the report says. The report is based on a report by the U.S. Institute of Peace. could consider providing grants to the private sector or investigate other methods that would help foster partnerships between the private and public sectors. FEMA provides a number of tools and models to help organizations start emergency management PPPs. Proponents would likely argue they would inject additional resources in to the development of social media as a tool for emergency management, increase private sector involvement, potentially reduce costs and project delivery times, and reduce public sector risk. Some argue that government agencies can potentially achieve what private sector agencies can not. more objectives more efficiently through PPPs than they could on their own. Detractors, on the other hand, might argue that P PPs are complicated arrangements and require too much oversight. They may also be concerned about potential fraud and abuse of technology grants. Instances of inaccurate and false information may be an inherent problem given the nature of social media platforms and the number of people disseminating information. There have been studies that found that outdated, inaccurate, or false information had been disseminated via social media forums during disasters. Inaccurate information could jeopardize the safety of first responders and the community. The extent to which inaccurate information poses a problem to the emergency management community is not clear. Some studies have concluded that social media information is generally accurate; suggesting that reports about the spread of misinformation during incidents may have been exaggerated. In addition to inaccurate information, too much information can also pose a problem. As a disaster or crisis unfolds, the amount of information generated by users can be enormous. Sifting through this information can be difficult. Unofficial sources are often trusted and used as information sources by the general public. This is because citizens may think official sources are too slow, general, or inaccurate. Some reports have indicated that information from unofficial sources can be just as, and even more desirable than information from official social media websites. The volume and speed with which available information is disseminated, combined with an inability to identify, verify, coordinate, aggregate, and contextualize it can leave this information unused and ultimately, unactionable. The number of people using Twitter and Facebook spike during disasters because they are searching immediate information they cannot find on traditional broadcast channels. Congress could investigate the accuracy of emergency and disaster information and examine strategies and best practices that could increase organizational capacity to handle a large influx of information. Similarly, Congress could examine methods that could be used to ensure that emergency information is accurate, timely and accurate to the public.

Malicious use of social media during an incident could range from mischievous pranks to acts of terrorism. One tactic that has been used by terrorists involves the use of a secondary attack after an initial attack to kill and injure first responders. Social media could be used as a tool for such purposes by issuing calls for assistance to an area, or notifying officials of a false hazard or threat that could be posed.help prevent or reduce the spread of misinformation. There is some concern that individuals or organizations might intentionally provide inaccurate information to confuse, disrupt, or otherwise thwart response efforts. Many smartphones and tablets have battery lives lasting twelve hours or less depending on their use. In some cases disaster survivors will not have the means to recharge their devices. In other cases, the device may have adequate power, but cellular towers in the area do not, significantly limiting their use in the event of a disaster.requires a response. When using social media for situational awareness and response efforts, officials and first responders should be aware it could be used for malicious purposes and develop measures to mitigate those possibilities. Congress could require FEMA to develop and deploy 3G and 4G mobile networks in presidentially declared disasters. Congress could also consider other methods that would help residents recharge their devices during power outages. We encourage the subcommittee to explore innovative solutions to provide deployable 3/4G mobile Networks. Without both, social media is useless without power and connectivity, the subcommittee says. The subcommittee urges FEMA to provide 3G or 4G networks to the public during large-scale emergencies. It could also provide mobile device charging stations, the panel says. Social media may improve some aspects of emergency and disaster response. Some may be concerned that overreliance on the technology could be problematic under prolonged power outages. Another concern is the potential of overwhelming Internet traffic during crisis situations. For example, Internet traffic in Belgium after the terrorist attacks in Brussels slowed after social media was used in the wake of the attacks. They may argue that traditional forms of communications still need to be used in conjunction with social media. They might also argue that emergency managers and officials consider alternative or backup options during extended powerOutages. Congress could examine whether parts of the U.S. might experience similar problems with Internet traffic. It is unclear how much the federal government is paying for its various social media efforts with respect to emergencies and disasters. The number of personnel required to monitor multiple social media sources, verify the accuracy of incoming information, and respond to and redirect incoming messages is also uncertain. In addition, federal entities may experience a large amount of Internet traffic, which could be difficult to handle. In response, Belgian officials requested that users reduce their Internet consumption. volume of incoming messages from the public during a disaster. Financial information is also useful for congressional oversight of the entities that have received the funds and to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the expenditures. Knowledge concerning federal expenditures on social media use during disasters can help Congress determine how the money has been spent and what resources have been provided to the nation.

Privacy concerns exist about the potential for the collection, retention, and data mining of personal information by the federal government. Others are concerned how the information might be used. The E-Government Act of 2002 mandates that federal agencies conduct an assessment of the privacy impact of any social media use. The use of status alerts and the creation of personal pages to establish situational awareness may raise privacy concerns.identify cost saving opportunities. For example, would the government compile records after a terrorist attack to help investigate certain individuals? Section 208 of the E-Government Act requires federal agencies to complete PIAs. The PIA uses the Fair Information Privacy Principles (FIPPs) to assess and mitigate any impact on an individual's privacy. In March 2011, the Department of Homeland Security completed a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) for the U.S. Department of Justice. The document that results from these mandated assessments is called a Privacy impact assessment (Pia) and is called the Privacy Impact assessment (PIAs) for federal agencies. DHS issued a Privacy Impact Assessment for the Use of Unidirectional Social Media Applications Communications and Outreach. The PIA does not cover users sending content to the Department. It describes the personally identifiable information (PII) and the limited circumstances under which DHS will have access to PII. In 2010, DHS published a PIA on the use of Social Networking Interactions and Applications (Communications/Outreach/Public Dialogue). Neither PIA covers other social media. For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or see www.samaritans.org. activity such as monitoring initiatives, law enforcement and intelligence activities, and other similar operations. Some have argued that privacy laws can hamper the use of information obtained from social media during disasters. Such laws restrict how the government can collect, maintain, and use PII. Efforts are being made to develop software that could remove personal information from social social media messages without loss of vital disaster information. Congress could consider amending existing laws to make theUse of PII less restrictive during disasters, or investigate methods that could help the federal government develop software. Social media has made tremendous inroads into emergency management for a variety of reasons. Social media has proven to be a useful method for communicating when traditional forms of communication are ineffective or inoperable. There are strong indications that the use of social media for emergencies and disasters will increase as people continue to embrace new technologies. This increase will lead to a greater expectation that government will meet their information needs during crisis situations through social media. By and large, the federal government uses social media as an output to disseminate information. The emphasis on outputs could prevent the federal government from fully realizing social media's potential as an effective emergency management tool. A different approach would be to reorient the focus with an emphasis on inputs. The reorientation, however, could be a complicated matter. Some might argue that the federal role in social media efforts should be limited because the decentralized nature of social media makes the medium too unwieldy for large, centralized organizations to control. They may further argue that federal involvement might lead to standardization and rigid usage. guidelines which might hinder the nimbleness of social media to be applied in new and novel ways. They may therefore conclude that state and locals should take the lead with social media with the support of the federal government. Some starting points would include pilot programs and public private partnerships. Congress could also require FEMA to develop and deploy 3G and 4G mobile networks in presidentially declared disasters, and provide grants to state and local governments to help them develop their social media capabilities. It could also investigate the use of social social media at the federal level to help inform the public. decisionmaking and policymaking. This could include determining hardware and software costs, personnel costs, surge capacity during large-scale disasters. Congress could also explore ways to address and overcome some of the other challenges described in this report. These challenges include using social media to request assistance, inaccurate or malicious crisis information, information overload, and technical limitations. The federal government's ability to keep pace with advances in and the social media and changing patterns of public usage could also be considered in the report.

Summary:
Mining of hardrock minerals, such as gold, lead, copper, silver, and uranium, was an economic incentive for exploring and settling the American West. When the ore was depleted, miners often left behind a legacy of abandoned mines, structures, safety hazards, and contaminated land and water. BLM, the Forest Service, EPA, and OSM play a role in cleaning up these abandoned mining sites and ensuring that currently operating sites are reclaimed after operations have ceased. Some contaminated hardrock mine sites have been listed on Superfund’s National Priorities list. readily available records or data sources, such as published or unpublished geological reports, mining claim maps, and the Mineral Availability System/Mineral Industry Locator System (MAS/MILS), which states indicated were typically incomplete. Several of those states that relied primarily on literature used the literature only as a starting point, and then estimated the number of features on the basis of experience. For example, while one state estimated that there were about three times the number. of public safety hazards as identified by the literature, another state estimated. there were four times as many. were up to six times as many. As of November 2007, hardrock mining operators had provided financial assurances valued at approximately $982 million. Some states were less readily able to provide the data directly from their systems without manipulation or estimation. For example, New Mexico estimated the number of abandoned mine sites from the data it maintains on hazardous features. Nevada estimated theNumber of abandoned hardrock mine sites from the data it maintains on the number of mining districts in the state. 52 of the 1,463 hardrock mining operations had inadequate financial assurances. The financial assurances for these 52 operations should be more accurately reported as about $61 million less than needed to fully cover estimated reclamation costs. The report also indicates that about $28 million less was needed to cover estimatedReclamation costs for the operations. The operations are located on BLM lands in 11 western states, including California, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. The total number of mining operations on the BLM lands is 1,462. BLM’s approach to determining the adequacy of financial assurances is not useful because it does not clearly lay out the extent to which financial assurances are inadequate. For example, in California, BLM reports that, statewide, the financial assurances in place are $1.5 million greater than required, suggesting reclamation costs are being more than required. In contrast, we totaled the difference between the financial assurance in place for an operation and thefinancial assurances needed for that operation to determine the actual shortfall for each of the 52 operations for which BLM had determined that financial assurances were inadequate. fully covered. However, according to our analysis of only those California operations with inadequate financial assurances, the financial assurances in place are nearly $440,000 less than needed to fully cover reclamations costs. BLM officials said that financial assurances may appear inadequate in the Bond Review Report when expansions or other changes in the operation have occurred. BLM agreed that it would be valuable to report the dollar value of the difference between financial assurances. in place and required for those operations where financial assurances are inadequate and have taken steps to modify LR2000. requiring an increase in the amount of the financial assurance. BLM’s estimate of reclamation costs has increased and there is a delay between when BLM enters the new estimate into LR2000 and when the operator provides the additional bond amount. Conversely, hardrock mining operators may have financial assurances greater than required for a number of reasons. For example, they may increase their financial assurances because they anticipate expanding their hardrock operations. In addition, according to the Bond Review Report, there are about 2.4 times as many notice-level operations. surface disturbance on 5 acres or less. About 99 percent of the value of financial assurances is for plan-level operations. A greater percentage of plan- level operations had inadequate financial assurances. Over one-third of the number of all hardrock operations and about 84 percent of  value of all all BLM operations were inadequate for financial assurances, according to the report. The report was published by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management on Wednesday, November 14. For confidential support call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or visit http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/. financial assurances are for hardrock mining operations located in Nevada. See appendix IV for further details on the number of plan- and notice-level operations in each state. I would be happy to respond to any questions that you or Members of the Committee may have. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this testimony. For further information about this testimony, please contact Robin M. Nazzaro, Director, Natural Resources and Environment (202) 512-3841. We interviewed officials at the BLM, the Forest Service, EPA, and OSM. We obtained data on total expenditures for cleaning up and reclaiming abandoned hardrock mine sites. We reviewed agency documents, budget justification reports and reports detailing agencies’ cleanup efforts and programs. We interviewed officials involved with the abandoned mine cleanup programs to understand how they tracked and monitored expenditures to clean up abandonedhardrock mines, and to request and ensure that we would receive the data we needed. We also examined relevant legislation and regulations to determine the value and coverage of financial assurances operators use to guarantee reclamation costs. The data were compiled from BLM’s Financial Accounting and Reporting System, EPA's Superfund eFacts Database, OSM's Abandoned Mine Land Inventory System, and Forest Service officials. Because the four agencies’ abandoned hardrock mine programs started in different years, start years for expenditure data vary. BLM officials told us that in addition to the expenditure data they provided, the agency receives funding allocations from other sources, such as the Department of the Interior's Central Hazardous Materials fund. through 2007. Forest Service’s data, for fiscal years 1996 through 2007. EPA’S data, from fiscal years 1988 through 2007; and OSM’ s data from 1993 to 2007. We presented these data for the past 10 years (1998 through 2007) because of variability in the program start year across the agencies. Some data recording errors in early years at some agencies also contributed to the lack of year-by-year presentation. We performed a limited reliability assessment of the expenditure data. in 2008 constant dollars. Because of limited time in preparing this testimony, we were unable to fully assess the reliability of the agencies’ expenditure data. We concluded that the data are appropriate as used and presented to meet our objectives because we (1) attribute the data to what agencies report as their expenditures, (2) present rounded data to minimize the perception of precision, and (3) do not base any conclusions or recommendations on the data. To answer our second objective, we summarized selected prior survey efforts by federal agencies and organizations. to document differences in estimates, definitions, and methodologies. We consulted experts in mining and abandoned mine land programs. We then provided states with an edit-controlled data collection instrument that requested data specifically tailored to our definitions and methods. Features that pose a significant hazard to public health and safety include features, such as mine openings, structures, and highwalls; and impoundments that poses a threat to public safety. The definition we ultimately chose was clear and incorporated enough flexibility for all major hardrock mining states to reasonably comply. to public health and safety and require actions to secure, remedy or reclaim. Sites with environmental degradation include features that lead to environmental degradation, and, consequently, require remediation of air, water, or ground pollution. Most states do not maintain environmental degradation data by feature, states could only speculate about this figure, or compute it by estimating an average number of features per site and multiplying that. Rather than reporting, as requested, theNumber of features leading to environmental degradation, most states reported only the number of sites with environmental  degradation. by the overall number of sites with environmental degradation. Because of these limitations with feature-level data, we report only the number of site with data on environmental degradation in order to ensure more reliable and consistent reporting across the states. As a secondary confirmation that states provided data consistent with the definition, our data collection instrument included a section for states to provide a brief description of how the various data points were calculated, and whether the data provided were actual or estimated values. Based on comments in these fields, and basic logic checks, we followed up on the data. as needed through telephone interviews to clarify and confirm problematic responses. To answer our third objective—to determine the value and coverage of financial assurances in place to guarantee coverage of reclamation costs— we requested the BLM Bond. Using these final edited data, we calculated the estimated number of abandoned mine sites, the number of features that pose physical safety and environmental hazards in the 12 western states and Alaska. Our definitional and editing processes provided us with reasonable assurance that the data were as clean and consistent as possible. Review Report from BLM’s Legacy Rehost System 2000 (LR2000) database. Because we had previously reported reliability problems with data on financial assurances in LR2000, we conducted a limited reliability assessment of the bond report data. This limited assessment included (1) basic logic checks on the data we received, (2) interviews with BLM minerals management officials knowledgeable of the changes made to LR2000. Although the data are of undetermined reliability, our limited assessment indicates that they are reliable. that management controls were improved for the generation of bond review reports from LR2000. We concluded that the data are appropriate as used and presented, and we did not base any conclusions or recommendations on these data. This appendix provides information on federal expenditures used to clean up abandoned hardrock mines by fiscal year (table 5) and by state (table 6).

It includes information on the number of financial assurances in place for hardrock operations on BLM lands in 11 western states. It also includes the value of these financial assurances by state. The report also includes information of the differences between financial assurance requirements and actual value of financial assurance in place in each state. It concludes with an analysis of the difference between the requirements and the actual value for notice- and plan-level operations in that state.

Summary:
From October 1, 2010, until the enactment of this legislation on April 11, 2011, the legislative branch operated on continuing resolutions. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 ( P.L. 112-10 ) provided $4.54 billion for legislative branch activities for FY2011. The legislative branch represents approximately 0.4% of the total discretionary appropriations provided in this act. The House and Senate adopted language in the 112 th Congress affecting spending within each chamber. No further action on this bill occurred as of the date of this report. The FY2008 budget authority represented a decrease of 8.1% from the $449.9 million (including supplemental appropriations) provided in FY2007. The FY2012 request and FY2011 funding level for each of the AOC accounts is presented in Table 8. At a hearing on March 3, 2011, the Senate subcommittee discussed the timing of repairs to the Capitol dome; the completion of the tunnel project, scheduled for 2012; and potential savings from a unified legislative branch financial management system. The Capitol Power Plant east chiller relocation project was also discussed. The Consolidated Appropriations Act contains an administrative provision directing the Architect of the Capitol to transfer amounts made available for construction projects to the Capitol Police to reimburse them for overtime expenses related to these projects. The act also contains language transferring a parcel of land from the National Park Service to the architect. CBO is a nonpartisan body that advises Congress on budget matters. The House Appropriations Committee holds a hearing every year on Capitol Hill. The hearing is open to the public and is open only to members of Congress and their staffs. CBO requested $46.9 million for FY2012. House-passed version of H.R. 2551 would have provided $43.8 million. Senate-reported version would've provided $44.4 million. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $43,8 million, a decrease of 6.4%. Previously, previously, CBO had requested $45 million for fiscal year 2012. The agency provides objective economic and budgetary analysis to Congress. It is required to provide cost estimates for any measure reported by a regular or conference committee. $45.2 million was provided for FY2010, $44.1 million in the FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act, and $2.0 million, to remain available through FY2010. CBO requested two administrative provisions for FY2012, neither of which were included in the House-passed or Senate-reported versions of H.R. 2551 or the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The requested provisions would have 1. allowed unobligated balances of expired Congressional Budget Office appropriations for FY 2012 and each fiscal year to stay available until expended for information technology security projects. Congressional Budget Office to be used to pay the compensation of certain employees with non-immigrant visas. At the House hearing on May 11, 2011, the subcommittee discussed CBO's workload, impetus for reports, protocols for determining priorities, process for making long-term projections, and potential consequences of budget cuts on CBO operations. The Senate subcommittee discussed the prioritization of cost estimates; CBO's information technology request; its use of outside specialists. The Library of Congress serves simultaneously as Congress's parliamentary library and the de facto national library of the United States. United States. acquisition, maintenance, and preservation of a collection of more than 147 million items in a wide range of traditional and new media. Administration of U.S. copyright laws by its Copyright Office; and administration of a national program to provide reading material to the blind and physically handicapped. Its direct services to Congress include the provision of legal research and law-related services by the Law Library of Congress, and a broad range of activities by the Congressional Research Service (CRS), including legal research. The Library requested $666.7 million, an increase of $38.1 million (6.1%) from the FY2011 level. The House-passed version of H.R. 2551 would have provided $575.3 million, a decrease of $53.4 million (-8.5%). The Senate-reported version would haveprovided $579.2 million. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $587.3million, a decreases of $41.3m (-6.6%) FY2011 level represented a decrease of $14.7 million (-2.3%) from the $643.3 million provided in FY2010. FY2010 level represented an increase of 6.0% over the FY2009 level of $607.1 million. The House-passed bill would have provided $406.1million. The FY2012 budget contains the following headings: Salaries and expenses. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $413.7million, (not including $6.35 million in authority to spend receipts) The Library had requested nearly $456.0 million (not including $6.35 million in authority to spend receipts), a decrease of $25.7 million (-5.9%) from the $431.8 million provided for FY2011. The House-passed bill would have provided $14.5 million. $117.1 million was requested for the Congressional Research Service. The Senate-reported bill would has provided $16.99 million, a decreases of $834,000 (-4.7%). requested, an increase of $22.2 million (48.5%). The FY2011 level represented a 0.2% reduction from the $45.8 million provided for Library buildings and grounds in FY2010. The Library requested two recurring administrative provisions related to authority to obligate funds for reimbursable and revolving fund activities. The provisions also requested in FY2011 would make available balances of expired Library of Congress appropriations available for the purposes of making payments for employees under Section 8147 of Title 5, United States Code. Librarian of Congress to dispose of surplus or obsolete personal property of the Library of Congress. Amounts received credited to funds available for the operations of the library. The House-passed bill contains the workers compensation provision but not the surplus property provision. The Senate-reported version of the bill contains both of these provisions as well as a provision amending the library's use of revolving funds. The Consolidated Appropriations Act included the four provisions requested by the Library. The bill was passed by the House and the Senate. At a hearing on March 11, 2011, the House subcommittee examined Library operations at various potential funding levels. The Senate subcommittee discussed the impact of funding cuts; the deferral of projects; and requests for additional staff and information technology security funding. GAO works for Congress by responding to requests for studies of federal government programs and expenditures.GAO may be asked to provide information to the Library of Congress on issues relating to its operations. The Library may also provide information about the use of overseas offices. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $511.3 million for FY2011. The House-passed bill ( H.R. 2551 ) would have provided $541.3. The Senate-reported version of H.r. 25 51 would have. provided $504.5 million. Formerly the General Accounting Office, the agency was renamed the Government Accountability Office effective July 7, 2004. The agency also initiate its own work. It was created by a law passed by Congress in 2002. GAO received $531.0 million in the FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act and an additional $25 million in P.L. 111-5 to cover responsibilities under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Act also contained one administrative provision, also included in the House-passed version of H.R. 2551, related to voluntary separation incentive payments. GAO had requested $556.8 million (not including $18.3 million in offsetting collections) for FY2011. House subcommittee discussed GAO's use of field offices; tenant use of excess space inGAO's headquarters; studies related to Member security; and funding for mandates. House-reported bill ( H.R. 2551 ) would have provided $113.0 million, a decrease of $22.1 million (-16.3%). H.Amdt. 704 , offered by Mr. Stutzman and agreed to by recorded vote (218-194), further reduced this funding by $4,946,140.80. The revolving fund supports the operation and maintenance of the Government Printing Office. The House-passed bill did not provide funding for the revolving fund. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $500,000, a decrease of $1.16 million (-69.8%) from the nearly $ 1.66 million provided in FY2011. The congressional printing and binding account pays for expenses of printing andbinding required for congressional use, and for statutorily required printing. The GPO had requested $6.3 million, an increase of $4.6 million. authorized printing, binding, and distribution of government publications for specified recipients at no charge. Included within these publications are the Congressional Record ; Congressional Directory ; Senate and House Journals; memorial addresses of Members; nominations; U.S. Code and supplements. publications printed without a document or report number, for example, laws and treaties. envelopes provided to Members of Congress for the mailing of documents. House and Senate business and committee calendars; bills, resolutions, and amendments. Committee reports and prints; committee hearings; and other documents. of Congress and federal agencies, as statutorily authorized; the compilation of catalogs and indexes of government publications. At a hearing in the House on May 11, 2011, the subcommittee discussed the cost of producing and delivering the Congressional Record; GPO's overhead; security concerns; staffing issues, including the management structure and efforts to reduce discrimination complains. The future of paper in digital age and the operation of GPO was also discussed. The hearing was held in Washington, D.C. of FDsys (the Federal Digital System), which will replace GPO Access. The timing of requested funding for the 2013 presidential inauguration. The Office of Compliance is an independent and nonpartisan agency within the legislative branch. It was established to administer and enforce the Congressional Act of 1974. The Senate subcommittee discussed the changing role of the GPO in the digital age. It also discussed the use of GPO's revolving fund for capital improvements and possible alternatives, and plans for responding to the tight budget environment. Accountability Act applies various employment and workplace safety laws to Congress and certain legislative branch entities. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $3.82 million, the same level as contained in the House-passed version of H.R. 2551. This level represents a decrease of $260,000 (-6.4%) from the $4.08 million provided in P.L. 112-10 for FY2011. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $ 3.87 million. The Open World Leadership Center administers a program that supports democratic changes in other countries. The first program was authorized by Congress in 1999 to support the relationship between Russia and the United States. The center is housed in the Library and receives services from the Library through an inter-agency agreement. In FY2008, Open World received $8.98 million in budget authority, a decrease of 35% from the $13.86 million provided in FY2007 and FY2006. The Senate-reported bill, in contrast, would have provided $10.0 million (-12.1%).

Summary:
GAO: OMB and Treasury have made progress implementing 5 of our recommendations related to DATA Act implementation. Additional effort is needed to address 11 previous GAO recommendations that remain open. Data governance is an institutionalized system of decision rights and accountabilities for planning, overseeing, and controlling data management. A common set of key practices endorsed by standards setting organizations recommend that data governance structures should include the key practices shown in the text box below. The Data Standards Committee held its inaugural meeting on September 15, 2016, and will meet on a monthly basis. OMB is conducting a pilot program, known as the Section 5 Pilot, aimed at developing recommendations for reducing reporting burden for grantees and contractors. Agencies that are developing interim solutions will only have until May 2017 to test the data before the reporting deadline. An OMB document commended these agencies for developing robust contingency plans since this will better position them for timely implementation. Officials said this interim solution is complex and their processes cannot be fully automated until the Oracle patch is released. Since these processes are not fully automated, they carry a risk of errors being introduced though human error. iterative approach enabled agencies and other key stakeholders to provide feedback and contribute to improving the technical guidance and the public website. We are sending copies of this report to the Secretaries of Agriculture, Health and Human Services, and the Treasury; the Director of OMB; the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation of National and Community Service; the Administrator of the General Services Administration; as well as interested congressional committees and other interested parties. This report will be available at no charge on our website at http://www.gao.gov. This review is part of an ongoing effort to provide interim reports on the progress being made in implementing the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of our report. This report examines: (1) steps taken to establish a clear data governance; and (2) the progress made in meeting the reporting requirements for us mandated by the act.

The operationalization of government-wide data standards and the technical specifications for data reporting. updated designs for the Section 5 Pilot for reducing recipient reporting burden and progress made in its implementation. We identify common key practices for establishing effective data governance structures for the DATA Act. We describe the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) efforts to implement a data governance structure for the Data Act. data governance structures. To identify key practices for data governance we reviewed our past reports to identify applicable laws, regulations, and guidance, as well as reports from other entities that could inform our work. We identified organizations that had data governance expertise, had previously published work on data governance, were frequently cited as a primary source, or some combination of these qualifications. In addition, because the DATA Act requires that established data standards incorporate widely accepted common data elements such as those developed in this report, we selected sources that had previously been cited as primary sources. by international voluntary consensus standards bodies, federal agencies with authority over contracting and financial assistance, and accounting standards organizations. All of the organizations we identified endorse establishing and using a governance structure to oversee how data standards, digital content, and other data assets are developed, managed and implemented. Based on these selection factors we drew on work from the following organizations to help us identify data governance key practices across several domains. We selected a range of organizations, including domestic and international standards-setting organizations, industry groups or associations, and federal agencies. governance key practices: American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, American National Standards Institute, Carnegie-Mellon University-Software Engineering Institute, Data Governance Institute. We also met with OMB and Treasury to obtain information on the status of their efforts to address our previous recommendation that they establish a data governance structure. To determine the implementation challenges reported by CFO Act agencies in their DATA Act implementation plan updates, we requested and received the Data Management Association International’s report on the issue. updates from the 24 CFO Act agencies. We reviewed these implementation plan updates and assessed the information against OMB’s requirements and the revised guidance. We determined whether the updates contained the information required by OMB. We also looked at the timeline and milestones with an explanation of the agency's progress to date and the remaining actions it would take to implement the act in accordance with the suggested steps in Playbook 2.0, (2) costs to date, and estimated total future costs. analyzed the agency-reported challenges and mitigating strategies and categorized them. We compared the categories of challenges reported by the CFO Act agencies in their implementation plan updates to the challenges that had been reported in their initial implementation plans in 2015. We interviewed cognizant OMB and Treasury officials and obtained any supporting documentation to further understand the implementation challenges. We also met with O MBM and Treasury to obtain the supporting documentation and processes and controls for reviewing the updated implementation information and monitoring agencies’ progress. information on the status of efforts to address our previous recommendations related to agency implementation plans. To assess efforts to date to operationalize government-wide standards, we reviewed OMB policy guidance intended to facilitate agency reporting. We also interviewed OMB staff and Treasury officials to obtain information about plans for additional guidance as well as to assess the extent to which issued guidance is responsive to agency questions, requests for additional clarity on their reporting requirements, or both. We met with OMB and met with Treasury officials. Treasury to obtain information on the status of efforts to address our previous recommendation related to the provision of policy guidance. To examine the technical structure and specifications for reporting, we assessed Treasury’s processes for developing technical guidance. We reviewed the broker made available by Treasury through open source code posted on a public website (GitHub repositories associated with the DATA Act) In addition, we observed several demonstrations of how agencies submit their data to a prototype of the broker.

We interviewed knowledgeable officials from OMB, Treasury, and selected federal agencies and inspectors general. We also interviewed enterprise resource planning (ERP) vendors assisting federal agencies with technical implementation. Based on these selection, we selected three agencies based on whether they were in compliance with existing federal requirements for federal financial management systems, and the type of federal funding provided (such as grants, loans, or procurements), and their status as a federal shared service provider for financial management. factors, we chose the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) Although the information obtained from these three agencies is not generalizable to all agencies, they illustrate a range of conditions under which agencies are implementing the act. These are the same three agencies we selected for our January 2016 and August 2016 reports. This allowed us to assess progress in DATA Act implementation at these agencies since our last review. We reviewed Section 5 of the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, as amended by the DATA Act. We met with OMB and Treasury to obtain information on the status of efforts to address our recommendation related to providing technical guidance. We reviewed the draft design documents to assess OMB’s plans for meeting these requirements. To supplement our review of those plans, we also spoke with cognizant staff implementing. and DATA Act implementation team members.

To assess the extent to which the Section 5 pilot designs adhered to leading practices for effective pilot design, we reviewed the documented designs. We provided HHS and OMB with feedback on the design of the grants and procurement portions of the pilot. These officials generally accepted our feedback as useful and, in some instances, noted that they have or planned to make changes to their design. We determined that the design met the criteria when we saw evidence that all aspects of a leading practice were met. If we identified a critical gap or shortcoming related to the practice, we determined the criteria were not met. as a result of our input. We also met with OMB to obtain information on the status of efforts to address our recommendation related to the design of the pilot for reducing recipient reporting burden. We conducted the work upon which this report is based from May 2016 to December 2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. In May 2015, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directed federal agencies to submit Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) implementation plans to OMB concurrent with the agencies’ fiscal year 2017 budget requests. In June 2016, OMB directed Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO) to prepare their implementation plans. We reviewed these implementation plans and on July 29, 2016, we issued a report on the results of our review. Act) agencies to submit updates to their initial DATA Act implementation plans by August 12, 2016. The updates were to (1) update timeline and milestones and explain the agency’s progress to date and the remaining actions it would take to implement the act in accordance with the suggested steps in the DATA Act Implementation Playbook (Version 2.0) (Playbook 2.1) The updates also were to report costs to date, estimated total future costs, and explain any new challenges and mitigation strategies. develop their DATA Act implementation plans. Steps 1 through 4 were to be completed by September 2015. As of October 2016, only 16 of the 24 CFO Act agencies reported that they had completed all steps 1 through four. Four agencies had not completed their inventory of data and identified the gaps in systems and processes for data elements (step 3) Data Act Implementation Playbook (Version 1.0) indicated that agencies would be working on steps 5 through 8 throughout fiscal years 2016 and 2017. Playbook 2.0—issued June 24, 2016—includes, among other things, steps 5 and 8. expanded guidance on actions to be included in steps 5 through 8. Playbook 2.0 did not include expected timeframes for agencies to complete each step. Instead, it referred agencies to Treasury’s implementation roadmap, which includes high level milestones for Treasury's technical deliverables. Step 5: Prepare Data for Submission to the Broker. This step involves reviewing the schema version 1.0, extracting data from source systems, mapping agency data to the schema and submitting it to the broker. The broker uses validation rules to test the completeness and accuracy of the data elements and linkages between financial and award data. The broker also tests whether the data passes basic validations within the schema version 1.0. This step involves updating information and systems. If data does not pass validation (see Step 6), the broker will update the data and data systems. Step 7: Update Data. The next step involves implementing system changes as needed to collect and link data. Step 6: Test Broker Outputs and Ensure Data are Valid. provide error details to the agency. The agency should then reference the authoritative data sources and address the discrepancies. Step 8: Submit Data. Once the data is linked, validated, and standardized, agencies are to submit the data to Treasury for posting on USASpending.gov or a successor system. Agency senior accountable officials (SAO) are to provide reasonable assurance that their internal controls support the reliability and validity of the agency account-level and award-level data they submit to Treasury. a minimum, that data reported are based on appropriate internal controls and risk management strategies identified in OMB Circular A-123. Five CFO Act agencies reported challenges in each of the five categories of challenges reported by 19 of the 24 agencies in their implementation plan updates. OMB required agencies to include information on remaining actions the agencies should take to implement suggested steps 5 through 8 in Playbook 2.0, and the number of agencies that included the information in their updates. Five agencies reported problems in each category of challenges. Act agencies did not identify any challenges in their implementation plan updates. Table 5 describes the mitigating strategies reported by 16 of the 24 CFO Act agencies. The number of agencies reporting mitigating strategies in each category is listed in Table 5. The agency contacts included: Peter Del Toro, Michael LaForge, Kathleen Drennan, Diane Morris, Shirley Hwang, Aaron Colsher, Katherine Morris, Sophia Tan, Thomas Hackney, Charles Jones, Laura Pacheco, Maria Belaval. major contributions to this report.

Summary:
President Donald J. Trump announced the nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (Tenth Circuit) to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the 2016 death of Justice Antonin Scalia. This report provides an overview of Judge Gorsuch's jurisprudence and discusses how the High Court might be affected if he were to succeed Justice Scalia. The report analyzes majority, concurring, and dissenting opinions, including decisions that Judge Gorsuch participated in while serving by designation on another federal court of appeals. Justice Blackmun authored the majority opinion in Roe v. Wade recognizing a constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy. He was generally considered one of the more liberal voices on the Court when he retired in 1994. The difficulty in attempting to predict how a nominee will approach the job of being a Justice remains even when the nominee has had a lengthy federal judicial career prior to nomination. He viewed the judge's role as interpreting the law, rather than making new law. He considered himself to be a "strict constructionist" The Supreme Court enjoys "almost complete discretion" in selecting its cases. Unlike the Supreme Court, the federal courts of appeals are required to hear many cases as a matter of law. As a result, the appellate courts consider "many routine cases in which the legal rules are uncontroverted" Perhaps indicative of the nature of federal appellate work, the vast majority of cases decided by three-judge panels of federal courts are decided by federal courts. The Supreme Court is bound by Supreme Court and circuit precedent and is not normally in a position to espouse freely their views. Gorsuch's work on the Tenth Circuit may provide some insight into his general approach to particular legal issues. The bulk of the opinions that Judge Gorsuch has authored or joined may not be particularly insightful with regard to his views on specific areas of law, or how he would approach these issues if he were a Supreme Court Justice. Even in closely contested cases where.of appeals are decided without dissent, the overwhelming majority of opinions issued by that court are unanimous. The Tenth Circuit is no exception to this general trend. concurring or dissenting opinions are filed, it still may be difficult to determine the preferences of the nominated judge. The act of joining an opinion authored by another judge does not necessarily reflect full agreement with the underlying opinion. For example, in an effort to promote consensus on a court, some judges will decline to dissent unless the underlying issue is particularly contentious. As one commentator notes, "[T]he fact that a judge joins in a majority opinion may not be taken as indicating complete agreement. Rather, silent acquiescence" Use caution when interpreting a judge's vote isolated from a written opinion. For example, a vote to grant an extension of time for a party to submit a filing generally does not signal agreement with the substantive legal position proffered by that party. And while some observers have highlighted votes by Judge Gorsuch in favor of the Supreme Court, it may be understood to mean something more like 'I accept the outcome in this case, and I accept that the reasoning in the majority opinion reflects what a majority of my colleagues has agreed on' A vote to rehear a case en banc could signal disagreement with the legal reasoning of the panel decision. A judge wants the entire court to have an opportunity to correct a perceived error by the panel. Most of us vote against most such petitions and suggestions even when we agree with them, as one federal appellate judge noted in a dissent from a decision denying a petition for a rehearingEn banc. The Tenth Circuit is a federal appeals court based in Washington, D.C. It has a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. we think the panel decision is mistaken. We do so because federal courts of appeals decide cases in three judge panels. En banc review is extraordinary, and is generally reserved for conflicting precedent within the circuit. A vote for or against rehearing a case en banc or on other procedural matters does not necessarily equate to an endorsement or repudiation of a particular legal position. Finally, it should be noted that, despite having served on the federal appellate bench for a decade, we think the decision was mistaken. Gorsuch has said little about some areas of law because of the nature of the Tenth Circuit's docket. More than forty percent of the cases that the Tenth circuit hears are criminal law matters or petitions from the federal government. It may be difficult to predict how he might rule on certain issues if he were elevated to the Supreme Court. The Tenth Circuit has a relatively routine caseload when compared to some of its sister circuits. It hears cases from Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. federal or state prisoners, a number in line with the national average for the regional federal courts of appeals. The Tenth Circuit also hears a number of private civil litigation disputes, such as cases on labor, insurance, contract, and tort law. On the other hand, some seven percent of the Tenth Circuit's docket is devoted to administrative agency appeals, a percentage far below that of the D.C. Circuit, where over half the docket consists of administrative matters. Similarly, the Ninth Circuit rarely has the Many commentators have likened the nominee to Justice Scalia. Justice Scalia was a well-known proponent of originalism, textualism, and the view that clear rules should guide the work of the lower courts. In a lecture delivered in April 2016 at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, Judge Gorsuch commended Justice Scalia's approach toward judging. The themes highlighted in his 2016 lecture on Justice Antonin Scalia's legacy previously appeared in several of Judge Gorsuch's opinions on the Tenth Circuit. The nominee rejected the view of the judge as a "pragmatic social-welfare maximizer," arguing for a more limited role for judges. on which he wrote, which, in turn, are assigned by the most senior active judge on each panel. This means that, at least early in Judge Gorsuch's career on the Tenth Circuit, he may not have been assigned to write the most challenging or controversial cases that tend to generate dissent. Perhaps more importantly, because separate opinions are infrequent, the dataset is relatively small, and only a handful of dissents and concurrences distinguish Judge Scalia's numbers from those of his colleagues. judging, the findings in Table 1 and Table 2 may be noteworthy. Professor Michael McConnell of Stanford University described Judge Gorsuch as "unfailingly cordial and collegial" Another former colleague, Robert Henry, now the President of Oklahoma City University, described Judge Neil Gorsuch's "judicial temperament" as "superb" Judge Gorsuch's approach to judging may also differ in substance from that of Justice Scalia. In contrast to the oft quoted "common ground," Judge Gorsuch aims to "find[] common ground" while being "scrupulously respectful" In contrast to Justice Scalia, Judge Gorsuch's writings have generally espoused a more minimalist role for courts. While the nominee has not been immune from criticism that particular majority opinions he wrote swept too broadly. For example, he noted in a 2012 dissent that "[c]aution is always warranted when venturing down the road of judicial overreach" The Supreme Court is expected to vote on the nominee in the next few weeks. For more information, go to CNN.com/soulmatestories. deciding a weighty question of first impression and recognizing a previously unrecognized constitutional right. In a 2009 concurrence, the nominee wrote that "[j]udicial restraint usually means answering the questions we must, not those we can" In a number of opinions the nominee expressly limited the scope of the majority opinions he authored. He has also frequently concurred or dissented to take issue with majority opinions that, in his view, reached issues that were unnecessary to the court's ultimate holding. of law, his opinions at times evidence concern about judges "reshap[ing] the law as they wish it to be" by failing to "attach power to precedent" Of the approximately 180 published majority opinions authored by the nominee, only one has been reviewed in a formal opinion by the Supreme Court, wherein the Court ultimately affirmed the Tenth Circuit decision by a 5-4 vote. Five additional opinions that Judge Gorsuch has authored have not been reviewed by the Court. The Supreme Court has not reviewed any of the five additional opinions. Gorsuch joined have been the subject of a formal opinion by the Supreme Court. Of these five opinions, four were affirmed by the High Court. One opinion that Judge Gorsuch joined, Direct Marketing Ass'n v. Brohl was reversed by the Court in a substantive opinion. As several commentators have noted, Judge Gorsuch can be seen to employ the same general approach to questions of statutory interpretation as President Obama did in his Supreme Court confirmation hearings in 2009. The Supreme Court in recent years has reversed the lower courts in roughly seventy percent of all cases it heard. that Justice Scalia did. This approach—known as textualism —looks to the statutory text, context, and structure when construing laws. Textualism's focus on the wording of the statute is widely shared among contemporary jurists and commentators. But its rejection of extrinsic sources of meaning has been the subject of debate, as have textualist views about judges' proper role in establishing the meaning of statutory text. With Judge Gorsuch in particular, attention to statutory text has often centered upon questions of grammar. nominee once going so far as to diagram part of a sentence in a written opinion. Judge Gorsuch can be seen to resemble Justice Scalia in invoking the "rule of lenity" when construing language that is seen to be ambiguous in favor of criminal defendants. On the other hand, the nominee's recently expressed concerns about " Chevron deference" —judicial deference to the reasonable interpretations by executive branch agencies of ambiguous or silent statutes –distinguish him from Scalia in certain ways. the rule of lenity and Chevron deference—are discussed in more detail later in this report. Consistent with a textualist approach to statutory interpretation, Judge Gorsuch in a number of his written opinions has identified what he views as the "plain text" or "plain language" of the statute in question. The exact words of a statute often formed the starting point for Judge Gorsuch's discussion of questions of interpretation. He has generally accorded such words their customary meaning, as well as their literal meaning. reflected by their dictionary definitions. In his 2015 opinion for a majority of the en banc Tenth Circuit in United States v. Rentz, Judge Gorsuch diagrammed a segment of a sentence in a criminal statute. The specific interpretative question in Rentz was whether multiple charges could be brought against the same person at the same time. In Figure 1 below, the nominee shows how he diagrammed the sentence to help address the underlying interpretativequestion in the Rentz case. For more information, visit the U.S. Supreme Court's website. may be brought under Section 924(c) of Title 18 of the United States Code against a defendant who fired a single shot that hit two separate victims. The total number of charges lodged against a criminal defendant under the statute should never "exceed the number of uses, carries, or possessions" Just as you can't throw more touchdowns during the fourth quarter than the total amount of times you have thrown a touchdown, you cannot use a gun to kill two people at the same time. firearm during and in relation to crimes of violence more than the total number of times you have used a firearm. Previously, in dissenting from the denial of en banc review in United States v. Games-Perez , Judge Gorsuch had expressed similar concerns about reading the mens rea element of a criminal statute. According to Judge Gorsuch, such a reading "defies grammatical gravity and linguistic logic," he said. The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the case in the next few months. characteristic of textualist approaches to statutory interpretation, including resort to the "larger statutory context" The nominee has also invoked a number of canons—or general principles—of statutory interpretation when construing text that is seen to be ambiguous. In so doing, Judge Gorsuch has generally cited to and applied specific interpretative canons. However, in his 2016 opinion for a three-judge court, he cited specific canons without expressly involving himself in the broader debates about the merits. panel of the Tenth Circuit in Lexington Insurance Co. v. Precision Drilling Co., L.P. Judge Gorsuch contrasted canons that he viewed as "finely honed and consistent with the judicial function" with the so called "absurdity canon" This canon is generally said to allow judges to "override even unambiguous statutory texts . . . in order to avoid putatively absurd consequences in their application" Judge Gorsuch expressed concern that broad application of this canon could be dangerous. enable judges to disregard clear statutory text in favor of the jurists' perceived view of Congress's purpose in enacting the statute. Judge Gorsuch's Lexington Insurance opinion can be seen to reflect broader concerns about interpretations of statutory text based on extrinsic evidence of congressional purpose. However, the nominee's discussion of these concerns in Lexington Insurance is arguably notable for its relative length, particularly given that the sole legal authority cited by Judge Gorsuch as supporting purpose-based applications of the absurdity doctrine is an 1892 Supreme Court decision. with the Court in more recent years. The two other judges on the panel would not have reached the questions regarding the absurdity doctrine, concluding instead that the plaintiff had waived the argument. Unlike Justice Scalia, who generally viewed the use of legislative history materials as illegitimate even in support of text-based arguments, Judge Gorsuch has cited them in certain cases. The nominee has expressed concerns, akin to those voiced by Justice Scalia,. about invocations of alleged congressional or statutory purposes that are untethered from or contrary to the express statutory text. of dozens or even hundreds of members. Other concerns appear to be grounded in the nominee's views about the respective roles of the judicial and legislative branches. Much like Justice Scalia, Judge Gorsuch has opined that courts should interpret the law, not create it. As a result, if Judge Gorsuch were to serve on the Supreme Court, his views on the role of the judiciary would likely be more restrictive than those of Justice Scalia or any other justice in the history of the U.S. Supreme Court. Administrative law cases at the Supreme Court are often contentious, resulting in divided decisions on legal issues of national import. The Tenth Circuit's docket does not include as many administrative law cases as other federal courts. In the few cases that have come before the court, the justices have been split 4-4 in favor of the government. On statutory interpretation, the views of the justice he would replace would largely appear to align with those of the Justice he'd replace. On the issue of the scope of an agency's discretion to issue guidance documents to set regulatory policy, the Justice would likely side with the agency in this case. him, Judge Gorsuch has articulated distinct views that may signal how he would approach administrative law matters if he were elevated to the Supreme Court. A central threshold issue in administrative law cases is whether a challenged agency action is suitable for judicial review in the first place, including whether a court has jurisdiction over the case. While this inquiry is often dependent on the facts of a given case, a few trends can arguably be discerned from the various cases raising justiciability issues in which Judge Gorsuch presided. challenge to a federal agency policy and outside of that context, the nominee sided with the majority of the appellate panel in most cases where access to judicial relief was litigated. In the few judicial access cases in which Judge Gorsuch wrote a separate opinion, he has tended to do so on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction over the suit. For example, in Wilderness Society v. Kane County , a majority in the en banc panel held that the plaintiffs lacked jurisdiction in the case. He has not demonstrated a proclivity towards a notably expansive or restrictive view of jurisdictional issues. prudential standing in a challenge brought against a local government entity under the Supremacy Clause. In Kerr v. Hickenlooper, a suit brought by state legislators claiming that a voter initiative violated the Constitution's Guarantee Clause, the original three-judge panel rejected arguments that the court lacked jurisdiction over the case. Judge Gorsuch dissented from a subsequent denial of rehearing en banc, arguing that the case presented a nonjusticiable political question. He concluded that the Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction in the first place. Under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), a reviewing court must set aside agency action that is "not in accordance with law" Pursuant to the framework established by the Supreme Court in Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., a court will generally defer to an agency's interpretation of a statute that is seen to be silent or ambiguous on a particular issue. In National Cable & Telecommunications Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Services , the Supreme. Court ruled in favor of the cable company. Court interpreted Chevro n to extend to an agency's interpretation of a silent or ambiguous statute even if a court had previously interpreted the statute in question. As a statistical matter, under the Chevron doctrine, courts have often deferred to an agencies interpretation of its own statutory authority. In engaging in substantive review of agency actions, Judge Gorsuch has questioned the size and power of the modern administrative state. He has declared that the number of regulations issued by agencies has "grown so exuberantly it's hard to keep up" Gorsuch has taken a narrow view of the situations in which Chevron deference is due. The nominee has also raised "questions like whether and how people can be fairly expected to keep pace with and conform their conduct to all this churning and changing 'law" In perhaps the most discussed of Judge Gorsuch's opinions, Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch, he wrote for a unanimous majority. The Supreme Court will vote on whether to confirm the nominee to the high court. panel that declined to defer to an agency's determination under Chevron and Brand X. The nominee wrote a separate concurring opinion calling into the question the wisdom and constitutionality of the doctrines created by both cases. Emphasizing the concept of separated powers envisioned by the Founders, Judge Gorsuch distinguished between the elected legislature's task of setting policy prospectively and the judiciary's duty of neutrally interpreting the law in retroactively adjudicating disputes. For Judge Gorsuch, this assignment of responsibilities ensures liberty by protecting parties who cannot alter their past conduct to the changes in majoritarian politics and bars. Frida Ghitis: Supreme Court nominee's views on Chevron deference differ from those of Justice Scalia. She says if he were to succeed Scalia, he might favor a narrowing of the scope of the deference doctrine. Ghitis says his views may be consistent with Justice Scalia's opposition to the Brand X-of-powers doctrine on the separation of powers grounds, on the other hand, may be in line with his view on other issues. She asks: Does he favor eliminating the doctrine, or at least cabining its application? was unclear, Judge Gorsuch appears to have cabined the circumstance in which these doctrines apply. In De Niz Robles , a precursor to the Tenth Circuit's opinion in Gutierrez-Brizuela , Judge Gorsuch, writing for a unanimous panel, rejected the retroactive application of an agency's adjudication that upset the affected party's reliance interests. In other words, at least in the Tenth circuit, De Nize Robles did not read Brand X to apply when an agency seeks to apply its interpretation retroactively. Gorsuch grounded his decision in principles of separation of powers, due process, and equal protection. He noted the presumptive prospective effect of legislation compared with the retroactive effect of a judicial decision. The more an agency's decision resembles that of a judge, the stronger the case for retroactive application of the decision. But the more the decision resembles legislation, the less likely such a decision should be granted retroactive force, he said. Given this guidepost, De Niz Robles concluded. that when an agency issues an interpretation of an ambiguous statutory provision under Chevron via an adjudication that displaces a contrary judicial decision, it is operating like legislators setting new policies. Per the 2015 ruling, such decisions should presumptively apply only prospectively. Beyond Judge Gorsuch's two major rulings in Gutierrez-Brizuela and De Niz Robles , he has tended to be more skeptical of deferring to agencies on legal questions. For example, in TransAm Trucking, Inc. v. Department of Labor , the panel majority upheld a determination by the Department ofLabor that a truck driver was terminated in violation of the law. of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act. At issue was whether the truck driver engaged in protected activity under the Act by "refus[ing] to operate a vehicle" due to safety concerns. The court deferred under Chevron to the Department's determination that the driver's decision to drive his truck away from his trailer in freezing conditions qualified as protected activity. Judge Gorsuch wrote a dissenting opinion, arguing that the statute's meaning was plain and that he rejected extending Chevron deference to the agency's interpretation. that, in contrast to the majority's reasoning, the absence of a statutory definition did not create ambiguity. Instead, Judge Gorsuch thought the statute was clear and unambiguous, and therefore would have ruled against the agency's interpretation at Chevron 's first step. Discretionary and Factual Review. In contrast to his views on the doctrine of judicial deference to agency statutory interpretations, Judge. Gorsuch does not appear to have expressed strong objections to the mechanics of discretionary or factual review, a second major area of substantive administrative law. to be arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion." The nominee has joined or written several unanimous decisions upholding agency actions. However, the nominee has sometimes departed from his colleagues and written separately to find agency actions arbitrary and capricous. The majority panel upheld the Board's decision to "exclude interim earnings from backpay calculations when the employer has wrongfully reduced employee wages" in National Labor Relations Board v. Community Health Services. The nominee doubted that the parties received fair notice of applicable rules and regulations. The agency had considerable discretion under the National Labor Relations Act to determine how back pay should be calculated. Judge Gorsuch dissented, claiming that the agency's decision failed to explain why it treated similarly situated entities differently. His opinion faulted the agency for essentially announcing a new rule without justification, and arbitrarily distinguishing between situations where terminated employees worked reduced hours, but not terminated employment. The majority noted that while the decision was inconsistent with prior determinations, the agency had plenty of discretion to make the decision. Supreme Court nominee could be influential on future of the death penalty, says Julian Zelizer. If confirmed, he would replace Justice Scalia, who believed death penalty was consistent with the Eighth Amendment, he says. Zelizer: While the nominee is not wholly opposed to scrutinizing a state's imposition, he generally accords a large degree of deference to decisions by state legislators, judges, and executive branch officials on matters relating to the states' imposition and administration of capital punishment. He says the nominee's votes in support of two Tenth Circuit opinions rejecting similar challenges to the method in which a state carried out executions suggests he might provide a fifth vote. jurors because of their alleged bias in favor of capital punishment. All three judges on the panel agreed that the prisoner's convictions should be affirmed. However, Judge Gorsuch disagreed on the question of whether the state court of appeals had neglected to apply controlling Supreme Court precedent properly in assessing the petitioner's claim of juror bias during sentencing. He argued that the court should defer to the state appeals court's statements in its opinion, which indicated that the juror's bias was not severe enough. The Tenth Circuit owed "double deference" to the state criminal appeals court's decision that the state trial court did not improperly fail to exclude the jurors from sentencing proceedings. Judge Gorsuch's concurrence in one capital case in which the majority denied the petition for habeas relief indicates that there are some circumstances in which he may question the state's imposition of the death penalty. In Williams v. Williams, the Tenth Circuit ruled that the.state trial court had applied the correct standard for jury exclusion. Trammel , Judge Gorsuch agreed that the court should deny the petitioner's claim for relief. But he expressed concerns with the state court's apparent willingness to impose capital punishment on an accomplice. The judge wrote that the Eighth Amendment phrase "cruel and unusual punishment" would likely bar such a concept of punishment. He wrote that such a punishment would likely be illegal under the First Amendment's Eighth Amendment clause, which protects the right to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence in a criminal case. accessory liability. He appears willing to scrutinize state court decisions that appear to contravene existing constitutional protections for capital defendants if those protections are clearly articulated in Supreme Court decisions. But he may be reluctant to engage in a broad reading of the Constitution and Supreme Court precedent that would expand the rights of such defendants beyond existing precedent. He has generally demonstrated a propensity to defer to the decisions of state legislators, judges, and executive branch officials in matters relating to capital punishment. He could be influential, were he to be confirmed to the Supreme Court. elevated to the Supreme Court, involves the procedural and substantive limits that federal law imposes on the exposure of defendants to monetary liability in civil cases. This is because Justice Scalia, whom Judge Gorsuch could succeed on the Court, cast critical votes in several closely contested cases that read federal law relatively expansively to restrict the ability of plaintiffs to use class action litigation to facilitate civil recoveries. The case involves lawsuits resulting from allegedly faulty products, discriminatory practices, or fraudulent activities. The judge could succeed if he is confirmed. sue businesses that may have harmed them. In other cases, Justice Scalia cast important votes in cases that more narrowly interpreted the scope of federal law to limit corporate defendants' potential civil liability. Given Justice Scalia's decisions, commentators have considered how Judge Gorsuch might affect the Roberts Court's perceived "warmth" toward businesses on civil liability matters if the nominee were to be confirmed. Pointing to his writings that are critical of the use of class action lawsuits in securities fraud cases, his apparent preference for arbitration over litigation. some commentators suggest that Judge Gorsuch would limit the exposure of civil defendants. Through his judicial and nonjudicial writings, Judge Gorsuch has expressed an interest in issues related to civil liability. This interest is evident in several pointed critiques that he has authored on what he perceives as the misuses or excesses of litigation. In addition, when asked to identify "the 10 most significant cases over which you have an opinion," Judge Gorsuch said he would like to see the case settled in a civil trial. presided" on the Senate Judiciary Committee's "Questionnaire for Nominee to the Supreme Court" Two of the ten cases Judge Gorsuch selected were opinions that affirmed the dismissal of civil claims by the district court. In Cook v. Rockwell Int ernationa l Corp. , for example, the nominee lamented: It took a titanic fifteen years for the case to go to trial. The nominee lamented that the case took 15 years to get to the court because of the nature of the case. case to reach a jury. No doubt a testament to contemporary civil litigation practices that ensure before any trial is held every stone will be overturned in discovery. Somehow, though, this case managed to survive the usually lethal gauntlet of pretrial proceedings and stagger its way to trial. From this sentiment, it might be surmised that Judge Gorsuch may be particularly receptive to curtailing the costly litigation process through strict readings of statutes that create private rights of private property. The case is still pending. In Hammond v. Stamps.com, Inc. , for example, the plaintiff filed a putative class action in state court alleging unlawful trade practices involving allegedly misleading website disclosures. The district court refused to exercise jurisdiction because it found the defendant failed to meet its burden of showing that over $5 million was "in controversy," as required by the statute. On appeal, Judge Gorsuch authored a unanimous opinion reversing the district court based on a detailed construction of the statutory term " in controversy" He found "federal jurisdiction here beyond doubt," thereby allowing the class action to proceed. no actual agreement to arbitrate as there was no meeting of the minds as to how claims that implicated the numerous agreements would be arbitrated. Judge Gorsuch dissented, stating "I just don't see any doubt that the parties before us did intend to arbitrated" In doing so, he noted "the federal policy favoring arbitration embodied in the FAA," and that "[t]he Supreme Court has held that the FAA preempts state laws that single out arbitration clauses for disfavored treatment" Like arbitration, preemption is the circumstance in which federal law supersedes state law. displaces state causes of action, such as tort claims. In determining whether federal law preempts common law tort claims, the nominee's approach is centrally grounded in the words of the federal statute at issue. In Cook v. Rockwell Int ernationa l Corp. , for instance, property owners filed a class action against the company. The judge's approach has resulted in judgments both in favor of and against civil defendants, as well as against the defendants in the case in question. under the federal Price-Anderson Act and state tort law against operators of a nuclear weapons manufacturing plant to recover for damages caused by releases of plutonium and other hazardous substances. After the federal claims failed, the district court disallowed the case to proceed on the state law claims, holding that they were preempted by federal law. Judge Gorsuch disagreed, saying: "Where does any of this language—expressly—preempt and preclude all state law tort recoveries for plaintiffs who plead but do not prove nuclear incidents? We just don't see it" Judge Gorsuch also looked to the "larger statutory structure" and the statute's legislative history to buttress his conclusion. Caplinger v. Medtronic, Inc. affirmed the district court's dismissal of the complaint as preempted by federal law based on a reading of an express preemption clause within the Medical Device Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Medical Devices Act of 1998. The case involved a lawsuit alleging the defendant had promoted an "off label" use of a medical device that resulted in the plaintiff's injuries. Cosmetics Act (FDCA). This provision, however, has a complex history of statutory interpretation by the Supreme Court. Judge Gorsuch noted that one such case articulated the following test for preemption, stating: "[T]ort suits do not impose new 'requirements' on manufacturers and are not preempted so long as the duties they seek to impose 'parallel' duties found in the FDCA" But, Judge Gorsuch stated, "the Court's answer only invited the next question: when exactly does a state law duty 'par parallel' a federal law duty enough to evade preemption?" to judicial exposition." Furthermore, he observed, "the Supreme Court has twice revisited and cut back the scope of its initial decision." Left to reconcile competing statutory interpretations by the High Court, Judge Gorsuch asked: "How are we supposed to apply all these competing instructions? It's no easy task" Ultimately, the court held that the state law claims were preempted because the plaintiff failed to identify a parallel federal requirement based on off-label promotion of a medical device. The nominee applied these principles while referring back to the statute's plain text throughout his analysis. Law in which Judge Gorsuch could be influential if he were to be elevated to the Supreme Court. Justice Scalia's views regarding the scope of constitutional and statutory civil rights protections were established in a number of judicial opinions. However, unlike Justice Scalia, Judge Gorsuch's views on constitutional civil rights questions are less well known because he has had relatively few occasions to address such questions directly in cases before the Tenth Circuit. He has not, for example, had occasion to address affirmative action and issues related to sexual orientation. write on the constitutional limits on affirmative action or the equal protection rights of sexual minorities. Most of the civil rights decisions in which the nominee has participated have centered upon statutory civil rights claims. The nominee's opinions in these cases to date have resulted in a variety of outcomes, some favorable to individual plaintiffs, some unfavorable. Based on these decisions, an argument could be made that Judge Gorsuch's views on statutory civil Rights reflect his textualist approach to construing statutes, instead of a more results-driven judicial philosophy. Gorsuch has authored or otherwise participated in relatively few opinions addressing claims that a government enactment, policy, or practice has deprived persons of equal protection of the law. There is one opinion, Secsys LLC v. Vigil, authored by Judge Gorsuch for a unanimous panel of the Tenth Circuit. This opinion characterizes equal protection as "the law's keystone"; explores the differences between intentional and unintentional discrimination. The opinion was published in the online edition of The Federalist, published by Simon & Schuster.  Secsys is unusual in that the plaintiff corporation alleged that state officials had deprived it of equal protection by requiring it to award a subcontract under a state contract to a specific individual. Judge Gorsuch rejected this claim, in part, on the grounds that the state officials would have required a similar subcontracting agreement from any other contractor, making Secsys' claim moot. The ruling also explains what types of government action may be subject to heightened scrutiny, and explains what type of government actions may be under heightened scrutiny. their actions distinguishable from "a rule saying that African Americans or women may not bid for a state contract or that only those of a certain religious faith may" The nominee also described the plaintiffs as asking the court to endorse a "novel theory" of equal protection in this case to reach issues that were more commonly covered by criminal or civil laws against extortion. This language could suggest that Judge Gorsuch believes that the Constitution's equal protection principles play a crucial role in prohibiting certain government discrimination based on religion. on race or sex, but may be more skeptical of interpreting the Equal Protection Clause expansively to shield against previously unrecognized forms of discrimination. Judge Gorsuch also joined the unanimous decision by a panel of the Tenth Circuit in 2015 in Druley v. Patton. In 2009, in 2009, Judge Gorsuch joined a unanimous decision  in a case involving a transgendered prisoner in an all-male facility. In that case, the court ruled that the prisoner was not entitled to wear female undergarments because she was housed in a male facility. the Ninth Circuit—where he was sitting by designation—in Kastl v. Maricopa County Community College District. In both cases, unanimous panels purported to rely on direct precedent in reaching their conclusions. For example, in Druley , the panel noted Tenth Circuit precedent holding that transsexuals are not members of a class for which heightened heightened protection is required. In Druley, the court held that a transsexual instructor whose contract was not renewed after she had been banned from using the women's restroom "until she could prove completion of sex reassignment surgery" scrutiny is required under the Equal Protection Clause. Because of this, in the panel's view, the state officials' decisions were subject to the less stringent "rational basis review," which the decisions were able to withstand. Similarly, in Kastl , the panel noted, in a short three-page order, that the plaintiff had failed to "put forward sufficient evidence demonstrating that [the school's actions were] motivated by her gender" This, in their view, caused her claims to fail. more federal civil rights statutes. Such statutes include Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), as amended. It appears that his jurisprudence is largely a product of his preferences for textualism and rules based adjudication, as opposed to a preference to rule for a particular side. However, it should be noted that some commentators have criticized certain rulings by Judge Neil Neil Gorsuch in the Supreme Court case "Gorsuch v. United States" The case is expected to be heard in the fall. Judge Gorsuch in this area, taking note of the outcomes in specific cases on the grounds that the discrimination claims of particular victims were "thrown . . . out of court" in favor of a corporate or government entity. While Judge Gorsuch has authored or joined some rulings that were unfavorable to such individuals, this fact may be of limited utility in ascertaining Judge Gorsuch's views about the scope of statutory civil rights protections. Many of the plaintiffs raising federal antidiscrimination claims, especially in the context of employment disputes, rarely prevail before the federal appellate courts. the decisions on statutory civil rights in which the nominee participated involved unanimous rulings to dismiss a particular case. In 2009 in Strickland v. United Parcel Service, Inc. , Judge Gorsuch agreed with two colleagues that the plaintiff should be able to proceed to trial on a FMLA retaliation claim, but differed from his colleagues as to the plaintiff's Title VII claim. In addition, litigation involving statutory civil civil rights claims often turns on the facts of a specific case, as opposed to differences in opinions about the law. case based on the factual record before the court. While the other two judges voted to reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment to the defendant on the Title VII claim, Judge Gorsuch would have affirmed the lower court's decision. In particular, he construed two key depositions relied on by the plaintiff as simply showing that the plaintiff's supervisor "harassed male employees in very much the same manner he harassed Ms. Strickland" In another fact-intensive civil rights case resulting in a different outcome—a ruling for the plaintiffs— Orr v. Orr. City of Albuquerque , Judge Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion. This opinion, much like Strickland , engaged in a "thorough review of the record" And Orr is not the only case in which Judge Gorsuch has ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in a statutory civil rights case. It could suggest that the ultimate outcomes of particular cases are driven by Judge Gorsuch's general judicial philosophy as well as his rulings in Orr and other similar cases. It is not clear whether the Supreme Court will take up the case. The substance of several of the nominee's opinions on federal antidiscrimination law is, at times, telling. The nominee's general views on adjudication may suggest that his approach will shape his approach to the law. For instance, in keeping with his preference for clear rules and his general critique of "needless" complexities in the law, Judge Gorsuch has written multiple opinions questioning the efficacy of a central—but complicated—doctrine. The judge is opposed to a general preference to reach a business or government friendly outcome. Under the McDonnell Douglas test, a plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination, and then the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment action. If the employer meets this burden, the plaintiff can still prevail by offering evidence demonstrating that the employer's explanation is pretextual. In Paup v. Gear Products, Inc. , Judge Gorsuch joined a per curiam opinion that, while acknowledging McDonnell Douglas was "binding on us" in the case at hand, noted criticism that its multipart, burden shifting test is unfair. Gorsuch's most pointed critique of McDonnell Douglas came in a 2016 First Amendment retaliation case, Walton v. Powell. Rejecting the defendant's argument that the test should be applied in a free association case, the nominee noted that the "special and idiosyncratic" McDonnell Douglas test is not "helpful enough to justify the costs and burdens associated with its administration" In Barrett v. Salt Lake County , the nominee highlighted criticism by two colleagues that the Test is "not helpful enough" to justify its administration. Douglas test "has proven of limited value even in its native waters," with the Tenth Circuit finding it inapplicable outside of motions for summary judgment in cases relying on circumstantial evidence. While it is unclear whether the elimination of the McDonnell Douglas test would necessarily favor a particular side in employment litigation, legal commentators have noted that because the test is "bedrock employment law doctrine" any limits Judge Gorsuch might impose on the use of this test could cause a "significant change in how employment discrimination lawsuits are prosecuted and prosecuted" In Almond v. Unified School District #501, the nominee employed a textualist approach in one of the first opinions interpreting the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009. Rejecting the view that the phrase "discrimination in compensation" was used in the Act as "some Rorschach inkblot," he concluded that the Act's expanded accrual period for "discrimination" claims applied only to "unequal pay for equal work" claims, not to all claims of discriminatory compensation. to which we may ascribe whatever meaning springs to mind," Judge Gorsuch wrote. He looked to the "language of the Act itself," the Act's structure, and key canons of statutory construction. In another decision, he said a student who had previously settled a lawsuit involving alleged violations of the IDEA was barred from "seeking the same relief" under the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and 42 U.S.C. He wrote for the majority in holding that the student was not entitled to same relief. The nominee relied primarily on the "plain text" of the statute. The majority construed that plaintiffs attempting to bring civil actions under other federal laws "seeking the same relief IDEA supplies" must exhaust certain procedures set forth in the IDEA "'to the same extent' as you must to bring a civil action under IDEA itself" The dissenting judge argued that the majority had "misread" the statute in question by viewing Section 1415( l ) of Title 20 of the United States Code as unambiguously imposing certain requirements. also objected that the outcome under the majority's reading ran contrary to Congress's intent by "harm[ing] the interests of the children that IDEA was intended to protect" However, in perhaps a reflection on how his broader views on the role of the judge influence his civil rights jurisprudence, Judge Gorsuch's opinion took a different view of this argument. He opined that the court would be substituting its view of desirable social policy for that of Congress if it were to adopt the plaintiff's proposed interpretation. Judge Neil Gorsuch has helped shape jurisprudence in ways that could be seen to favor criminal defendants. He has written on issues such as the scope of the Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. His views on the Confrontation Clause and scope of self-incrimination rights under the Fifth Amendment are less clear because he has not written on them to a significant extent, writes Julian Zelizer. Zelizer: On the whole, though, his opinions are seemingly shaped by his views on how legal texts are to be construed. that the deputies were not entitled to qualified immunity because the law at the time of the incident clearly established that the conduct alleged was constitutionally excessive. In reaching this conclusion, the nominee proceeded through an analysis of each of the Graham factors. Similarly, but resulting in a contrary outcome, Judge Gorsuch authored the majority opinion in Wilson v. City of Lafayette , finding qualified immunity protected an officer who used a taser on an individual fleeing arrest, resulting in the suspect's death. In doing so, the nominees recited and analyzed each of those factors. Gorsuch: "No one questions that the use of a taser, especially if one probe hits the head, amounts to a significant physical intrusion requiring a correspondingly significant justification" The nominee found the "physical intrusion" in Wilson was not clearly established to be excessive in light of the other Graham factors, including the arrestee actively resisting arrest. In Fisher v. City of Las Cruces, the majority found that a material factual dispute existed as to whether the plaintiff's injuries, which the plaintiff claimed, were excessive. he sustained while being handcuffed after he had shot himself, were sufficient for an excessive force claim. Judge Gorsuch concurred with the majority's use of the Graham factors and its conclusion that the factors suggested the officers may not have acted reasonably. But he faulted the majority for "tak[ing] a detour, asking whether, in addition to satisfying all three Graham factors, Mr. Fisher has also shown that he suffered a 'non- de minimis injury'" Such an inquiry had previously been found to be required only in. cases involving allegations of overly tight handcuffing, and the nominee felt that it was an inappropriate departure from Graham in this case. On another matter of constitutional criminal procedure that has, at times, divided the Supreme Court in recent years, Judge Gorsuch wrote a notable dissent in United States v. Nicholson. The issue in Nicholson was whether a police officer, who mistakenly thought the defendant had violated a local traffic ordinance, could seize evidence from the defendant's car during the resulting stop. Noting a New Mexico court ruling that had concluded that. the ordinance relied on by the police officer did not provide a legal basis for the stop. The majority decision held that a failure to understand the law by the "very person charged with enforcing it" was objectively unreasonable and warranted suppression of the evidence seized. Judge Gorsuch in dissent rejected the view that an officer's mistake of law " always violates the Fourth Amendment" Instead, he argued that, when the law at issue is "deeply ambiguous," the law should be treated as a reasonableness inquiry. and the officer's interpretation [is] entirely reasonable," a totality of the circumstances test should counsel for not suppressing evidence seized because of a mistake of law. A year and a half after the Tenth Circuit's opinion in Nicholson , the Supreme Court effectively sided with Judge Gorsuch's more flexible view of the exclusionary rule. While the approach taken by Judge Gorsuch in his dissent in Nicholson eventually found favor at the Supreme court, the approach he took in this case was not as clear-cut as it could have been. The nominee's dissent in a case on another often litigated issue in constitutional criminal law did not ultimately become the prevailing view at the High Court. In Williams v. Jones , Judge Gorsuch served on a panel reviewing the ineffective assistance claim of a criminal defendant. Three years after Williams , the Supreme Court, in a pair of 5-4 decisions for which Justice Scalia wrote dissenting opinions, held that the Sixth Amendment right to adequate assistance of counsel extends to the negotiation and consideration of plea bargains. At issue was language in the Mandatory Victims Restoration Act stating that the "court shall set a date for the final determination of the victim's losses, not to exceed 90 days after sentencing" The defendant argued that the language was jurisdictional, which would have meant that the court lacked the authority to enter any restitution order after the 90 days had passed. A unanimous panel of the Tenth Circuit in United States v. Dolan ruled in favor of the defendant in the case. The case was decided on a unanimous vote. Gorsuch wrote that the 90-day rule was a claims processing rule intended to promote speed and unconnected to the court's authority. In so doing, the nominee noted various factors, including the "statute's language and structure," as well as an interpretative canon calling for courts to construe statutes as "directory," rather than jurisdictional. Although Dolan was written relatively early in Judge Gorsuch's tenure, it was written early in the judge's tenure as a federal judge. The Supreme Court granted certiorari in the case. A majority of the High Court voted to affirm the Tenth Circuit's decision in Dolan. Justice Scalia joined a dissenting opinion authored by Chief Justice Roberts that viewed the "clear statutory text" to preclude the court from granting restitution more than 90 days after sentencing. It could suggest certain differences between his textualist approach and that of Justice Scalia, writes Julian Zelizer. "This difference between the Tenth Court's textualist interpretation ... seems to have been shaped primarily by the different emphases that Justice Scalia had," Zelizer says. the Tenth Circuit and the Chief Justice gave to different words in the statute. The Tenth Circuit focused on the "notwithstanding" clause, viewing it as mandating restitution in every case. The dissenters on the High Court, in contrast, relied, at least in part, on the phrase "n notwithstanding any other provision of law," which they say requires restitution even if it is not made at sentencing or within 90 days thereof. The Supreme Court's ruling is expected to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. part, on the phrase "when sentencing," which they would have construed to mean that a district court has no power to act after sentencing. On the question of the mens rea—or mental state—requirements of criminal statutes, Judge Gorsuch's textualist approach is sometimes said to have led to "defendant-friendly" results. He dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc in United States v. Games-Perez. This case centered on whether federal statutes penalizing the possession of firearms by felons require a mental state. the government to prove that a defendant knew of both his own status as a felon and his possession of a firearm, or whether the government needs to prove only that the defendant knowingly possessed a firearm. In his dissent in Games-Perez , Judge Gorsuch opined that reading the mens rea element of a criminal statute as "leapfrogging over the first statutorily specified element and touching down only at the second listed element " "defies grammatical gravity and linguistic logic," among other things. In United States v. Manatau, Judge Gorsuch relied on the plain language of sentencing guidelines to reach a more lenient interpretation of the mens rea requirement. The government had argued that the court should construe the term "intended loss" as used in connection with a sentencing enhancement for bank fraud and aggravated identity theft. However, the court disagreed, finding that the "plain" language of the sentencing guidelines was more appropriate.things. to do in the U.S. language" of the guideline was such that "intended" must be construed to refer to a loss "done on purpose" The court also noted the longstanding tradition in American criminal law of restricting liability to "cases where an intentional choice to do wrong is present" A more stringent approach to mens rea requirements, in which intention or knowledge of wrongdoing is generally construed to be part of the crime, is often associated with concerns about overcriminalization. Judge Gorsuch has criticized in much the same way Justice Scalia did. that could also be seen to be "defendant-friendly"—and to resemble Justice Scalia's approach. In its standard formulation, the rule of lenity "insists that courts side with the defendant 'when the ordinary canons of statutory construction have revealed no satisfactory construction'" Much as Justice Scalia did, Judge Gorsuch has invoked the rule in several criminal cases, including his 2015 opinion for a majority of the en banc Tenth Circuit in United States v. Rentz . Here, Judge Scalia invoked theRule oflenity. in support of a primarily text based interpretation, asserting that "[t]o the extent any ambiguity remains, we don't default to the most severe possible interpretation of the statute" The nominee opined that invoking the rule when construing ambiguous criminal statutes helps to ensure that individuals have "fair warning" when lawmakers want to impose criminal consequences to certain conduct. He also noted that the rule promotes separation-of-powers principles by ensuring that the legislature, and the public, have fair warning. not the prosecution, "decide[s] the circumstances when people may be sent to prison," he said. Previously, in his 2014 opinion for the panel majority in United States v. Smith, Judge Gorsuch had similarly cited a separation-of-powers rationale for the rule of lenity. With the Supreme Court often closely divided on various aspects of environmental law in recent years, Judge Neil Gorsuch could serve as a critical vote on such matters if confirmed to the Court. "It is not the job of independent courts to bend ambiguous statutory subsections in procrustean ways to fit the prosecutor's bill" The nominee has authored few opinions involving environmental law issues. The lack of a robust record for Judge Gorsuch on environmental law matters may not be surprising. The Tenth Circuit does not hear many environmental law cases because many major environmental statutes require parties challenging nationally applicable federal laws or administrative agency actions to file a petition in the D.C. Circuit. The territorial jurisdiction of the Tenth Circuit, however, does cover six western states and parts of Yellowstone National Park, which collectively contain millions of people. It does not have the same jurisdiction as the Supreme Court. Gorsuch has authored or joined opinions in several cases challenging federal agency actions related to the management of federal public lands and natural resources. This constitutes the bulk of the nominee's environmental law record. The outcome of an environmental case often depends on the court's resolution of threshold procedural issues, such as whether a plaintiff has the right to bring a lawsuit in the first place or to join an ongoing lawsuit. If such lawsuits are filed, to proceed, to be heard by the Supreme Court in the fall. to the merits, a plaintiff will need to establish standing, a procedural threshold that has, at times, impeded environmental litigation. While Judge Gorsuch has authored or joined opinions in a few cases, there is no discernible trend in his environmental standing jurisprudence. For example, his opinion for the majority in Backcountry Hunters & Anglers v. U.S. Forest Service provides one example of a case that was dismissed because the plaintiffs lacked standing. In this case, the plaintiffs challenged a temporary U.S. Forest Service order that allowed motorcycles—but prohibited all-terrain vehicles (ATVs)—on certain forest trails. Judge Gorsuch, writing for a unanimous court, determined that the appellants lacked a genuine stake in the outcome of the proceedings. In dismissing the case, the nominee wrote that a victory for the appellant "would seem to do nothing to help—and perhaps much to hurt—[their] cause," which was to reduce vehicles on forest trail. joined a majority opinion determining that an environmental group had standing to challenge the Bureau of Land Management's interpretation of its own prior order that allowed a coal mining project to go forward in Utah's Lila Canyon. The majority opinion concluded that the environmental group would suffer injury from the company beginning mining operations by impairing "the ability of its members to continue enjoyment of the aesthetic and scientific benefits provided by the land in question" Judge Gorsuch has also authored or joined other majority opinions in a number of other cases touching upon environmental issues. court determined that an environmental group or regulated business had standing to sue. The limited number of cases on standing in the environmental context makes it difficult to discern any broad tendencies of Judge Gorsuch on the subject. In 2013, he dissented from a majority opinion holding that environmental groups were entitled to intervene as of right. He wrote that "Judges owe the same obligation of fidelity to the record and the law in all cases and to all persons appearing before them—regardless of who the litigant is" In a lawsuit challenging a Forest Service plan that allowed for limited off-highway vehicle use in New Mexico's Santa Fe National Forest, Judge Neil Gorsuch dissented. He argued that the environmental groups lacked a right to intervene in the case because their interests were already adequately represented by the government. But his dissent implied that he might have voted in favor of the groups joining the litigation if the government had abandoned its efforts to enforce the law at issue. If his views on Chevron deference were to prevail, there is some debate on what impact this would have for environmental law. Tribunal: If confirmed, Neil Gorsuch could challenge use of dormant Commerce Clause to strike down state environmental laws. He says it's unclear to what degree his conclusions reflect his own approach to federalism questions. Tribe: In general, however, in cases implicating federalism concerns, he has exhibited respect for state court decisions, interpretations, and rules. It's unclear how much of a role federalism will play in his decision-making, Tribe says, but he has expressed clear views in support of abstention. Judges have claimed the authority to strike down state laws that unduly interfere with interstate commerce. In Epel , Judge Gorsuch ultimately upheld a state law that required electricity generators to ensure that twenty percent of electricity sold to state consumers came from renewable resources. This conclusion was based on a strict reading of one line of dormant Commerce Clause cases, writes Julian Zelizer. Zelizer: Judge Gorsuch's opinion suggests a skeptical reading of the dormant Commerce clause and an interest in cabining the doctrine to the facts of previous cases. Claims the (anything but dormant) power to strike down some state laws even in the absence of congressional direction. limited number of cases in which the nominee has ruled on other aspects of federalism and the scope of federal power vis-à-vis the states makes it difficult to conclude with certainty that he would, if confirmed to the Supreme Court, be as receptive to federalism based arguments as was Justice Scalia. What is apparent is his clear interest in upholding the "essential principles of federal-state comity" in If confirmed to the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch could have a significant influence on the jurisprudence regarding freedom of religion. In recent years, the Court has taken up a number of religious freedom cases, with Justice Scalia voting as part of five-Justice majorities to interpret more narrowly the Constitution's prohibition on the "establishment of religion," while joining the same voting block to more broadly.furtherance of a cooperative federalism by deferring to the states when circumstances so warrant. If confirmed, he would be the fifth member of the Court to vote on the issue. expansively interpret statutory free exercise protections. A central constitutional issue respecting freedom of religion that Judge Gorsuch has considered concerns the reach of the First Amendment's prohibition on the establishment of a national religion. In determining what constitutes an unconstitutional act, the Supreme Court has, at times, read to bar certain government actions that endorse religion. The Supreme Court is expected to make a decision on the nomination by the end of the year or early next year, depending on the results of the Senate's confirmation hearings. endorsement of religion, the Court has in the recent past adopted Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's "reasonable observer test" The test looks to whether an "objective observer," acquainted with the background of the challenged government action, would perceive it as a government endorsement of religion. Judge Gorsuch has, in two dissents, criticized what he viewed as overly expansive interpretations of the reasonable observer test on the grounds that these interpretations needlessly eliminate certain religious symbols and traditions from the public sphere. Judge Gorsuch dissented from the denial of a request for rehearing in a case where the panel had previously enjoined a display of the Ten Commandments on a courthouse lawn. In his dissent, the nominee criticized the Tenth Circuit's formulation of the reasonable observer test, describing the observer utilized by the panel decision as an " unreasonable one" who "gets things wrong" He noted a number of perceived errors made by the "unreasonable observer," which included confusing the donor's intent with the government's message. Government with endorsement. Contending that "like cases should be treated alike," Judge Gorsuch's dissent further argued that the county's "inclusive display" of the Ten Commandments was indistinguishable from the display at issue in Van Orden v. Perry. In that case, the Supreme Court had upheld a display of the decalogue among other monuments and historic markers on the grounds of the Texas state capitol. Given these perceived parallels, the nominee's dissent concluded by noting the "long" custom of displaying the Ten commandments in public places. whether the endorsement test even applies to the dispute. Judge Gorsuch's dissent is reminiscent of recent Supreme Court jurisprudence, where a majority of the Justices, including Justice Scalia, appeared to move to looking to historical practices and understandings to resolve Establishment Clause disputes. Nearly two years after Green , Judge Gorsuch similarly dissented from an order denying en banc rehearing in American Atheists, Inc. v. Davenport. In that case, the panel had relied on the reasonable observer test in holding that the display of twelve-foot high crosses on public lands to memorialize fallen Utah Highway was OK. Patrol troopers violated the Establishment Clause. Judge Gorsuch again raised concerns about the Tenth Circuit's interpretation of Justice O'Connor's test. In particular, the dissent criticized what the nominee viewed as the observer's (1) "biased presumption that the Utah roadside crosses are unconstitutional"; (2) "internal bias" that disregarded "secularizing details" about the cross display; and (3) "selective and feeble eyesight," which resulted in misperceptions about the nature of theCross display. Gorsuch's dissent in American Atheists criticized the concept of the reasonable observer. He said it could be used to strike down laws and policies a conjured observer could mistakenly think respect an establishment of religion. He also said the test differs from other formulations the Court has used in the Establishment Clause context in that it can be used "to strike down law and policies ... a reasonably biased, impaired, and distracted viewer might confuse them for an endorsement of religion" The dissent was published in the online edition of American Atheist. Atheists expressed skepticism regarding interpretations of the First Amendment that discourage accommodation for religious views. He appears to favor an approach that is more restrained in using the power of judicial review in Establishment Clause cases. Judge Gorsuch's most notable writings on freedom of religion may arise in the context of statutory free exercise claims. He authored or joined opinions involving challenges under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) to the contraceptive coverage requirement in the Affordable Care Act. He also joined opinions in two cases subsequently reviewed by the Supreme Court. Care Act (ACA) RFRA provides that federal laws that substantially burden a person's exercise of religion are permissible only if they are the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest. In the 2013 en banc decision in Hobby Lobby v. Sebelius , Judge Gorsuch joined the lead opinion of Judge Timothy Tymkovich and wrote a separate concurrence. In Hobby Lobby , two closely held corporations, whose owners chose to "run their business to reflect their religious values," challenged the contraceptive requirement. causes the death of a human embryo." The majority of the Tenth Circuit concluded that the ACA contraceptive coverage requirement likely created a substantial burden on the organization's free exercise rights. The Tenth Circuit deferred to the plaintiff's conception of its religious beliefs, and, viewing the dilemma posed by the contraceptive policy as a "Hobson's choice" in which the corporations and its owners could pay substantial fines for violating the requirement or "compromise their religious beliefs," concluded the policy amounted to a burden. to a substantial burden. On appeal to the Supreme Court, a five-Justice majority (including Justice Scalia) largely agreed with the Tenth Circuit's assessment and affirmed the lower court. Judge Tymkovich's opinion concluded that the existence of a wide range of exemptions to the requirement undermined the government's justifications for the policy and demonstrated that the policy was not the least restrictive means of achieving these goals. Judge Gorsuch's concurring opinion in Hobby Lobby was centrally focused on procedural matters tangential to the case. RFRA claims, did discuss the substantive claims in broader terms than the majority opinion, suggesting that the nominee may have a clear preference for accommodation in free exercise disputes. Noting that RFRA was enacted for the express purpose of "vindicating this nation's long-held aspiration to serve as a refuge of religious tolerance," Judge Gorsuch's concurrence emphasized that courts should largely defer to the assertions about the nature of religious beliefs made by those who sincerely hold these beliefs, both out of respect for religious liberty and because of the judiciary's limited competence to scrutinize such beliefs. Gorsuch emphasized that it made little difference that the burden on the plaintiffs in Hobby Lobby did not stem from the government affirmatively requiring their use of a "particular drug or device" This was because the plaintiffs had argued that the government imposed a religious burden by requiring their "personal involvement in facilitating . . . [the destruction of] a fertilized human egg that their religious faith holds impermissible," he said. As a result, Judge Gorsuch's Hobby Lobby concurrence viewed RFRA as a "tie-breaker" that Congress designed to. "override other legal mandates, including its own statutes, if and when they encroach on religious liberty," he wrote. Two years later, Judge Gorsuch joined an opinion in Little Sisters of the Poor v. Burwell that repeated many of the themes of his Hobby Lobby concurrence. The central issue was whether allowing religious entities that objected to the ACA requirement to fill out a form that would functionally require a third-party insurer to provide the coverage violates the free speech rights of religious groups. Judge Harris Hartz, joined by four other judges, dissented from the decision not to rehear a case dismissing a challenge to this government accommodation policy. Hartz's opinion criticized the panel's refusal "to acknowledge that [the plaintiff's] religious belief is that execution of the [accommodation] documents is sinful" In so doing, the dissent in Little Sisters of the Poor can be seen to have repeated many of the themes from Judge Gorsuch's Hobby Lobby concurrence by Judge Hartz. describing the majority approach as "dangerous . . . to religious liberty" because it is "not the job of the judiciary to tell people what their religious beliefs are" On appeal, the High Court agreed to hear multiple lower court decisions on this issue. In the consolidated case, Zubik v. Burwell , ordered the respective circuit courts to reconsider the cases after affording the parties time to reach a compromise that would provide contraceptive coverage without imposing the alleged burden on the challenging entities. Gorsuch has emphasized the importance of accommodating religious beliefs in other statutory free exercise challenges. For instance, in Yellowbear v. Lambert , Judge Gorsuch, writing on behalf of a three-judge panel, held that a Wyoming prison lacked a right to practice its religion. The close division of the current Court on free exercise matters may reflect the close division on the issue. The Supreme Court is expected to hear the case in the next few weeks. The case will be heard in the Supreme Court's San Francisco branch. a sufficiently compelling interest in imposing a substantial burden on the religious exercise of an inmate who was an enrolled member of the Northern Arapaho Tribe. In so doing, the nominee articulated two relatively pro-plaintiff interpretations of free exercise law. Similarly, in Abdulhaseeb v. Calbone , Judge Gorsuch joined the court in determining a claimant's sincerity. He rejected a conception of the compelling interest inquiry that would allow the government to rely on abstract interests to satisfy its burden under RLUIPA. the majority opinion and authored a concurring opinion reinstating several RLUIPA claims based on an Oklahoma prison's denial of an Islamic prisoner's request for a halal certified diet. In his concurrence, the nominee emphasized that the inmate's charge was that he was denied "all means of accessing food [that] he can eat consistent with his . . . sincerely held religious beliefs" The claim that "lies at [the] heart" of a statutory free exercise claim, he said, is that the prison "effectively forcing him to choose between remaining pious or starving" Gorsuch's concurrence in Abdulhaseeb rejected the prisoner's other claims, including the claim that the prison had violated his rights under RLUIPA merely by placing "jell-o and pudding" on the cafeteria tray. For a plaintiff "to win" under the law "takes no small effort," he said. Such laws do "not offer refuge to canny operators who seek through through," he added. The Supreme Court is expected to hear the case in the coming weeks. subterfuge to avoid laws they'd prefer to ignore. Judge Gorsuch is apt to interpret statutory free exercise laws, much like the Establishment Clause, to embrace the role of religion in society. But there are limits to how far free exercise can go, he says. The Supreme Court should be careful not to over-interpret RFRA, he writes. The court should also be wary of the effect of RFRA on religious freedom, he adds. "There are limits" to free exercise, the court should be aware of. to the degree to which he will defer to the purported interests suggested by claimants seeking to rely upon such laws. The Supreme Court has issued a number of notable opinions over the past decade respecting the First Amendment and freedom of speech. Many of the Court's recent First Amendment rulings have been closely divided, and the eight-member Court split evenly during the October 2015 term on a notable case regarding the First amendment and free speech. Some legal scholars and practitioners have described the Roberts Court as the "strongest First Amendment Supreme Court in our history" Gorsuch's work on the Tenth Circuit has broached the issue of campaign finance regulation and the First Amendment. The nominee has authored or joined a handful of opinions touching on free speech issues. Given this, if confirmed by the Senate, Judge Gorsuch could have a significant influence on the future direction of free speech law. The Supreme Court has invalidated a number of federal and state election laws at the margins. For example, in the en banc ruling in Hobby Lobby, the court invalidated the law. Gorsuch joined the majority opinion that concluded that the "logic" of Citizens United v. FEC "compelled the conclusion that the First Amendment also protects a corporation's religious expressions" A lower court's reliance on Supreme Court precedent may not necessarily signal agreement with that precedent, as noted by one of the concurring opinions in Hobby Lobby , the judge said. The opinion was part of the dissent in Sebelius.v. Hobby Lobby, a case that the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby. disagreement between the members of the Court in Citizens United was more complex than whether the First Amendment protects a corporation's speech. In other words, Judge Gorsuch's vote in the 2013 en banc case may have limited significance with respect to his broader views on the constitutionality of campaign finance laws. Riddle v. Hickenlooper, a 2014 case that invalidated a Colorado law, may offer more insights as to his views on First Amendment and campaign finance regulation. The case involved whether the "asserted inclinations and advantages of corporations in corrupting officeholders" justified restricting corporate campaign expenditures. allowing major party candidates to accept twice as much in contributions per individual as independent and minor party candidates. Judge Gorsuch agreed with the majority that the Colorado law violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. He attempted to allay fears that the ruling "imperiled" any attempts to regulate campaign contributions, citing federal law as a nondiscriminatory model available to the State of Colorado. In so concluding, however, the concurrence broadly concluded that the law was unconstitutional. noted that the "act of contributing to political campaigns implicates a 'basic constitutional freedom," one lying "at the foundation of a free society" The nominee then observed that despite the First Amendment interests in campaign contributions, the Supreme Court "has yet to apply strict scrutiny to contribution limit challenges" Some commentators conclude that the nominee may favor subjecting campaign finance restrictions, including contribution restrictions, to the most stringent standard of review. Other legal scholars have read Judge Gorsuch's opinion in Riddle to "simply highlight the confusion he saw" on the proper level of scrutiny. , Judge Gorsuch wrote broadly about the underlying dangers of suppression of speech by government officials. When public officials feel free to wield the powers of their office as weapons against those who question their decisions, they do damage not merely to the citizen in their sights but also to the First Amendment liberties and the promise of equal treatment essential to the continuity of our democratic enterprise, he wrote. With this backdrop, the nominee rejected the county's argument that the plaintiff's tax assessment challenges did not amount to "constitutionally protected activity" Gorsuch has written or joined a number of opinions that promote the rights of the press at the expense of plaintiffs in certain state tort actions. In Bustos v. A&E Television, he said the First Amendment "extends to matters great and small, public and private" That may align him with the majority of the Roberts Court that has, in recent years, rejected the argument that the first Amendment does not protect certain "low value" speech, says Julian Zelizer, a professor at the University of Notre Dame. Judge says a prisoner who "merely conspired with" the Aryan Brotherhood could not sustain a defamation lawsuit. The First Amendment requires a plaintiff pursuing a defamation claim to prove the underlying falsehood of the statement at issue, he says. Judge Gorsuch joined a panel opinion in Cory v. Allstate Insurance , which dismissed a defamation suit against the insurance company. The decision held that the plaintiff had failed to show the History Channel's statement had a significant impact on his reputation, the judge says. Gorsuch's opinions have recognized limits to the First Amendment's speech protections. He joined opinions that dismissed privacy tort claims on First Amendment grounds. The nominee should not be viewed as a free speech absolutist, writes Julian Zelizer. He says the underlying reported events involved protected speech on matters of public concern. For more information, visit CNN.com/soulmatestories and follow us on Twitter @cnnstl and @julian Zelizer on Facebook. the First Amendment precludes defamation actions aimed at parody, even when involving a private figure on a matter of private concern. In the context of public employee speech, the nominee has authored several opinions limiting or dismissing First Amendment lawsuits brought by government employees against their employers. The speech occurred pursuant to the employees' official duties and, therefore, could be regulated by the government. With regard to challenges to zoning ordinances, he authored a concurring opinion that raised the question of whether constitutionalizing the protections for such parodies was necessary or wise. Gorsuch dissented from the denial of a petition for en banc rehearing. In so doing, he contended that the underlying panel decision interpreted the First Amendment too broadly. In a case raising issues similar to those in a case presently before the Court, Judge Gorsuch joined an opinion holding that a Utah law requiring registered sex workers to register was unconstitutional. He said it made it harder to regulate the secondary effects of adult businesses. The case is Doe v. Shurtleff, which is now before the Supreme Court. offenders to provide the government with their usernames and online identifiers for certain websites was a permissible content-neutral regulation of speech. Justice Scalia's written work and public speeches reflected distinct attitudes toward the use of contemporary foreign law and practice, ratified treaties, and international custom to inform understanding of the U.S. Constitution and federal statutes. In contrast, due in part to the nature of the Tenth Circuit's docket, Judge Gorsuch's jurisprudence offers comparatively little guidance as to his likely approach on such matters. lead him, like Justice Scalia, to eschew consideration of contemporary foreign practice as an aid to interpreting the Constitution's meaning. The Tenth Circuit docket involves few cases touching upon international law issues, and the handful of cases considered by Judge Gorsuch in this area has been unremarkable. In short, if Judge Gorsuch has any distinctive leanings with respect to questions regarding the interpretation or enforceability of international law in U.S. courts, they are not apparent. The nominee has not addressed such matters in the cases that have come before him. in his judicial writings to date. Judge Gorsuch has touched upon the Second Amendment and the constitutionality of firearms regulations briefly in his written opinions while on the Tenth Circuit. However, none of these cases purported to explore the scope of the 2nd Amendment's protections or the Supreme Court's decisions in District of Columbia v. Heller and McDonald v. City of Chicago. These writings suggest that Judge Gorsuch views the2nd Amendment as generally protecting an individual right to bear arms, a position that could be seen as consistent with the originalist approach often ascribed to him. Judge Gorsuch's references to the Second Amendment have generally appeared in cases concerned with how to construe federal criminal statutes. In a dissent from the Tenth Circuit's denial of en banc review in United States v. Games-Perez, he said gun possession is often lawful and sometimes even protected as a matter of constitutional right. The remaining mentions of firearms in Judge Gorsuch's opinions arise in contexts that do not directly raise Second Amendment claims, and could be seen to reflect other factors beyond the nominee's views about gun possession. Supreme Court nominee is a proponent of reinvigorating the non-delegation doctrine. Julian Zelizer: Judge Gorsuch has objected to what he views as Congress foisting legislative authority onto the judiciary. He says the combination of legislative and judicial functions poses a grave threat to liberty, fair notice, and equal protection. Zelizer says if elevated to the Supreme Court, Judge Gorsuch could be expected to reject "functionalist" approaches to the separation of powers."Formalist" approach is an evaluation of strict delineations of governmental powers set forth in the Constitution. Gorsuch has also taken exception to the executive branch engaging in activities he regards as judicial functions. In a pair of cases interpreting two statutory provisions, one permitting the Attorney General to grant relief from removal to aliens and the other prohibiting it, he applied—but objected to—the Supreme Court's precedent in Chevron and Brand X. These two cases, which are discussed in more detail above, generally permit agency decisions to override, he says. The Supreme Court has ruled that agency decisions can be overruled. judicial decisions where statutory ambiguity is identified. In De Niz Robles v. Lynch , Judge Gorsuch established for the majority that there is a presumption of prospectivity to agency exercises of delegated legislative authority unless Congress has clearly authorized retroactivity. In reaching this conclusion, Judge Gorsuch let it be known that, if not bound by Supreme Court precedent, the court would have thought it improbable that the Framers had envisioned that an executive branch agency could ever overrule a federal court in the first place. question, the Board of Immigration Appeals again applied its own reinterpretation of the immigration statutes retroactively. Judge Gorsuch, writing for the majority in Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch , held the retroactive application invalid. He also penned a solo concurrence to take note of the "elephant in the room": [T]he fact is Chevron and Brand X permit executive bureaucracies to swallow huge amounts of core judicial and legislative power, he wrote. He wrote that to do otherwise would raise due process and equal protection concerns. Gorsuch: "Powerful and centralized authorities like today's administrative agencies . . . warrant less deference from other branches, not more" He cites to Justice Felix Frankfurter's concurrence in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer. He dismissed more functionalist arguments in favor of a "titanic administrative state," he says. "Maybe the time has come to face the behemoth," he adds. "It's time to face it" for the first time. noting the dangers of '"unchecked disregard of the restrictions' imposed by the Constitution." Judge Gorsuch's Gutierrez-Brizuela concurrence may suggest that if he is elevated to the High Court, he may embrace a more formalist approach to separation-of-powers questions. The Supreme Court has been divided in recent years in cases involving the substantive component of the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The source for various unenumerated rights that have been recognized by the Court as constitutionally protected. right to an abortion, and the right to marry. Justice Scalia was a vocal critic of the substantive due process doctrine. While serving on the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch has authored or joined a few opinions that touch on the substantiveDue process. He regularly joined majority opinions that limited the scope of the doctrine. He dissented in cases where the Court recognized new fundamental liberty interests. The nominee's expressed views on the doctrine are arguably less apparent and certainly less voluminous than Justice Scalia's. In 2011 case, Kerns v. Bader, Judge Gorsuch dismissed the substantive due process claims brought by a plaintiff. Noting that the government's "mere collection of information" without any further public dissemination of it is a violation of due process. Judge has never squarely ruled on the right to an abortion or to marry, but his opinions do provide some insights into his views on substantive due Process rights. He has written on behalf of a divided panel in the case, in which a county sheriff had violated the plaintiff's rights to informational privacy. that information does not implicate rights to informational privacy, Judge Gorsuch dismissed the claim on qualified immunity grounds. The dissent, however, called the majority's conclusion on the privacy issue "dismaying" The dissent argued that it was "patently clear" that "individuals have a constitutional right to have their medical records kept private from law enforcement officers pursuing general investigative ends and acting in the absence of any authority to breach that privacy" Nonetheless, while acknowledging the dissent's eloquence, Judge Scalia said, "I don't think there's any reason to think that this case would go the other way" concluded that it was inappropriate to resolve the "complex" Fourteenth Amendment "questions surrounding medical records," especially in the context of a qualified immunity challenge. The second opinion—perhaps the most notable substantive due process opinion authored by Judge Gorsuch—is Browder v. City of Albuquerque. This 2015 opinion held that the plaintiffs' substantive due Process rights had been violated in thecontext of a lawsuit arising from a "terrible crash" that resulted when a police officer raced through the street. A three-judge panel upheld a district court order that declined to dismiss the substantive due process claims brought against the officer by the victims of the crash. In so holding, Judge Gorsuch broadly discussed the substantivedue process doctrine. Describing the doctrine as having a "paradoxical name" and being a "murky area" of law, he noted the view that the doctrine either misplaces the source of due process or misleads the public.city streets of Albuquerque in his police cruiser after finishing his shift. One of the victims died and the other suffered serious injuries. fundamental rights in the Due Process Clause or has no basis whatsoever in the Constitution. The Browder majority continued by explaining that the "doctrine should be applied and expanded sparingly" because of the open ended nature of substantive due process. In particular, relying on concurring opinions authored by Justices Kennedy and Scalia in a 1998 Supreme Court opinion, Judge Gorsuch then observed that "history and precedent" and the plaintiff's state of mind are critical guideposts to cabin the inquiry into the case. whether a fundamental right has been infringed under the Due Process Clause. The extensive discussion of substantive due process and the limits on the doctrine in both the majority and concurring opinions in Browder is notable. The majority decision ultimately concluded that the underlying legal questions raised by the case did not broach "any serious borderline disputes" As a result, the extensive concerns raised by Judge Gorsuch in his Browder opinions may signal the nominee's skepticism toward the application of the Doctrine in cases presenting less egregious fact patterns. extensive writings on fundamental rights and substantive due process are found not in his court opinions, but in his outside work. During the 2006 confirmation hearing for his seat on the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch stated that, while his "writings" on euthanasia and assisted suicide were, in his view, "consistent with the Supreme Court's decisions . . . and existing law," his "personal views" as expressed in his writings "have nothing to do with the case before me," he said. better than that" and "the law demands more than that." In fact, much of the book has little to do with the law. At its heart, the book explores the various ethical arguments regarding assisted suicide and euthanasia. Judge Gorsuch argues that "the intentional taking of a human life by private persons is always wrong" The book does not address "publicly authorized forms of killing like capital punishment and war," nor does it address assisted suicide or euthanasia as a medical procedure. It ultimately lodging an argument against their legalization "based on secular moral theory" seek to define what is encompassed by the term "human life" In assessing the philosophical arguments related to assisted suicide and euthanasia, the nominee addressed key legal doctrines implicating the right to die. The legal discussion in Judge Gorsuch's book raises broader questions about the substantive due process doctrine and how to assess when a fundamental right is protected by the clause. The book centers on two Supreme Court cases from 1997, Washington and D.C., that addressed assisted suicide, euthanasia and due process. v. Glucksberg and Vacco v. Quill that collectively upheld state laws that outlawed assisted suicide against substantive due process and equal protection challenges. Judge Gorsuch devotes a chapter to questions related to determining whether a right to assisted suicide can be justified by looking at past historical practices. He notes that the test is the subject of "considerable methodological disputes," including "what 'level' of historical abstraction" is needed, and "how far back" in history the test should be evaluated. The book does not expressly reject the historical test for substantive due process, nor does it attempt to resolve the debate over the test's "methodological warts" Instead, Judge Gorsuch, "seeking to apply the history test faithfully," examines the "historical record broadly in terms of time and at different levels of abstraction" He concludes that there is limited support for a historical right to assisted suicide. The book is available at www.look.com/judgegorsong and on Amazon. Gorsuch's 2006 book examines the historical test for determining which liberty interests are protected by the Due Process Clause. He also examines what he calls the "reasoned judgment" approach whereby "moral reasoning" and "critical discourse"dictate what constitutes a fundamental right. The writings of a nominee to the Supreme Court, especially those authored before the nominee became a judge, may not fully represent the nominee's current views, writes Julian Zelizer. Zelizer: If elevated to the Court, Judge Gorsuch could hear takings from the federal government over compensation claims.

==================== [27/100] ====================
Summary:
Obesity rates have risen substantially in recent decades. 32% of Americans' calorie intake from 2005-2008 came from foods consumed outside the home. Calorie labeling on menus has been shown to change consumer behavior. New research on nutrition labeling of menus and menu boards may be successful in helping consumers lower their overall calorie intake, the authors say. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have deemed menu labeling a "winnable battle," they say. They say the approach is supported by the American Heart Association, the American Medical Association and others. Before passage of the ACA, restaurant-type food and food from vending machines were exempt from nutrition labeling authorities in the FFDCA. Infant formula and medical foods, which are subject to other labeling requirements, are exempt from the nutrition labeling requirements. Foods with insignificant amounts of more than one-half the required nutrients may use a simplified labeling format. The law also requires restaurants and SRFE to provide calorie information adjacent to self-service food (i.e., salad bars, buffet lines, and cafeteria lines) At issue is the scope of covered establishments. Some have argued that Option 1 is too broad and that grocery and convenience stores should not be covered by the rule. Some Members of Congress have proposed legislation directing the FDA to narrowly interpret the law by excluding primarily retail entities, because the perceived burden of including those entities outweighs the perceived potential benefits. The proposed legislation has not yet been voted on by the House of Representatives or the Senate, but it is expected to be voted on in the coming months. as movie theaters, bowling alleys, bookstore cafes, and all establishments that sell restaurant-like food to consumers. Some Members of Congress, with support from the grocery industry, have expressed concern over Option 1. Some have introduced legislation that would define SRFE as establishments that derive more than 50% of their revenue from restaurant-type food, similar to the proposed Option 2 in Table 1. Members ofCongress who advocate for a broader definition of SRFE note that Congress intended the law to apply to "restaurants as well as other retail food establishments" of floor space devoted to food and regardless of whether food sales constitute a large or small portion of the establishments' total business. This would include food outlets such as movie theaters, bowling alleys, and other entertainment venues, as well as grocery and convenience stores. Those who argue for the narrower version, including industry groups such as the Food Marketing Institute, feel that the FDA has overstepped its statutory authority. They feel that grocery stores should not be included in the rule for a number of reasons, including disproportionate burden on grocery stores. the scope of the agency's authority to regulate supermarkets. They have argued for a narrower definition of the term that does not include supermarkets as SRFE, which the FDA has acknowledged as less burdensome. The state and local menu labeling regulations that have been enacted in the United States generally do not apply to grocery stores. Some have argued that congressional intent in drafting the provision that was eventually enacted as part of the ACA was not to broaden the scope of those laws. The original sponsors of the bill disagree. increased their share of the market in sales of restaurant-type food. One question for policymakers is whether the inclusion of supermarkets and convenience stores is instrumental to the effectiveness of the menu labeling law. In anticipation of the final rule, some establishments have moved forward with menu labeling. McDonald's, the largest fast food company in the United States, announced in September 2012 that it would list calorie information on its menu. The law is expected to take effect in the fall of this year or early next year. on all restaurant and drive-thru menu boards. Under the ACA, covered establishments are required to provide calorie and nutrition information for "food that is a standard menu item" These items include combination meals, variable menu items, self-service food, and food on display. Under ACA Section 4205, now FFDCA Section 403(q)(5)(H), foods that do not require labeling in restaurants and SRFE are custom orders, which are prepared in a specific manner at the customer's request. per calendar year; part of a customary market test; and condiments available for general use, such as salt, pepper, and ketchup, that every customer has access to. The proposed rule further specifies the foods that would require labeling and food that would be exempt under the proposed rule are listed in Table 2. It proposed definitions for restaurant food and restaurant-type food, standard menu items, and combination meals. Under its proposed rule, the FDA also tentatively concluded that the new menu labeling requirements do not apply. The proposed definition of restaurant-type food would mean that grab-and-go items would also be regulated. Grocers argue that the FDA's estimate would be accurate if the rule only applied to restaurant food. The FDA estimates the cost of a menu board at $550. Industry estimates range as high as $1,500 per menu board. The proposed rule includes clarification of several concepts that were noted but not defined in the ACA, including the medium (i.e., menu, table tent, place mat) and placement. The restaurant or SRFE must also provide a statement concerning daily recommended caloric intake, presented in a manner that enables the public to understand the significance of each item in the context of a total daily diet. A 2,000 calorie diet daily diet is used as the basis for general nutrition advice; however, individual calorie needs may vary. The proposed rule would require covered entities to post a succinct statement about daily recommended calorie intake on menus and menu boards. The proposal would also require that additional nutrition information is available upon request. require that covered establishments declare calories on menus and menu boards to the nearest 5-calorie increment up to and including 50 calories. The FDA proposes use of the "80-120 rule" that is currently the standard for prepackaged food. In the proposed rule, the FDA requested comment and consumer research on five different options for disclosing the calorie and nutrient content for standard menu items that come in different flavors, varieties, or combinations. Using an average or median value; using an average and range; using slashes to separate calorie. disclosure when there are only two varieties; and either a range or an average if there are more varieties. The law requires that all nutrient content disclosures must have a reasonable basis. Some Members of Congress and the restaurant industry have asserted that the FDA has misinterpreted the "reasonable basis" that restaurants and SRFE must have for nutrient disclosures in the proposed rule. According to the law, the required nutritional information could be determined using nutrient databases, cookbooks, laboratory analyses, labels on packaged foods. The FDA is proposing a rule that would allow some deviation from calorie counts. The rule would apply to pre-packaged food, where preparation is largely mechanized. Some note that restaurant food preparation is generally done by human hands, and thereby subject to greater variation in calorie content. The FDA estimates a cost of $269 per item to determine this information, while some industry groups have determined it will cost as much as $500 to $1,000 per item. The proposed rule is expected to be voted on later this year. preparation, making it more challenging to adhere to the 80-120 rule. Critics note that wide variation due to individual order preparation was one of the reasons the FDA exempted restaurant food from the NLEA regulations in 1993. The restaurant industry has argued that adhering to a stricter standard of "reasonable basis" may discourage smaller independent operators from participating voluntarily. Calorie counts may also be difficult to determine due to varying portion sizes. In grocery stores, foods that are "packaged and prepared for immediate consumption" are exempt. not always pre-portioned (e.g., deli items), which means that these items will not be served in standardized portions. Some feel that these should be labeled as per portion, rather than whole item. Pizza companies have argued against "whole pie" labeling, because they feel it is not an accurate representation of what an individual would typically eat in one sitting. FDA does not have mandatory recall authority for food that is deemed misbranded due to nutrition labeling. Although the FDA does. was allowed to enforce certain provisions in Section 4205 upon enactment of the ACA, it has proposed to refrain from enforcement until it has completed rulemaking. The FDA generally does not have the authority to order a recall of a misbranded food, unless it is deemed misbranded under allergen labeling regulations. Rather, the agency relies on food companies to voluntarily recall adulterated, misbranded, or otherwise unsafe products, either on their own or on the advice of the Food and Drug Administration. In the proposed rule, the FDA provides a six-month window for restaurants and SRFE to comply. Industry representatives have requested a longer timeline of one year for full compliance. Failure to comply with the regulations, once finalized, will render the food misbranded. If the language regarding the 80-120 rule is included in the finalrule, the accuracy of restaurant calorie information would be determined using the same standards as packaged foods. The restaurant industry has argued that the six- months window for compliance is not enough time for their constituents. The FDA's final determination on these definitions and the timeline for compliance and enforcement activities will affect the regulation's scope and cost. Faced with the possibility of budget cuts, it is unclear if the FDA will have the funding to enforce a strict interpretation of the accuracy of calorie and other nutrition information. However, the eventual public health benefit to fully comply is likely to outweigh the cost of implementing this rule. The cost and burden imposed on businesses implementing the rule is also likely to be a concern. FDA estimates initial cost of compliance at $315 million and ongoing annual cost of the provision at $44 million. Industry estimates the cost will exceed $1 billion in the first year. FDA also notes that the.society may also be weighed; quantification of this benefit can be challenging. The FDA's PRIA points to three elements of cost for this rule: (1) collecting and managing nutritional analysis records; (2) revising or replacing existing menus and menu boards; and (3) employee training. FDA estimated that 27% of chain restaurants have already obtained nutrition information to comply with those state and local regulations. The Office of Management (OMB) is to review the regulations promulgated under the law to ensure, among other considerations, that they are consistent with Executive Orders 12866 and 13563, which require agencies to promulgate rules only after determining that the benefits of a regulation justify its costs, according to a report by the Center for Restaurant and Hospitality Innovation (CRH) require agencies to tailor their regulations to impose the least burden on society and to select approaches that maximize net benefits. Researchers have projected that more than half of Americans will be obese by 2030. Increases in weight are linked to increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, osteoarthritis, and several forms of cancer. It has been documented that obesity leads to decreased productivity, in terms of increased absenteeism as well as what researchers deem "presenteeism" (decreased outputs while at work) Obesity accounts for approximately 1% to 10% of a country's total health care costs. Obese individuals have medical costs that are 30% higher than individuals of normal weight. A recent study estimated that the annual medical cost of obesity was as high as $78.5 billion in 1998. Of that amount, about 10% was spent on medical care for the obese, according to the study. The study was conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. roughly half of the cost was financed by Medicare and Medicaid. The authors estimated that cost may have risen to as much as $147 billion in 2008. The true cost and savings from any obesity prevention policy is challenging to determine. Researchers cannot isolate the effect of one specific policy relative to other interventions. In order to determine the effectiveness of an intervention such as menu labeling, researchers and policy makers may review the impact of these policies on individuals' behavior and monitor changes in the obesity rate over time. taking into account other factors that may also account for those changes, including the time needed for weight loss and obesity prevention programs to yield an effect, particularly on chronic disease costs. Taking into account the time it takes for weight-loss and obesity-prevention programs to pay off, such as the cost of those programs to start and maintain a healthy body mass index (BMI) and the amount of time needed to get to a healthy weight. The cost of obesity-related illnesses can also be influenced by a number of factors, including age, race and gender.

Summary:
“Concessions” are private or public entities using federally owned/leased property under a government contract, permit, license, or other similar agreements. Concessions services included, but were not limited to, food operations, vending machines, retail shops, public pay telephones, barber/beauty shops, transportation, lodging, marinas, and campgrounds. We excluded day care centers, employee association stores, and services provided by visually impaired persons under the Randolph-Sheppard Act. Local governments supply many of the services and accommodations provided on federal property to the public. Each year, millions of people use the services made possible through these agreements. A long-term agreement, which generally involves a large financial investment by the concessioner for construction or capital improvements, may last up to 50 years. A short-term permit or license, which typically requires little or no financial investment in facilities by the concessionser, mayLast up to 5 years. Each agency is responsible for developing, implementing, and monitoring its concessions program to ensure that No overall federal concessions policy exists. Concessions services include food service, retail sales, ski resorts, lodging, and marinas. Most agreements provide that the concessioner will pay the government either a flat fee or a percentage of gross revenues. The primary purpose of the six land management agencies’ concessions programs is to encourage operation of a public-private partnership to provide recreation for visitors to national parks, forests, and other public lands and waters. The federal government receives a fair return from the partnership. Nonland management agencies such as the General Services Administration and U.S. Postal Service provide concessions services. The primary purpose of their concessions programs is to provide high-quality merchandise and convenient services at reasonable prices. Their concessions services include food service, retail sales such as gift shops, vending machines, and coin-operated photocopiers. Since the mid 1970s, we have conducted several reviews of the concessions programs in the land management agencies. (See the list of Related GAO Products on pp. 43 and 44.) were to determine (1) the extent of concessions operations in the federal government, (2) the rate of return received by the federalGovernment from concessions, and (3) how the federalgovernment’s rate ofreturn compared to other governments’ rates of return. The report also looked at the amount of nonconcessions activities that generated income in fiscal year 1994 and whether they offered opportunities for the agencies to handle them like concessions. To accomplish objectives one, two, and four, we sent 3 questionnaires to the 75 federal government entities listed in appendix I. information on all concessions operations and detailed agreement-specific information (including copies of the concessions agreements) on each agreement that was either initiated or extended during fiscal year 1994. We interviewed federal concessions management staff at both headquarters and field levels and nonprofit organizations interested in concessions issues. We obtained and reviewed the laws, regulations, and policies for each federal entity’s concessions operations. Further, if concessions services in agencies were provided under agreements with GSA, we requested agencies not to include these operations in their responses. agreements comes from only the agency’s questionnaire responses for the agreements. We checked selected responses against copies of the concessions agreements sent to us, checked agency totals for concessions revenues and fees against our prior reports. Because agencies did not collect revenue data on all concessions, we could calculate the rate of return only for those agreements where agencies reported both the revenues and fee data. As shown in appendix III, we used the detailed information they provided on agreements containing both revenue and feeData that that were either initiated or extended in fiscal year 1994. We calculated the rate of return by dividing gross revenues into the sum of concessions fees and special accounts. We also sent a questionnaire to five state governments and Canada. We selected the five states on the basis of each government’s rates of return. The National Parks and Conservation Association is a private, nonprofit citizens organization. It is organized to protect, preserve, and enhance national parks and conservation areas of the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Report: 27 of 75 federal departments and agencies surveyed reported having concessions agreements in effect during fiscal year 1994. Six land management agencies accounted for over 92 percent of the concessions. Report: Government received over $82 million from concessions operations in 1994. Canada reported on average a 12.7 percent overall federal rate of return from its concessions operations, compared with 2.8 percent for the U.S. National Park System. The states of Maryland, Michigan, and Missouri were noted by the National Parks Conservation Association as having high rates of return. Concessions agreements entered into on a competitive basis had higher rates of return than those that were not competed. Concessions Policy Act of 1965, governing National Park Service concessions, is the only law covering concessions in land management agencies that specifically requires competition. Officials from five states said none of their concessions staff had procurement backgrounds. They reported that they had contracting officers to set policies but delegated concessions management to park managers. They said some operations could not be competed, such as ski areas where major portions of operations are located on private land. Most of the $20.5 billion was to be either deposited in Treasury’s special account or retained by the agency for its use. Agency officials estimated that activities generating $175 million, or about 1 percent, were not conducive to concessions operations. The activities included the sale of hydroelectric power, audiovisual products, coins, medals, and commemorative items; tours of the Hoover Dam; operation of gift shops and reproduction services; and admission to presidential libraries. In appendix VII, the activities varied and included the selling of Hydroelectric Power, Audiovisually Products, Coins, Medals, and Commemorative Items. of the $20.5 billion in income, could be converted into concessions operations. These activities included the sale of hydroelectric power, tours of Hoover Dam, and collection of user or entrance fees. On March 21, 1996, we provided copies of a draft of this report to the heads of the departments of the six land management agencies for comment. We did not ask for comments from all 75 agencies in our survey because to do so would have been impractical. The six agencies accounted for over 92 percent of total concessions. 1996, we discussed the draft report with officials designated by the departments. The officials said they generally agreed with the facts as presented in the draft. Officials from four of the agencies—National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Reclamation—said they agreed with draft report. The report was published in 1996 and is available on the National Park Service website and on the Internet at http://www.nps.gov/nps/nr/nr-nr/npr/nr.html. Bureaus of Land Management and Reclamation—reiterated the statement in our report that the primary purpose of the land management agencies’ concessions programs is to provide a service to the public. Officials from the Forest Service and the Bureau of Reclamation noted that high investments made by some concessioners also affect the rate of return that the government receives. The National Park Service official said the report highlighted two factors required by legislation—preferential right of contract renewal to the existing contractor and granting possessory interest to concessioners. rate of return. National Park Service’s periodic operational reviews of concessioners, which may increase maintenance costs. legislatively required rate control of concessioning’ prices for goods and services. The expense for financial audits to concessioners grossing over 1 million dollars annually that the National Park service requires. Our review was not designed to measure what impact, if any, that operational reviews or rate controls have on a concessioner's profitability or whether all concessioners had financial audits. We would expect, however, that the impact of these factors would be significant. economic market forces for large dollar value concessions would be similar for the National Park Service and other agencies' concessions. It is likely that all larger concessioners would incur the costs of financial and routine maintenance audits, regardless of the agencies’ requirements. Also with respect to prices, the legislative requirement calls for National Park service concessioners’ prices to be comparable to those of similar services and facilities under similar circumstances. Nothing seems to suggest that Park Service concessioners have been directed to set prices at rates below those that one would normally expect to find in the surrounding area. We plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from the date of this letter. At that time, we will send copies to interested congressional committees, the agencies included in our review, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and other interested parties. We will also make copies available to others upon request. The major contributors to this report are listed in appendix.

Twenty-seven of the 75 departments and agencies we surveyed reported that they had concessions operations during fiscal year 1994. Data on all concessioners’ revenues were not available. Some agencies reported that gross revenue data was not available because concessioners paid a flat concessions fee and the agency had no requirement to track gross revenues. As a result, Table II.1 contains overall information reported by the 27 departments and agency. Forty-two departments andagency responded because some had more than one component managing concessions. consequence, total concessions revenues and fees in this table can not be compared to determine the rate of return the government received from concessioners’ revenues. The Central Intelligence Agency did not provide details on its concessions agreements. Agency responded that concessions fees were sometimes waived because of the following reasons: (1) reduced prices on vended items, (2) difficulty in obtaining contractors, (3) a more attractive procurement was needed because of a lack of offerors, and (4) the building is surrounded by many food establishments. Bureau of Reclamation responded that some revenue data were not available mainly because concessioners were not required to report revenues for certain concessions where they generally paid a flat concessions fee. Survey information was not available for the 225 concessions agreements that are managed. The 37 concessioners represent only a portion of the agency’s concessioners, according to the agency.

To accomplish objectives one, two, and four, we used three questionnaires to request data from 75 federal executive departments and agencies listed in the 1993/94 U.S. Government Manual. The first questionnaire requested summary information on all concessions agreements in effect during fiscalyear 1994. The second questionnaire asked for detailed agreement-specific information on each concessions agreements either initiated or extended. amount of revenues and fees, information on whether competition was used to select the concessioner, whether fees was one of the factors considered during competition, and how competed agreements were advertised. The third questionnaire asked for information on agencies’ income-generating activities that were not concessions. We pretested the questionnaires at six federal agencies or agency components: the Department of Agriculture’s Forest Service, the Army Corps of Engineers, the General Services Administration, the Smithsonian, and the Smithsonian. “Concessions” are private or public entities using federally owned/leased property under a government permit, contract, or other similar agreement. Concession services included, but were not limited to, food operations, vending machines, retail shops, public pay telephones, barber/beauty shops, transportation, lodging, and other services. For the purpose of this assignment, we defined “concession’s” as public or private entities using federal property under government permit or contract. marinas, and campgrounds. We excluded day care centers, employee association stores, and services provided by the visually impaired under the Randolph-Sheppard Act. GSA agreed to include these concessions in its response. Twenty-seven of the agencies said they had at least one concessions agreement. Forty-two respondents provided concessions information, because some agencies, such as the Department of the Interior, provide concessions services under an agreement with the GSA. The GSA requested agencies not to includeThese operations in their response. had more than one component managing concessions (see app. II). Fifteen of the 27 agencies either initiated or extended at least 1 concession agreement during fiscal year 1994. The Central Intelligence Agency provided an oral briefing on its concessions program and did not provide any details on its concession agreements. In response to our questionnaires, we received information on 5,000 concessions agreements. Our information about the agreements comes from only the agencies’ questionnaire responses for the agreements. However, to check whether the questionnaires were filled out completely and accurately, we (1) checked selected responses against copies of the concessions agreement. that agencies sent to us; (2) checked agency totals for concessions revenues and fees against prior GAO reports; (3) followed up with agency staff in selected cases to clarify their responses. (4) manually reviewed all pages of each form; (5) had specially trained staff convert the data to computer-readable format and verify their entries. (6) manually checked computerized data against the original forms, including all data on concessions revenues. and fees; and (7) conducted computerized checks for data consistency. used questionnaire financial data for concessions agreements either initiated or extended during fiscal year 1994. From this reported information, we calculated the rate of return by dividing gross revenues into the sum of concessions fees and the amount in special accounts. We excluded questionnaires that did not contain both gross revenue and concessions fee data. In addition to the questionnaire data, we also interviewed federal concessions management staff at both headquarters and field levels and officials of the National Parks and Conservation Association and the National Park Hospitality Association; and (2) reviewed our previous reports. work in this area; Inspector General reports; and laws, regulations, and policies for each federal entity’s concessions operations. We selected the five states on the basis of information we received from the National Parks and Conservation Association. The information showed that these five states had relatively high rates of return. We visited two of the states—Maryland and Tennessee—and met with their officials and officials from the federal government. We used the data we obtained from objectives one, two, and four and sent a questionnaire to five state governments and Canada. with their key concessions managers. We selected Canada to obtain information on another country’s experience. We did our review from January 1995 to November 1995, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Because it was impractical for us to obtain comments from all 75 agencies, we provided copies of a draft of this report to the heads of the departments of the six land management agencies. The six agencies accounted for over 92 percent of the concessions. On March 25, 1996, we discussed the draft report with officials designated by the departments.

Summary:
The Army Guard is the oldest component of any of the uniformed services. It traces its roots to the colonial militia, and claims a “birth”of 1636. Today, the Army Guard exists in 54 locations that include all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and three territories: Guam, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. During peacetime, Army Guard units report to the adjutant generals of their states or territories, or in the case of the District, to the Commanding General. Reports to the governor of the state, or in the case of the District of Columbia, the mayor. At the state level, the governors have the ability, under the Constitution of the United States, to call up members of the Army Guard in times of domestic emergency or need. Army Guard units battle fires or help communities deal with floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, snowstorms, or other emergency situations. In times of civil unrest, the citizens of a state rely on the Army Guards to respond, if needed. The President has the authority to mobilize the Army Guard, putting them in federal duty status. While federalized, the units answer to the Combatant Commander of the theatre in which they are operating and, ultimately, to the President. Nonfederalized Army Guard members’ pay and allowances are paid with state funds while federalized Army Guards are paid for with federal funds. Even when notFederalized, The Army Guard has a federal mission to maintain properly trained and equipped units, available for prompt mobilization. enlist for 8 years and are entitled to a number of benefits while serving in the Army Guard. Army Guard members are required to attend one drill weekend each month and one annual training period (usually 2 weeks in the summer) each year. Initially, all nonprior service personnel are required. to attend initial entry training, also known as Basic Training. After Basic Training, soldiers go to their Advanced training. After their enlistment periods, former Army Guard member are entitled. to veterans’ benefits, such as health care and burial benefits. The Army Guard has armories and training facilities in more than 2,800 communities. The Army Guard is a partner with the active Army and the Army Reserves in fulfilling the country's military needs. The National Guard Bureau (NGB) assists the Army Guard in this partnership. NGB is a joint bureau of the Departments of the Army, the Air Force and is charged with overseeing the federal functions of the National Guard. For more information, visit the Army Guardsman's website or call 1-800-273-8255 or go to http://www.armyguard.org/. NGB helps the Army Guard and the Air Guard procure funding and administer policies. NGB also acts as a liaison between the Departments of the Army and Air Force and the states. All Army forces are integrated under DOD’s “total force” concept. Under this concept, active and reserve components are to be blended into a cohesive total force to meet a given need. The U.S. Army is the largest military service in the world, followed by the European Union and the United States. The President declared a national emergency as a result of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The Secretary of Defense delegated to the Secretary of the Army the authority to order Army Guard soldiers to active duty as part of the overall mobilization effort. Approximately 93,000 Army Guard troops were activated as of March.mission. The U.S. military is committed to the mission of preventing, detecting and responding to acts of terrorism and acts of war. The mission is led by the U.N. Security Council and the United Nations. Army Guard soldiers accounted for 34 percent of the total reserve components mobilized in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Army Guard soldiers participated in direct combat in Afghanistan under Operation Enduring Freedom. U.S. homeland security missions, Operation Noble Eagle, were also part of the 9/11 response. In general, missions to fight terrorism outside the United States were categorized under OperationEnduring Freedom, while missions to provide domestic defense were categorized as OperationNoble Eagle. For more information, visit www.armyguard.org. such as guarding the Pentagon, airports, nuclear power plants, domestic water supplies, bridges, tunnels, and other military assets were conducted under Operation Noble Eagle. The Army Guard also supported federal peacekeeping operations in Southwest Asia with Operation Desert Spring and in Kosovo with Operation Joint Guardian under various other military operations. While on active duty, all Army Guard soldiers earn various statutorily authorized pays and allowances. The types of pay and allowances soldiers are eligible to receive vary depending upon rank and length of service, dependency status, skills and certifications acquired. We focused on 14 basic types of pays and allowances applicable to Army Guard units we selected for case studies. We categorized these 14 pay and allowance types into two groups: (1) pays, including basic pay, special duty assignment pay, parachute jumping and foreign language proficiency skill-based pays, and location-based hostile fire and hardship duty pays. (2) allowances, including allowances for housing, subsistence, family separation, and cost of living for the continental United States. In this case study, we focused on the basic pay and allowances. There are three key phases associated with starting and stopping relevant pays and allowances for mobilized Army Guard soldiers. Army Guard units and state-level command support components, as well as active Army finance components and DFAS, have key roles in this process. There are five key computer systems involved in authorizing, entering, and processing active duty pays for mobilized soldiers. In addition to tax advantages, mobilized soldiers may be eligible for tax advantages associated with their mobilization to active duty, such as exclusion of certain military pay from taxable income.  DFAS Indianapolis is the central site for all Army military pay and is responsible for maintaining over 1 million MMPAs for the Army. Each MMPA contains a soldier’s pay-related personnel, entitlement, and performance data. Personnel data contained in the MMPA are generated by JUSTIS and DMO. All pay- related transactions that are entered into DJMS-RC, through Justis and D MO, update theMMPA. To learn more about DFAS, visit their website.  DFAS Denver is responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining customer requirements for the Military and Civilian Pay Services business line. DFAS-Indianapolis serves as a “gatekeeper” in that it monitors the daily status of data uploaded to DJMS-RC to ensure that all transactions are received and processed in DJ MS-RC. Users can sign on to DJms-RC directly from the Army Guard’s SIDPERS database, which is maintained and used by 54 state-level personnel offices.  JUSTIS is the pay input subsystem used by the 54 state-level Army Guard commands, including the USPFOs. This subsystem processes transactions for submission to DJMS-RC to create payments for Army National Guard soldiers. JUSTIS receives certain pay-affecting personnel data from SIDPERS. It also receives a limited amount of mobilization order data directly from AFCOS. These systems are decentralized in that each of the 54 sites owns and maintains its own JUSTIS database. It is used for file transfer transactions, online queries of MMPAs, and downloads of data files. DMO is the pay input subsystem used by active Army finance offices and the DOD military pay offices to update DJMS-RC. DMO can be used to create transactions for military pay and allowances that are not reported at the time of mobilization for upload. Additional data needed to create pay transactions associated with active duty pay and allowance must be entered manually into JUSTIS from hard copies of mobilization orders.

We found significant pay problems at the six Army Guard units we audited. These problems related to processes, human capital, and systems. The six units included three special forces and three military police units. The units were as follows: Special forces units Colorado B Company, 5th Battalion, 19th Special Forces Virginia B Company. Military police units Mississippi 114th Military Police Company, West Virginia C Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Battalion, 20th Special Armed Forces West Virginia, C Company. Six case study units were deployed to various locations in the U.S. and overseas in support of Operations Noble Eagle and Enduring Freedom. In addition, we conducted a limited review of the pay experiences of a seventh unit mobilized more recently and deployed to Iraq in April 2003. The Colorado Army Guard’s 220th Military Police Company was one of the seven units reviewed. The pay problems we found in our six cases study units persisted, as shown in figure 2. The unit was deployed to help perform a variety of critical tasks. For the six units we audited, we found significant pay problems involving over one million dollars in errors. These problems consisted of underpayments, overpayments and late payments that occurred during all three phases of Army Guard mobilization to active duty. Overall, for the 18- month period from October 1, 2001, through March 31, 2003, we discovered more than $1 million in errors in the Army Guard pay system. The Army Guard was responsible for providing security at the Pentagon shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. identified overpayments, underpayments and late payments at the six case study units. For one unit, these pay problems resulted in largely erroneous debts totaling $1.6 million. Overall, we found that 450 of the 481 soldiers had at least one pay problem associated with their mobilization to active duty. Due to the lack of supporting documents at the state, unit, and battalion levels, we were unable to conduct a full analysis of the pay problems in each case study unit. The study was published in the online edition of the Journal of Military Economics. may not have identified all of the pay problems related to the active duty mobilizations of these units. The payment problems we identified at the six case study units did not include instances of fraudulent payments, which were a major finding resulting from the further investigation of improper payments found in our 1993 audit of Army military payroll. Nonetheless, we found the inaccurate, late, and missing pays and associated erroneous pays. We have provided documentation for the pay issues we identified to appropriate DOD officials for further research to determine whether additional amounts are owed to the government or the soldiers. Debts found during our current audit had a profound financial impact on individual soldiers and their families. DOD erroneously billed 34 soldiers in a Colorado National Guard Special Forces unit an average of $48,000 each. The largely erroneous total debt for these soldiers of about $1.6 million remained unresolved at the end of our audit in September 2003. As a result of confusion over responsibility for entering transactions associated with a Colorado. National Guard unit, DOD mistakenly billed the unit $48k each. Soldier’s spouse had to obtain a grant from the Colorado National Guard to pay bills while her husband was in Afghanistan. Some soldiers did not receive payments for up to 6 months after mobilization and others still had not received certain payments by the conclusion of our audit work. Four Virginia Special Forces soldiers who were injured in Afghanistan and unable to resume their civilian jobs experienced problems in receiving entitled active duty pays and related health care. We found that a substantial number of payment errors were caused, at least in part, by unclear procedural requirements for processing active duty pay. Audit finds Army Guard commands not performing effective reconciliations of pay and personnel record discrepancies each month. Several of the instances we identified in which soldiers received pay and allowances for many months after their release from active duty likely would have been identified sooner. DOD officials did advise us that, as a result of our work, they implemented a software change on September 18, 2003, intended to help avoid such problems in the future. The new warning messages have been added to JUSTIS that will appear when a transaction is entered to cancel or amend a tour of duty. Army Guard soldiers’ active duty pays were not stopped at the end of their active duty tours when they were released from active duty earlier than their units. DFAS-Indianapolis guidance provides only that “the supporting USPFO will be responsible for validating the status of any soldier who does not return to a demobilized status with a unit.” The guidance did not state how the USPfo should be used to carry out assigned responsibilities for soldiers who return fromActive Duty earlier than units. informed that a soldier did not return with his or her unit, or how the USPFO was to take action to validate the status of such soldiers. Data input and eligibility requirements for housing and family separation allowances were not clear, the audit found. A soldier returned early from a deployment when the soldier appeared at a weekend drill while his unit was still deployed. The audit found that procedural guidance was not clear with respect to transaction entry for soldiers returning early from deployment. The U.S. military has been accused of failing to properly vet soldiers who return early from deployments. and eligibility requirements for the basic allowance for housing and the family separation allowance, respectively. For example, during our audit work at one of our case study locations, we determined that because of inconsistent interpretations of existing guidance for “dependents” in entering transactions, a number of Maryland soldiers were not paid the correct amount. At another case study location, we found that existing guidance on eligibility determination was misinterpreted so that soldiers were erroneously refused the “single parent soldiers family separation allowances” to which they were entitled. policies and procedures were unclear with respect to organizational responsibilities. Confusion centered principally around pay processing responsibility for Army Guard soldiers as they move from state control to federal control and back again. To be effective, current processes rely on close coordination and communication between state (Army Guard unit and state-level command organizations) and federal (active Army finance locations at mobilization/demobilization stations and at area servicing finance offices) We found a significant number of instances in which critical coordination requirements were not clearly defined. A sergeant incurred pay problems during his mobilization and deployment to Afghanistan. The active Army and his state's USPFO were confused as to responsibility for processing pay input transactions associated with a promotion. The end result was the soldier was overpaid during the time he was in Afghanistan. A sergeant was promoted from a sergeant first class to master sergeant (E-8) and his demotion back to an E-7, and a second promotion back to a E-8. The sergeant was also overpaid for his deployment and demotion. period of his demotion. DFAS garnished his wages and collected approximately $1,100 of the soldier's salary. The soldier's wife had to obtain a grant of $500 from the Colorado National Guard's Family Support Group to pay bills. We found existing guidance did not provide for clear responsibility and accountability between USPFOs and the Army Guard’s and active Army’S mobilization station and in-theater finance offices to enter transactions for deployed soldiers. However, we found that existing guidance was not clear on who was responsible for the transactions. active Army mobilization stations and in-theater servicing finance offices with respect to responsibility for entering transactions while in the theater. For example, at one of our case study locations, this broad authority for entering changes to soldiers’ pay records enabled almost simultaneous attempts by two different pay offices to enter pay transactions into DJMS-RC for the same soldier. At another case study location we found that, in part because of confusion over responsibility for starting location-based payments, two pay offices tried to enter the same transaction. The West Virginia National Guard Special Forces unit was stationed in Uzbekistan. The unit was experiencing numerous pay problems. The local finance office did not have the systems up and ready, nor available personnel who were familiar with DJMS-RC. According to the sergeant, the active Army finance personnel were only taking care of the active.pays, a soldier was required to carry out a dangerous multiday mission to correct these payments. This page is intentionally left blank. It is intended to be a blank page. Pay technicians at the West Virginia USPFO attempted to help take care of some of the National Guard soldiers’ pay problems. They were told by personnel at DFAS-Indianapolis not to get involved because the active Army finance offices had primary responsibility for correcting the unit’s pay issues. Eventually, the sergeant was ordered to travel to the finance office at Camp Doha, Kuwait, to get its assistance. As illustrated in the following map, a soldier had to set aside his in-theatre duties to attempt to fix the problems. The sergeant left Uzbekistan for the 4-day trip to Kuwait. He first flew from Uzbekistan to Oman in a C-130 ambulatory aircraft (carrying wounded soldiers) From Oman, he flew to Masirah Island. From Masira Island, he had a 45-minute drive to Camp Doha. At Camp D Qatar, a reserve pay finance unit was sent from the U.S. to deal with the reserve component soldiers’ pay issues. The sergeant then flew back to Uzbekistan. The sergeant delivered a box of supporting documents used to input data into the system. He worked with the finance office personnel at Camp Doha to enter the pertinent data on each member of his battalion into DJMS-RC. The total travel time was 16 hours. On his flight between Oman and Uzbekistan, the sergeant’s plane took enemy fire and was forced to return to Oman. No injuries were reported. The next day, he left the Kuwait International Airport and flew to Camp Snoopy in Qatar. Oman and returned safely to Uzbekistan. While guidance that permits both Army Guard and active Army military pay personnel to enter transactions for mobilized Army Guard soldiers provides flexibility in serving the soldiers, we found indications that it also contributed to soldiers being passed between the active Army and Army Guard servicing locations. For example, at another of our case study locations, we were told that several mobilized soldiers sought help in resolving active duty pay problems from theactive Army’s mobilization station finance office at Fort Knox. active Army locations directed the soldiers back to the USPFO. Army Regulation 135-381 provides that Army Guard soldiers who are incapacited as a result of injury, illness, or disease that occured while on active duty for more than 30 consecutive days are eligible for continued health benefits. With medical extension status, soldiers are entitled to continue to receive active duty pays, allowances, and medical benefits while under a physician’s care. We also found procedures were not clear on how to ensure timely processing of active duty medical extensions. Four soldiers were eligible for continued active duty pay and associated medical benefits due to their involvement in Operation Enduring Freedom. Although these injuries precluded them from resuming their civilian jobs, they experienced significant pay problems as well as problems in receiving needed medical care. All four soldiers experienced pay disruptions because existing guidance was not clear on actions needed to ensure that these injuries were treated properly. The soldiers' pay problems were a result of the lack of clearly defined implementing procedures in this area, the authors say. soldiers were retained on active duty medical extensions. One of the soldiers told us, “People did not know who was responsible for what. No one knew who to contact or what paperwork was needed….” As a result, all four have experienced gaps in receiving active duty pay and associated medical benefits while they remained under a physician’s care for injuries received while on their original active duty tour. Four soldiers who were injured while mobilized in Afghanistan for Operation Enduring Freedom told us that customer service was poor and no one knew what to do. one was really looking after their interest or even cared about them. These problems resulted in numerous personal and financial difficulties for these soldiers. “Not having this resolved means that my family has had to make greater sacrifices and it leaves them in an unstable environment. This has caused great stress on my family that may lead to divorce.” “My orders ran out while awaiting surgery and the care center tried to deny me care. My savings account was reduced to nearly 0 because I was also not getting paid while I waited” at Walter Reed and my congressman. My orders were finally cut. In the end, I was discharged 2 weeks before my care should have been completed because the second amendment to my orders never came. The whole mess was blamed on the ‘state’ and nothing was ever done to fix it.” One sergeant was required to stay at Womack, the medical facility at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, while on medical extension. His home was in New Jersey. He had not been home for about 20. months, since his call to active duty. While he was recovering from his injuries, his wife was experiencing a high-risk pregnancy and depended upon her husband’s medical coverage. Even though she lived in New Jersey, she scheduled her medical appointments near Fort Bragg to be with her husband. The sergeant submitted multiple requests to extend his active duty medical extension status because the paperwork kept getting lost. Lapses in obtaining approvals for continued active dutyMedical extension status caused the sergeant’S military medical benefits and his activeduty pay to be cut. be stopped several times. He told us that because of gaps in his medical extension orders, he was denied medical coverage, resulting in three delays in scheduling a surgery. He also told us he received medical bills associated with his wife’s hospitalization for the delivery of their premature baby as a result of these gaps in coverage. We found several instances in which existing DOD and Army regulations and guidance in the pay and allowance area are outdated and conflict with more current legislative and DOD guidance. Some existing guidance reflected pay policies and procedures dating back to Operations Desert. Having out-of-date requirements in current regulations may contribute to confusion and customer service issues. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 replaced the basic allowance for quarters and the variable housing allowance. However, volume 7A, chapter 27 of the DOD FMR, dated February 2002, still refers to the basic Allowance for Quarters and variable Housing Allowance. For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or see www.samaritans.org. the variable housing allowance. The act also replaced foreign duty pay with hardship duty pay. Yet, chapter 8 of Army Regulation 37-104-4 (Military Pay and Allowances Policy and Procedures – Active Component) still refers to foreign dutypay. Further, current DFAS and Army mobilization procedural guidance directs active Army finance units to use transaction codes to start soldiers’ hardship duty pays that are incorrect. However, DOD amended FMR, Volume 7A, chapter 17, to establish a new “designated area” hardshipduty pay with rates of $50, $100, or $150 per month, depending on the area. December 19, 2002, directed mobilization site finance offices to use transaction codes that resulted in soldiers receiving a prior type of hardship duty pay that was eliminated in the December 2001 revisions. 91 of 100 Mississippi military police unit soldiers deployed to Cuba to guard al Qaeda prisoners were paid incorrect amounts. Army Regulation 37-104-4, dated September 1994, was still in effect at the end of our case study locations. We found that because the active Army finance office followed the outdated DFAS guidance for starting hardship duty pays. audit work, provides that mobilized Army Guard soldiers are to be paid through the active Army pay system. This procedure, in effect during the mobilizations to support Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, was changed in 1995. In 1995, it was agreed that Army Guard personnel would no longer be moved to the active duty pay system, DJMS-AC, when mobilized to active duty. Lacking sufficient numbers of well-trained, competent military pay professionals can undermine the effectiveness of even a world-class integrated pay and personnel system. There are no DOD or Army requirements for military pay personnel to receive training on pay entitlements and processing requirements associated with mobilized Army Guard soldiers. Pay technicians did not understand how to properly code data on the soldiers’ dependents status, which is used to determine housing allowances. Army Guard offers training for their military pay technicians, but we found that there was no overall monitoring of Army Guard pay personnel training. The lack of training on the importance of pay on the unit commander may have contributed to the problems we identified. DJMS-RC does not contain edit checks to reject payments over the threshold amounts or to require review and approval of payments over these amounts prior to their final processing. For example, at one of the case study units we audited, one soldier received an erroneous electronic payment totaling $20,110 without prior approval. In addition, our analysis showed 76 other payroll-related payments did not have edit checks for review or approval prior to final processing in DJMS- RC. For more information, visit the Department of Defense’s website. during the period October 1, 2001, through March 31, 2003, of over $7,000 (net) each that were paid by DJMS-RC. The Electronic Fund Transfer Excess Dollar Listing is printed after the payment is made. timely detection of errors is critical to help ensure that erroneous payments are recovered and that fraud does not occur. The system does not have system edits to prevent large debts from being assessed without review and approval prior to being processed. Our case studies identified individuals who received debt notices in excess of $30,000. At five of the 6 units audited, we identified 86 individuals who had total pay and allowance debts of approximately $300,000 as of March 31, 2003. A sergeant with the Colorado Army National Guard, Special Forces, encountered numerous severe pay problems associated with his mobilization to active duty. The sergeant’s active duty pay and other pay and allowances should have been stopped on December 4, 2002. However, when he was released from active duty, he was paid with no explanation. The sergeant’s mobilization orders called him to active duty for 730 days and not the 365 days that he was actually mobilized. The Army area servicing finance office at the demobilization station, Fort Campbell, did not enter the release from active duty date into DJMS-RC. The sergeant continued to improperly receive payments, as if he were still on active duty, for 2 and a half months totaling over $8,000. He was one of 34 soldiers in the company whose pay continued after their release. In February 2003, pay personnel at the Colorado USPFO created a transaction to cancel the tour instead of processing an adjustment to amend the stop date consistent with the date on the Release from Active Duty Order. When this occurred, DJMS-RC automatically processed a reversal of 11 months of the sergeant’s pay and allowances that he earned while mobilized from March 1, 2002, through February 4, 2003. This created a debt in the amount of $39,699 on the soldier's pay record. In May 2003, DFAS-Indianapolis erroneously processed a payment transaction instead of a debt correction transaction in DJMS-RC. This created a payment of $20,111, which was electronically deposited to the sergeant’s bank account without explanation. A debt of $30,454 still appeared on his Leave and Earnings Statement. About 9 months after his demobilization, the sergeant's unpaid debt balance was reportedly $26,559, but the actual amount of his debt had not yet been determined. as of September 2003. Under current procedures, if a soldier is determined to owe the government money while on active duty, he is assessed a debt and informed of this assessment with a notation of an “Unpaid Debt Balance” in the remarks section of his Leave and Earnings Statement. A soldier at one of our case study units told us that he was not notified in advance of his receipt of his leave and earnings statement that he had a large debt. In addition, we found that current procedures used to notify soldiers of large payroll-related debts did not facilitate customer service. debt assessment and that two- thirds of his pay would be garnished. As a result, he was not able to plan his financial affairs to avoid late payments on his car and other loans. This debt assessment notification procedure is even more egregious when debts, particularly large debts, are assessed in error. For example, at our case study units, we found that the only notice several soldiers received when they were erroneously assessed payroll debts was an “Unpaid Debt Balance” buried in the pay stub. The DOD has a major system enhancement effort under way in this area. The Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System (DIMHRS) is ultimately intended to replace more than 80 legacy systems. DIMH RS is described as the largest personnel and pay system in the world in both scope and number of people served. One of the major benefits expected is “service members receiving accurate and timely pay and benefits.” A $39,489.28 debt is shown in figure 8 of their Leave and Earnings Statements. functions across the department by 2007. In 2002, DOD estimated that integrated personnel and pay functions of DIMHRS would be fully deployed by fiscal year 2007. By the end of fiscal year 2003, DOD reporting shows that it will have invested over 5 years and about $360 million in conceptualizing and planning the system. However, our review of the fiscal year 2004 DOD Information Technology budget request shows that DOD is requesting $122 million and $95 million, respectively, for fiscal years 2004 and 2005. The original DIMHRS project completion milestone date has slipped about 15 months. Of the 152 soldiers mobilized in this unit, 54 soldiers were either overpaid, underpaid, or received entitled active duty pays and allowances over 30 days late. The personal toll that these pay problems have had on mobilized soldiers and their families cannot be readily measured, but clearly may have a profound effect on reenlistment and retention. The need for such actions is increasingly imperative in light of the current extended deployment of Army Guard soldiers. pay and allowance entitlements throughout their active duty mobilizations. Identify and evaluate options for improving customer service provided to mobilized Army Guard soldiers.

As part of the effort currently under way to reform DOD’s pay and personnel systems—referred to as DIMHRS—incorporate a complete understanding of the Army Guard pay problems as documented in this report into the requirements development for this system. In developing D IMHRS, consider the need for an Army Guard edit check. a complete reengineering of the processes and controls and ensure that this reengineering effort deals not only with the systems aspect of the problems we identified, but also with the human capital and process aspects. In its written comments, DOD concurred with our recommendations and identified actions to address the identified deficiencies. DOD’s response outlined some actions already taken, others that are underway, and further planned actions with respect to our recommendations. If effectively implemented, these actions should substantially resolve the deficiencies pointed out in our report. unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its date. At that time, we will send copies of the report to interested congressional committees. We will make copies available to others upon request.

The Colorado Army National Guard’s B Company, 5th Battalion, 19th Special Forces, was mobilized to active duty on orders for a 2-year period. The unit was mobilized at Fort Knox and subsequently deployed in Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and surrounding areas to search for Taliban and al Qaeda terrorists as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. No charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions regarding this report, please contact me at (202) 512-9505. returned to Fort Campbell for demobilization and was released from active duty on December 4, 2002. The majority of soldiers from Colorado’s B Company experienced some sort of pay problem during one or more of the three phases of their active duty mobilization. Overall, all 62 soldiers with the company had at least one pay problem associated with their mobilization. These pay problems included not receiving pay or not being paid at the end of the mobilization. A timeline of the unit's actions associated to its mobilization under Operation Enduring Freedom is shown in figure 9. 56 soldiers did not receive certain pay and allowance entitlements at all, or within 30 days of their initial mobilization. 61 soldiers either didn't receive the hostile fire pay or other “high-risk location” pays they were entitled to receive based on their deployment in Uzbekistan and Afghanistan. 53 soldiers either improperly continued to receive hostile firepay after leaving high-risk locations. For some, overpayments of pays and allowances were found, as well as improper pay and allowances payments. overseas or continued to receive paychecks, as if they were still on active duty status, for over 2 months beyond their release from active duty. In total, we identified estimated overpayments of $494,000, underpayments, and late payments of $64,000. In addition, in trying to correct over payments associated with Colorado B Company’s departure from high-risk locations, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) billed 34 of the soldiers. the unit’s soldiers an average of $48,000 each, for a largely erroneous total debt of over $1.6 million. Many soldiers with the company characterized the service they received from the state United States Property and Fiscal Office (USPFO) and the active Army finance offices as “poor’ or “openly hostile” Some of the soldiers in the unit expressed significant dissatisfaction with the time and effort they, or their spouses were required to spend attempting to identify and correct their pay. special forces soldiers to address pay problems, in some cases, distracted them from important mission operations. In addition, several soldiers told us that the numerous pay problems they encountered would play a major role in their decision whether to reenlist. According to several soldiers from Colorado’s B Company, the combined effect of recurring pay problems adversely affects morale and may have an adverse effect on a soldier's willingness to continue his military career. The soldiers also reported receiving poor payroll customer service during their active duty tours. 56 out of 62 soldiers did not receive certain pays and allowances at all, or in a timely manner, after being activated on December 5, 2001. The underpayments and late payments resulted in adverse financial repercussions for a number of the unit’s members and their families. For example, 16 of the 62 soldiers in B Company received the wrong type of hardship duty pay, formerly called Foreign Duty Pay, in addition to the correct hardship duty location pay while they were deployed in Afghanistan. 39 of the unit’s 62 soldiers continued to receive active duty pay and allowances, some until February 14, 2003. The unit received orders to demobilize at Fort Campbell rather than Fort Knox where they originally mobilized. As a result, 34 soldiers received notice on their Leave and Earnings Statements that they owed debts for the 11 months of their active duty tour—an average of $48,000 per soldier, for a total debt of $1.6 million. We were told that it would take approximately 4 to 5 years for the soldiers to pay off these debts. administrator stated that many of these soldiers received amended orders after their initial mobilization when it was determined that they were not deployable for a variety of reasons, such as health or family problems. The overpayments occurred because the Maryland Army Guard command was not informed by either unit personnel or the active component that individuals (1) did not deploy or (2) were released from active duty early. The Maryland Army Guards command initiated amendment orders to stop the active duty pays when it became aware of the problem. The orders were not generated in time for the USPFO to stop active duty pay in the system. account, we determined that he continued to receive active duty pay and allowances for an entire year. The unit administrator and Maryland Army Guard command, along with the USPFO pay officials, were not sure why the amendment order was never processed. They believe that the amendment fell through the cracks due to the general confusion and the limited personnel processing the mass mobilizations after September 11, 2001. The soldier mobilized with the unit and was deployed for the entire year that he was paid, the unit administrator said. 42 soldiers from the unit were underpaid their entitled family separation allowance when they mobilized. The underpayments occurred as a result of Maryland USPFO military pay officials’ errors in calculating the start and stop dates for this allowance. Several soldiers did not receive the correct type of basic training. The Army Guard command generated an amendment on August 21, 2003, to reinstate the original order to avoid future questions regarding the soldier’s tour of duty. The amendment was passed by the Maryland Army Guard Command and signed into law on August 22, 2003. allowance for housing after being mobilized as specified in the DOD FMR, Volume 7A, chapter 26. We were unable to determine specific causes and amounts of all the unit’s problems associated with the basic allowance for housing because the unit had remobilized in July 2003. Some of the historical records relating to housing entitlements applicable to the prior mobilization could not be located. Based on our inquiries, we determined that some soldiers were underpaid their housing allowance because the Maryland unit had been mobilized in 2003. USPFO military pay officials entered the incorrect date for the tour and therefore shortened the unit’s soldiers’ allowance by 1 day. Other soldiers did not receive the correct amount for this allowance as a result of different interpretations of how to enter “dependent” information provided on housing allowance application forms. According to personnel officials, married soldiers are required to write in their spouses’ names as dependents on Form 5960 in order to receive the higher housing allowance amount. However, guidance did not clearly specify that simply checking the box indicating that they are married is not sufficient support. to receive the higher housing allowance (with dependents) rate. As a result, several soldiers’ dependent information was not loaded into the personnel system correctly, and they were paid a single rate housing allowance instead of the higher married rate allowance. Other soldiers did not receive the correct housing allowance because they did not turn in complete forms and documentation to initiate the correct allowance rate or were late in turning in documents. For example, one soldier, who appeared to have submitted his lease agreement 6 days after being called to active duty, did not receiving the correcthousing allowance amount. for the first 2 months of active duty. As of March 30, 2003, the soldier had not received the correct housing allowance for October and November 2001. Another soldier did not receive the correct amount of housing allowance after his mobilization and complained to the unit administrator. Seven months after his initial mobilization to active duty, finance officials agreed to pay the soldier back pay for his housing allowance underpayments. For confidential support, call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or see www.samaritans.org. Finance officials at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, inadvertently entered a transaction to collect the entire amount of the housing allowance previously paid to the soldier. Sixty-two soldiers from the unit were overpaid their entitled subsistence allowance by active duty officials. As summarized in table 22, we identified a number of pay problems associated with five different types of active duty pays and allowances associated with the unit’s deployment. The problems were resolved by paying the soldier a “catch-up” housing allowance payment. Army finance personnel while stationed at the Pentagon during the period of December 15, 2001, through December 31, 2001. Prior to this period, the soldiers were stationed at Fort Stewart and were not provided lodging or mess. When the unit was redeployed to the Pentagon, mess facilities became available. However, active Army finance personnel did not reduce the unit’s subsistence allowance rate to reflect the available mess facilities. According to DOD FMR, Volume 7A, chapter 25, enlisted soldiers are not entitled to the full subsistence allowance when mess facilities are provided. Soldiers who perform duties in “designated areas” for over 30 days are entitled to hardship duty pay. The FMR specifies Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as a designated area and provides payment of $50 a month to soldiers serving there. The soldiers were either underpaid, or were late in receiving their entitled hardship duty pays. In accordance with DOD FMR Volume 7A, chapter 17, the soldiers were paid $50 per month for 30 days in Guantanamo Bay. In 2002, three soldiers who received mobilization orders left Fort Stewart and traveled with the 115th Military Police Company to Guantanamo. While deployed to Cuba, the three soldiers were mistakenly paid the old type of hardship duty pay. The 200th Military Police Company returned to Fort Eustis around the end of August 2002 to begin the demobilization process. The soldiers did not receive all their entitled hardship duty pays. Furthermore, the hardshipduty pays they did receive were more than 30 days late. We are happy to clarify that this was not the case and that the soldiers were paid as part of the Army’s regular hardship pay program. did not identify any pay issues associated with the unit’s soldiers who were released from active duty on September 30, 2002. However, as shown in table 23, we did identify three soldiers who continued to receive active duty pay after their early release. Specifically, the three soldiers from the unit returned from Cuba, demobilized at Fort Stewart, and were released on July 10, 2002, while their original orders showed a September 30,. 2002, release date. They continued to receiving active duty Pay. The 49th Military Police Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment (HHD) was mobilized to active duty for a period not to exceed 24 months. The unit performed its active duty mission at Fort Lewis, where it provided base security as part of the military police force. The 49th MP HHD mobilized at its home station, Pittsburg, California, and then proceeded to its designated mobilization station, Fort Lewis on October 12, 2001. Fort Stewart did not provide the amended orders with the earlier release date in time to stop the pay.and allowances through July 15, 2002. of Operation Noble Eagle. The unit was demobilized from active duty at Fort Lewis on July 28, 2002. Almost all soldiers from the 49th Military Police Company experienced some sort of pay problem during one or more phases of the active duty mobilization. Overall, 50 of the 51 soldiers with the unit had at least one pay problem associated with their mobilization to active duty in support of Operation Noble Eagles. These pay problems included pay problems with food, shelter, medical care, and other benefits. not receiving pays and allowances at all (underpayments), receiving some pays and allowance over 30 days after entitlement (late payments), and the overpayment of allowances. 48 soldiers did not receive certain pay and allowances within 30 days of their initial mobilization entitlement. In total, we identified estimated overpayments of $17,000, underpayment of $1,300, and late payments of $67,000 associated with the pay problems we found. We found that 41 soldiers didn't receive the pay and allowance they were entitled to receive. Of the $17,000 in overpayments, we found that less than $100 was subsequently collected from the soldiers. We found a lack of sufficient numbers of knowledgeable staff. In addition, after-the- fact detective controls were not in place, including a reconciliation of pay and personnel records. Currently, as a matter of practice, pay and. personnel representatives from the USPFO conduct a manual reconciliation between the pay. and personnel system records. approximately every every year. The U.S. Navy is the largest military service in the world. The USPFO does not have the resources required to carry out such reconciliations each month. The purpose of the reconciliation is to ensure that for common data elements, the pay and personnel systems contain the same data. As summarized in table 25, we identified a number of pay problems associated with the unit’s mobilization to active duty. Failures to enter transactions or late entry of transactions needed to start active duty pays by Army GuardUSPFO military pay personnel and by active Army. military pay personnel at the unit’s mobilization station were the initial cause of the pay problems. In total, 48 out of 51 soldiers of the 49th Military Police Company did not receive certain pay and allowances and incentive pays at all, or not at all. Neither organization was prepared for the sheer volume of pay transactions associated with mobilizing soldiers to active duty, according to Army Guard and active Army officials. In addition, the California USPFO and the Fort Lewis Finance Office did not have sufficient numbers of knowledgeable personnel. did not receive them within 30 days after being mobilized on October 2, 2001. The types of pay entitlements either not paid at all or paid late associated with the unit’s initial mobilization included basic pay, basic allowance for subsistence, and family separation allowance. According to DFAS reserve component mobilization procedures; the California USPFO was responsible for initiating these pays. However, a late payments during the mobilization phase primarily resulted from military pay personnel's lack of understanding of their responsibility for initiating active duty pays. USPFO military pay official mistakenly instructed the unit to take its pay data to the mobilization station to enter transactions to start active duty pays. The USPFO did not start the active duty pay and allowances at that time because a copy machine was not available to make copies. As a result, the responsibility for initiating this allowance was improperly passed to the active Army finance office at the Fort Lewis mobilization station. The Fort Lewis finance office has since apologized for the mistake. The U.S. Army says it is investigating the incident. Finance office lacked sufficient numbers of knowledgeable military pay staff to expeditiously enter the large volume of transactions necessary to start active duty pay entitlements. One of the assigned pay technicians was not familiar with DJMS-RC and consequently entered data incorrectly for some of the unit’s soldiers. The company commander for the unit told us that he was frustrated with the level of customer support his unit received as it moved through the initial mobilization process. Late, under- and over-payments of foreign language proficiency to the 49th Military Police Company's soldiers primarily resulted from inadequate data entry. allowances for mobilized Army Guard soldiers during the period from October 1, 2001, through March 31, 2003, that were in excess of (overpayment) or less than (underpayment) the entitled payment. We considered as late payments any active duty pays or allowances paid to the soldier over 30 days after the date on which the soldier was entitled to receive such pays and allowances. We provided the support for the pay problems we identified to appropriate officials, at each of our case study locations so that they could fully develop and resolve any additional amounts owed. will prepare a standard information flyer to be given to all mobilizing reservists. The flyer will address entitlements as well as sources of pay support. The existing centralized information sources on individual soldiers pay will be expanded. The Army and DFAS will continue to work the correction of any specific cases identified as still open for these units. The National Guard Financial Services Center is working with each of the identified units and supporting USPFOs to ensure all pay issues are resolved. High altitude, low opening jump pay is scheduled for implementation for April 2004.

Summary:
Section 808 of the NDAA for fiscal year 2012 limited DOD’s total obligations for contract services in fiscal years 2012 through 2014. The limit does not apply to contract services for military construction, research and development, and services funded for overseas contingency operations. The spending limit identified in the act applies to DOD in its entirety, so individual components may exceed their individual targets. Congress has also enacted legislation to improve the availability of information on DOD”s acquisition of services, the authors say. 2014, as each command was able to manage to their respective target. In fiscal year 2014, the Army obligated $254 million more than its adjusted Comptroller target. Army budget officials attributed a portion of the obligations over its target to coding errors in its financial system. These coding errors include obligations for contract services from overseas contingency operations that are not subject to the spending limit but were inadvertently included in the Army’s submission to the Comptroller”s office. The Army took additional steps to manage and monitor the contract services spending limit for fiscal year 2013 and 2014. Navy FMC officials identified two factors that led to the Navy exceeding its target. The Navy FMC office identified an additional $400 million in contract services needed for unanticipated costs. The Comptroller’s office approved a waiver request in June 2014 for $263 million in additional ship maintenance costs, which was approved by the Comptroller's office. Despite the increase in the Navy”s target amount, Navy officials identified a number of other factors that caused the Navy to exceed its target amount. costs, but did not submit a waiver request to the Comptroller since the fiscal year was ending. To mitigate this issue for fiscal year 2015, the Navy FMC office began monthly monitoring of contract services obligations. Second, Navy F MC officials attributed the remaining $600 million of the $1.07 billion it obligated over its target to a coding error in its financial system. Specifically, NavyFMC officials said the financial system does not allow for the payment of overage payments at mid-year and end-of-year execution reviews. Navy financial management officials said they manually corrected these coding errors in the past, but decided to forego the manual corrections in fiscal year 2014. The Navy FMC office requested updates to its financial system in August 2013 to correct this coding issue, but the change has not yet been approved. To make progress payments for these types of items, Navy officials explained that these payments are coded as contract services to work around the system limitation. The change is expected to be approved in fiscalyear 2016.  NDAA for fiscal year 2015 encouraged DOD to use different data sources, such as advisory and assistance services, to measure compliance. This new measure was adopted after a lack of data hindered DOD’s previous attempts to demonstrate compliance. All of the military departments achieved funding reductions greater than 20 percent for closely associated with inherently governmental and staff augmentation functions by fiscal year 2014, according to an analysis of DOD obligation data.or implemented. As we reported in December 2014, the advisory and Assistance services budget category is not an exact measurement of closely associated. with inherently government functions. However, it may be the best currently available data source to determine reductions. The Air Force and Navy achieved reductions in advisory and assistance service obligations greater than 30 percent from fiscal years 2010 through 2013. The Army achieved a 9 percent reduction by fiscal year 2013, but achieved a 32 percent reduction in fiscal year 2014. The DOD Comptroller intends to measure a 30 percent reduction from 2010 levels based on former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates’ Efficiencies Initiative which called for DOD to reduce service support contractors by 10 percent each year from fiscal year 2011 through 2013, for a total of 30 percent.

Summary:
AmeriCorps*USA is the largest national and community service program since the Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930s. Participants earn education awards to help pay for postsecondary education in exchange for performing community service that matches priorities established by the Corporation. A minimum of 1,700 hours of service within a year is required to earn the full $4,725 award. The Corporation requires that programs devote some portion of the award to community service. The award is for full-time service or half of that amount for part- time service. but no more than 20 percent, of participants’ service hours to nondirect service activities, such as training or studying for the equivalent of a high school diploma. To earn a part-time award, a participant must perform 900 hours of community service within 2 years. Individuals can serve more than two terms; however, they can only receive two education awards. The awards, which are held in trust by the U.S. Treasury, are paid directly to qualified postsecondary institutions or student loan lenders. AmeriCorps*USA participants receive a living allowance stipend that is at least equal to, but no more than double, the average annual living allowance received by Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) participants. Additional benefits include health insurance and child care assistance for participants who need them. Individuals can join a national service program before, during, or after postsecondary education. A participant must be a citizen, a national, or a lawful permanent resident of the United States.  Selection of participants is not based on financial need. Corporation used about $149 million of its fiscal year 1994 appropriations to make about 300 grants to nonprofit organizations and federal, state, and local government agencies to operate AmeriCorps*USA programs. Grant recipients use grant funds to pay up to 85 percent of the cost of participants’ living allowances and benefits (up to 100 percent of child care expenses) and up to 75 percent of a participant’s living expenses. Program participants must be high school graduate or agree to earn the equivalent of a high school diploma before receiving an education award. of other program costs, including participant training, education, and uniforms. Staff salaries, travel, transportation, supplies, and equipment; and program evaluation and administrative costs. If participants leave the program during the year, the Corporation may either allow the program to redirect participant stipend and benefit funds to other program expenses or take back any unused portion of the grant. To ensure that federal Corporation dollars are used to leverage other resources for program support, grantees must also obtain support from non-Corporation sources. to help pay for the program. This support, which can be cash or in-kind contributions, may come from other federal sources as well as state and local governments, and private sources. Some federal agencies received grants during the initial 2 program years to support AmeriCorps*USA participants who performed work furthering the agencies’ missions. Federal agency grantees could use their own resources in the Ameri corps program to help fund the service projects that are part of their missions. addition to the Corporation grant to integrate national service more fully into their mission work. the smallest share of resources, amounting to about 12 percent (or about $41 million) Most of the Corporation’s funding for AmeriCorps*USA projects went to providing operating grants and education awards. About 69 percent of all matching resources came from either a federal or private source. The remainder went toward Corporation program management and administration. The Corporation is a non-profit organization based in Washington, D.C. a state or local government source, with the split between cash and in-kind contributions being about 43 percent. The remaining 31 percent of matching resources were from private sources. In calculating resources available on a per-participant and per-service-hour basis (see table 1), we found that the average from all sources per AmeriCorps*USA participant was about $26,654. This amounted to about $16 per service hour or about $18 million for a total of $57 million. about $20 per direct service hour, assuming 20 percent of the 1,700 hours of total service was nondirect service time. Because most AmeriCorps*USA programs were still implementing their first year of operations, actual cost could not be determined. We calculated available resources per participant on a full-time-equivalent (FTE) basis. It is important not to equate our funding information with cost data. These figures represent resources available for all program expenses and are not the equivalent of annual salaries or hourly wages for participants. in-kind contributions from sources other than the Corporation were reported to us in May 1995 as resources already received or those that program directors were certain of receiving by the end of their current operating year. Non-Corporation federal funds accounted for about 50 percent of total resources available to federal grantees. Nonfederal AmeriCorps*USA grantees received resources of less than $800. The federal agency grantees had about $15,500 in cash and in- Kind contributions available per participant. per participant from non-Corporation federal sources, or about 3 percent of their total resources. The appendix contains more detailed program resource information by sponsoring agency. AmeriCorps*USA has also sponsored an evaluation of its own that summarized results at a sample of programs during their first 5 months of operation. The evaluation identified diverse achievements related to each service area. Participants renovating inner-city housing, assisting in the construction of new homes, and helping with other community service projects. They also helped with community clean-ups and clean-up efforts. AmeriCorps’s legislation identified renewing the spirit of community as an objective. We observed several projects focused on rebuilding communities. For example, a multifamily house being renovated was formerly a congregating spot for drug dealers. Program officials believe that after completion, it will encourage other neighborhood improvements. Another project was maintaining and reestablishing native vegetation in a flood control area, analyzing neighborhood crime statistics to better target prevention measures, and developing a program in a community food bank for people with special dietary needs. Team built a community farm market and renovated a municipal stadium. Participants of several programs spanned a wide age range, from teenagers to retirees. Teams also showed diversity in educational, economic, and ethnic backgrounds. Participants said that a valuable aspect of the program was working with others with different backgrounds and benefiting from their strengths. Another of AmeriCorps*USA’s program objectives was to foster civic responsibility. The program is funded by the federal government. For more information on the Americorps* USA program, visit www.corps-usa.org. We saw evidence of this at programs such as one where participants devoted half of each Friday to working on community service projects. Participants at another program, in which they organized meetings to establish relationships between at-risk youth and elderly people, commented that this work had taught them how to organize programs. Training periods included conflict resolution techniques and team-building skills. At the sites we visited, participants indicated that the education award was an important part of the program. education or job training. We hope to see more of these programs in the future. of their decision to participate in AmeriCorps*USA. Programs also supported participants in obtaining high school diplomas or the equivalent. According to Corporation regulations, a full-time participant who does not have a high school diploma or its equivalent generally must agree to earn one or the other before using the education award. In one program, a general equivalency diploma (GED) candidate was receiving classroom instruction and individual tutoring. She had recently passed the preliminary GED test after failing the Ged test five times. larger program that recruited at-risk youth, most of whom do not have high school diplomas. Program officials said most of the participants are enrolled in high school equivalency courses. We also saw programs that offer participants the chance to get postsecondary academic credit. One such program, affiliated with a private college, offered participants the option of pursuing an environmental studies curriculum through which they can earn up to six upper-level credits at a college. The program is free and available to the public. reduced tuition. Half of the participants have chosen to do so. A second program allowed participants to earn 36 credit hours toward an associate’s degree in the natural sciences through their service, which can lead to state certification as an environmental restoration technician. On the legislative side, the Congress mandated new funding restrictions for the Corporation. The Corporation, after consulting with Members of Congress, has revised its grant guidelines. These new measures will only apply to AmeriCorps members who have completed their service. affect programs receiving grants for the upcoming 1996-97 program year. federal agencies ineligible to receive AmeriCorps grants. The law also requires that to the maximum extent possible, the Corporation (1) increase the amount of matching contributions provided by the private sector and (2) reduce the total federal cost per participant in Ameri corps programs. We expect to complete our study by the end of this fiscal year. In recent months, the corporation has worked with Members of Congress to identify ways to improve the program. The Corporation has revised its grant application guidelines for programs receiving funding in the upcoming 1996-97 program year. In response to congressional concerns over the cost of mandating the purchase and use of uniforms, the AmeriCorps*USA uniform package is no longer a program requirement. The Corporation also has directed grantees exceeding a program year 1995-96 cost per participant of $13,800 to reduce their proposed program year 1996-96 per-participant costs by an overall average of 10 percent. program operating costs from 25 to 33 percent for grants awarded for the 1996-97 program year. The Corporation’s revised grant guidelines also seek to reduce costs by encouraging a program requesting increased funding to add additional participants, thereby reducing its cost per participant. The guidelines also encourage programs to seek additional funding only for education awards. It means cash and in-kind contributions that pay participants’ living allowances, social security taxes, health insurance, child care, and the education awards they earn in exchange for their service. pay local program staff who manage operations and supervise staff; to pay rent for office space and purchase supplies. To pay for travel and transportation for program staff and participants; and to pay for materials needed to conduct national service projects. It means resources available for planning grants used to design and formalize future national service programs. And it means resources for the staff and operations of the Corporation for National and Community Service. The objective was not to draw conclusions about whether AmeriCorps*USA was cost-effective. Rather, it was to gather information on the total cost of the program. amount of resources available to AmeriCorps*USA programs nationwide and to provide this information by resource stream. Though not precise cost data, this information illustrated the funding levels that may be needed to support new program endeavors of similar scale in the future. It also indicated the degree of partnership between the public and private sectors. Since we completed our review, the Congress and the Corporation have undertaken a number of measures that are intended to reduce the costs of Ameri corps. Because many of these initiatives will not take effect until later this year, we are unable to give a cost estimate. the upcoming 1996-97 program year, it is too early to determine their impact.

Summary:
Security experts have raised concerns that terrorists may try to smuggle radiological or nuclear materials into the United States to produce either an RDD or IND. Sealed sources are used throughout the U.S. and are commonly called a sealed radiological source. This radioactive material is encapsulated, or sealed, in metal, such as stainless steel, titanium, or platinum, to prevent its dispersal and is commonly known as a sealed Radiological Source (RDS) or dirty bomb. The RDD is a bomb made from a mixture of nuclear and radioactive materials. other countries in equipment designed to diagnose and treat illnesses, preserve food, detect flaws in pipeline welds, and determine the moisture content of soil. Depending on their use, sealed sources contain different types of radioactive material, such as strontium- 90, cobalt-60, cesium-137, plutonium-238, and plutonium-239. While no terrorists have detonated a dirty bomb in a city, Chechen separatists placed a canister containing cesiam-137 in a Moscow park in the mid- 1990s. In contrast, detonating an IND would require a terrorist group to obtain nuclear weapons material. Another form of nuclear terrorism occurred with the dispersal of radioactive materials through a sequence of events in London during November and December 2006. On November 23, 2006, Alexander Litvinenko, a former officer of the Russian Federal Security Service, was poisoned with a milligram of polonium-210—about the size of a grain of salt. The perpetrators of that attack dispersed the poloniam by the perpetrators of the 2006 London bombings. The crime and the victim resulted in widespread contamination across London and even abroad. His poisoning was detected only after he was hospitalized for a few weeks and tested for symptoms of radiation exposure because of hair loss. Following the poisoning, forensic investigators examined 47 sites across London for traces of polonium. Of these locations, about 12 showed signs of this radioactive material, including a restaurant, hotel room, soccer stadium, and an eastbound British Airways plane. British investigators also identified over 1,000. people who might have been in various ways exposed to the polonium. Health officials tested 738 of them and found that 137 had reportable levels of this substance. Few of these individuals turned out to have levels that warranted medical attention. The decontamination activities at these sites spanned 19 days, involved a number of methods and technologies, and cost more than $200,000. The estimated total cost of managing this incident, including law enforcement investigation, testing individuals, sampling materials, and cleanup, was $4 million. incidents as evidenced by not (1) developing a national disaster recovery strategy as required by law and (2) issuing specific guidance to coordinate federal, state, and city planning to recover from RDD or IND incidents. The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 requires FEMA to develop, coordinate, and maintain disaster recovery plans. FEMA has not developed a national recovery strategy or issued specific guidance. Federal agencies have conducted few exercises to test recovery plans for these incidents, as shown in the table below. a national disaster recovery strategy. Among other things, the strategy is to clearly define the roles, programs, authorities, and responsibilities of each agency. The federal government has placed a higher priority on developing a strategy to respond to domestic incidents, including RDD and IND incidents. For example, the response strategy, captured in the 2008 National Response Framework, is focused on domestic incidents. The recovery strategy should focus on the recovery from these incidents, rather than domestic incidents as a whole, the report says. A FEMA coordinator says the agency is working on a national disaster recovery strategy. The strategy would provide guidance to federal, state, and local agencies, he says. The lack of a national recovery strategy that would include RDD and IND incidents is problematic, authors say. Most localities would count on the federal government to carry out analysis and environmental cleanup, they say. The authors say the new administration has decided to rethink the entire approach to disaster recovery. these activities should be primarily a federal responsibility, they write. FEMA has not issued specific guidance describing how federal capabilities would be integrated into and support state and local plans for recovery from RDD or IND incidents. FEMA has delayed issuing this guidance pending the reevaluation of its planning approach by the new administration. FEMA is developing regional support plans, including for RDD and IND incidents, through its regional offices. EPA indicated that as no single federal department or agency has the sole requisite technical capacity and capabilities to respond to the scope of RDD incidents, it is expected that numerous federal agencies would need to work together. There is evidence that the agencies could effectively carry out the analysis and environmental cleanup of localized areas contaminated by radioactive materials. EPA has published inventories of radiological methods and technology guidance for contaminated sites, surfaces, and media. DOD has also played a major role in studying potential applications for innovative technologies for its Superfund sites. There are limitations in federal efforts to help address, in a timely manner, the magnitude of cleanup capabilities to help with an RDD or IND incident, the authors say.  limitations in federal capabilities to complete some analysis and environmental cleanup activities might slow the recovery from an incident. For example, the current predictive capability of various plume models is not sufficient, and may never be sufficient to reduce the time necessary to fully characterize the extent of contaminated areas. EPA agreed that characterization of areas contaminated with radioactive materials from RDD or IND incidents would be challenging because existing plumemodels are not entirely applicable to urban areas. NNSA officials informed us they are working with FEMA on a multiyear program to improveFederal capabilities to model the release of material during a radiological or nuclear incident. of contaminated areas and levels of cleanup after applying decontamination approaches. FEMA’s proposed process for determining cleanup standards during the recovery phase for RDD and IND incidents has not been fully exercised. EPA has conducted an examination of federal, state, local, and private laboratory capabilities to conduct environmental sampling and testing. EPA determined that there was a significant capacity and competency gap in the nation's laboratory capacity to support environmental monitoring and decontamination of chemical, biological, and radiochemical-nuclear agents. meeting the laboratory evaluation needs for an RDD scenario. In addition, while EPA did not conduct a detailed assessment of the national planning scenario for an IND incident, it determined that such an incident could contaminate 3,000 square miles and require potentially millions of samples for laboratory analysis. According to EPA documentation, the gap in laboratory capacity would result in the lack of timely, reliable, and interpretable data. EPA has documented that it is currently establishing an all-media Environmental Response Laboratory Network. Decontamination expert: An important consideration in decontamination is the starting level of radioactivity and desired ending level. No technology removes all of the contamination all the time; some technologies are more efficient than others at removing certain kinds of contamination. The current DHS planning guidance for decontaminating urban areas is not clear on this issue, the expert says. The goal is to enhance the capacity and capability of public laboratories, says the expert, and to reduce the cost of decontamination. RDD and IND incidents recommends a framework for incident cleanup and recovery using a process called “site-specific optimization” for determining the level of environmental cleanup after RDD or IND incidents. The guidance recommends that this process include potential future land uses, technical feasibility, costs, cost-effectiveness, and public accountability. EPA informed us that draft guidance intended to outline the structure of, and responsibilities for the conduct of the optimization process as they pertain to EPA’s involvement in RDD andIND incidents is under review by the new Administrator. There are limitations in federal capabilities to help state and local governments address the interim storage and eventual disposal of the radioactive waste. A 2008 report found gaps in our nation’s capabilities to effectively remove and dispose of radioactive debris in the event of an RDD or IND incident. This is due, in part, to current technology and technology development.forward to the lessons to be learned from the upcoming Liberty RadEx exercise in 2010, which officials believe should provide significant insights into the issues under discussion. restrictions on accessing possible disposal facilities for the radioactive debris stemming from such incidents. According to NNSA officials, DOE’s disposal sites currently can only accept low-level and mixed low- level radioactive waste from its own and DOD facilities. EPA is concerned about access to commercial radioactive waste disposal sites in the event of such an incident, according to an EPA decontamination expert. Currently, there is only one low-levels radioactive waste. disposal site located in Utah that could be used by most states for radioactive debris disposal. waste disposal facilities for waste generated by users of radioactive materials in their states. Another issue is paying for waste disposal. In the Superfund program, EPA can bill the responsible party, if known. However, covering the cost of waste disposal would be complicated in the case of RDD or IND incidents. One additional complicating factor would be the mixing and problematic separation of radioactive, biological, and chemical materials in the debris that would stem from such incidents. According to a recent research paper on disposal issues, the proper characterization of the quantity, properties, and level of debris contamination and decontamination is important. Residue from an RDD or other radiological incidents can have significant impacts on cleanup costs and restoration timelines. Concerns about limitations in these federal capabilities were expressed by many city, state, and federal regional office emergency management officials who responded to our survey. Respondents from nearly all the cities and states expressed the need for a national disaster recovery strategy to address gaps and overlaps in current federal guidance in the context of a radiological incident. The EPA is currently developing a suite of decision support tools for the management of waste and debris from a variety of different events. Most cities expressed the need for greater planning interactions with the federal government. EPA and FEMA regional office emergency management officials offered a number of suggestions on ways to improve federal preparedness. The UK reported taking the following actions to prepare for recovery from RDD and IND incidents: Enacted civil protection legislation in 2004. Established generic framework for multiagency response and recovery for all levels of government. The U.S. has not yet developed a national disaster recovery strategy for RDD or IND incidents. Guidance emphasizes that response and recovery are not discrete activities and do not occur sequentially. The Government Decontamination Service provides advice and guidance to local governments, maintains and builds a framework of specialized analysis and environmental cleanup contractors. Updated the recovery handbooks for radiation incidents in 2008 and 2009. The handbooks are intended to aid decision makers in developing recovery strategies for contaminated food production systems, drinking water, and inhabited areas following the release of radioactive materials into the environment. The lessons learned from this exercise were incorporated into the United Kingdom’s recovery strategy.

Summary:
The Current Population Survey (CPS) is the primary source of information on the United States labor force. CPS provides data on where children work, the types of jobs they hold, and how many hours a week they work. In addition, it provides demographic information on children such as age, race, ethnicity, and family income. Because the data have been collected for over 50 years, they can be used to help identify working children in the U.S. The CPS is compiled monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) used to show how the number and characteristics of working children have changed over time. Labor also compiles two additional sources of nationally representative data on working children. The first is the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) The most recent NLSY began in 1997 and is referred to as ‘NLSy97’; it contains data on one group of approximately 9,000 children born from 1980 to 1984. NLSy provides detailed information on the work experiences of this group of children over time and captures data not collected in CPS. Children’s work habits, education, and personal lives. NLSY cannot be used to show how the number and characteristics of all working children have changed over time because it only includes information on one group of children born from 1980 to 1984. The second set is the National Agricultural Workers Survey in which data are collected several times each year from a sample of crop agricultural workers. This survey provides data on the number of children who work in migrant agriculture, their educational attainment, and their mobility. BLS reports all work-related fatalities, including those for children, in its Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries published each year. BLS identifies these fatalities through CPS and NLSY but it is limited. Labor added questions to the survey in fiscal year 2000 to obtain additional data on children who work in agriculture but has not been able to obtain data on a sufficiently large number of children working in crop agriculture to provide information that is statistically reliable. The primary sources of data on. children who are injured or killed as a result of work- related injuries come from BLS and NIOSH. death certificates and reports from state workers’ compensation agencies, medical examiners, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the news media. NIOSH collects data on work- related injuries in its National Electronic Injury Surveillance System from a sample of emergency room records. The employment of working children is generally covered by FLSA and its implementing regulations, which limit the types of jobs, number of children, and wages. BLS collects data from a survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses from a sampling of the injury records employers in private industry are required to maintain. hours, and times of day that children younger than 16 years of age can work. Children who are 14 and 15 years old may work in many jobs in retail stores, restaurants, and gas stations. They may not, however, work in any job considered hazardous, including jobs in manufacturing, mining, construction, transportation, warehousing, communications, and public utilities. The provisions also prohibit 14- and 15-year-olds from working during school hours and limit the number of hours they can work at a job.  FLSA authorizes the Secretary of Labor to designate certain types of jobs and equipment as too hazardous for children under the age of 18. Once children reach age 16, they are only prohibited from working in jobs or with equipment covered by these Hazardous Occupations Orders. For jobs in agriculture, the child labor provisions are much less restrictive. Children of any age may work an unlimited number of hours (outside of school hours) in nonhazardous jobs, either on a farm owned by their parents or on a noncommercial farm with written consent of their parents. employers whose annual gross volume of sales is less than $500,000 and whose work cannot be linked to interstate commerce are not covered under FLSA. In addition, children who are self-employed are not subject to the child labor provisions of FLSA, although they may be covered under state child labor laws. Children who work for their parents are prohibited from working in occupations and operating equipment listed in the Hazardous Occupations Orders. When children reach age 18, they are no longer covered under the Child Labor Act. In 2001, several legislative proposals were submitted in the House of Representatives and the Senate that would strengthen the child labor provisions of FLSA. The proposals include the Children’s Act for Responsible Employment of 2001, which would increase the maximum penalties for child labor violations and prohibit children aged 16 and 17 from working in hazardous occupations in agriculture. The Young American Workers’ Bill of Rights would amend the FLSA to require employers to obtain work permits for all children age 18 and under who are still in school. data on child labor from the states, including data on injuries and illnesses, and add additional restrictions. (See app. II for a list of the legislative proposals introduced in the 107th Congress that would strengthen the child labor provisions of FLSA.) Labor’s Wage and Hour Division (WHD) is responsible for enforcing the child labour provisions ofFLSA. WHD’S national office develops the goals and performance measures for Labor's child labor compliance efforts and reports on the results of its efforts in annual performance plans. is also responsible for providing guidance and training to WHD’s regional and district offices and for assessing the results of their child labor compliance efforts. Much of the responsibility for planning and executing these efforts is left to the discretion of WHD's five regional offices and the 50 district offices that report directly to the regions. The Child Labor Team Leader in the headquarters office is responsible for coordinating WHD ‘s child labor Compliance efforts, including disseminating information and guidance to the regional andDistrict offices.  WHD’s child labor compliance efforts comprise several strategies: enforcement, partnerships, education and outreach, and public awareness. Education and outreach activities are specifically targeted to groups that can have an impact on youth employment, such as teachers, parents, and employers. Its public awareness strategy is designed to inform the general public about the child labor provisions of FLSA through activities such as press releases. The Field Operations Handbook for investigators, and overseeing special projects, is available on WHD's website. of children under age 18, and maintaining a Web site with information on the child labor provisions of FLSA and state child labor laws. WHD’s enforcement actions include on-site investigations of employers and other activities designed to bring employers into compliance with the law. The penalties for child labor violations depend on the severity of the violations, the number of times the violations occurred, and aggravating factors such as falsification of records and whether the employer has a record of previous child labor. Over the past decade, according to data tabulated from CPS, the number and characteristics of working children have not changed. In 2001, working children were as sizable a part of the United States labor force as they were in 1990. Most children worked in a variety of occupations concentrated in a few select industries, primarily in the manufacturing industry. The penalties range from $275 for a record-keeping violation to $11,000 for a violation involving a serious injury or death. Information on WHD’s investigations, violations, and penalties assessed is tracked in its investigations database–the Wage and Hour Investigative Support and Reporting Database. In 2001, as in 1990, minority children and children from families with annual incomes below $25,000 were more likely than other children to work illegally. As many as 3.7 million children between the ages of 15 and 17 worked, about 30 percent of all children in this age range. The percentage of children who worked in summer months fluctuated over the decade from a high of 36 percent in 1990 to a low of 30 percent in 2001. Although most children work for an employer, in 2001, about 52,000 (2 percent) were self-employed. About 4 percent of all children who worked were employed in agriculture in 2001. Most children working in crop agriculture throughout the decade were boys aged 16 and 17. The percentage of boys increased, as did the percentage of children who were foreign-born and newcomers to this country. The characteristics of children incrop agriculture changed somewhat over the decade, according to the data in the National Agricultural Workers Survey. The data in this survey, however, does not show that the characteristics of crop agriculture children have changed. Most children working in agriculture are 16 years of age and older. The percentage of younger children (14- and 15-year-olds) who work in agriculture has increased, from 17 percent to 30 percent. More children work in summer months when school is out of session than in school months. In 2001, 30 percent of all children worked in agriculture; in 2012, it was 31 percent. The number of children who entered the country illegally to work in Agriculture rose over the decade, as did the percentage of those who were not accompanied by their parents. aged 15 to 17 worked in summer months, compared to 23 percent who worked in school months. 87 percent of all working children worked part-time in 2001. Children worked about the same number of hours in 2001 as in 1990. In 2001, children worked an average of 21 hours a week inSummer months. This is similar to the number of. hours they worked in both summer and school months in 1990, when they worked an. average of 16 hours per week in summer and summer months. 1990, their average hourly earnings increased by 10 percent. The older a child is, the more likely he or she is to work. In 1990, children paid an hourly salary earned an average of $5.70 an hour; in 2001, the average hourly salary was $6.36. The amount by which their earnings exceeded the minimum wage increased by $1.21. By 2001, children’s average hourly Earnings exceeded the Minimum Wage of $ 5.15 an hour. greater in the summer when more children work. Older children are more likely to work in the retail trade industry than younger children. For example, in summer months in 2001, nearly 60 percent of all 17-year-olds worked. In 2001, 17- years-old boys worked an average of 23 hours a week in summer hours, 5 more hours a year than 15-years-olds and 2 more years a week than 16-somethings. In the summer months of 2001, 33 percent of 16-year old boys worked, while only 15 percent of 15-year olds worked. of employed 17-year-olds worked in retail trade, whereas 38 percent of employed 15-year old worked in this industry. Children from families with lower incomes are less likely to work than those from higher income families, and minority children are less Likely to Work than white children. In addition to age, family income and race are also related to children’s employment. About 1 in 5 children in the U.S. are employed in some form of retail trade or other industry, according to a recent study. 17 percent of children in families with annual incomes below $25,000 a year worked in 2001. In 2001, 15 percent of black children and 17 percent of Hispanic children worked. Despite the fact that children from lower income families are less likely to work, when they do work, they tend to work more hours. Children in Families with Annual Incomes Under $75,000 worked an average of 21 hours a week in 2001, 5 more hours per week than children in Families With Incomes Over $75k. children whose families had annual incomes of $75,000 or more. While all minority children were less likely to work than white children, Hispanic children who were employed worked more hours than other children. As many as 4 percent of all 15- to 17-year-olds who worked in 2001 worked illegally, either because they worked more. hours than allowed under the law or because they work in prohibited hazardous occupations. Because the federal government does not track child labor, it is difficult to determine how many children work illegally. Child labor provisions of FLSA for 15-year-olds are more restrictive. In 2001, over 21 percent of all employed 15- year-olds worked illegally in school months. This compares to 1 percent of 16- and 17-year old workers. Most of the children who worked illegally were 15- years-old who worked more hours than allowed. The percentage of 15-somethings who worked illegal in schoolmonth increased over the period. The overall percentage of children who work illegally in both summer months and school months remained constant from 1990 to 2001. under the child labor provisions of FLSA. Of the 15-year-olds who worked illegally, nearly 80 percent worked an excessive number of hours. Because of the hours restrictions, they were much more likely to work illegally in school months than in summer months. Although most children worked in the retail trade industry during the past decade, a substantial percentage of the illegal employment was in prohibited industries and occupations. They also worked more than the allowed number ofhours, and they also worked in prohibited occupations. was found in other industries (see fig. 3). In 2001, although only 3 percent of all children worked in manufacturing, this industry accounted for 14 percent of. all illegally employed children. Children who were employed in prohibited occupations were most commonly employed illegally in transportation-related occupations. Over 40 percent of children employed illegally were employed illegally because they worked in transportation related occupations, according to our estimates. The majority of children who worked in these occupations were working in sales and services occupations, but also in manufacturing and construction. worked in prohibited occupations worked as truck drivers. We determined that a child’s gender, race, and citizenship status were related to the likelihood that he or she worked in a prohibited occupation. There was no correlation, however, between family income and prohibited occupations. In 2001, boys were more likely than girls to work in prohibited jobs. In addition, black children were less likely than children of other races. Children who were not citizens were morelikely than those who were citizens to work. income and children who worked in hazardous occupations. 32 percent of all employed 15-year-olds with family incomes less than $25,000 a year worked more hours than allowed under the law. Hispanic children are more likely to work too many hours than other children. The region of the country in which children live as well as the type of area in which they live (metropolitan or nonmetropolitan) are also associated with illegal employment. In 2001, 42 percent of Hispanic 15- year-olds worked more years than allowed during school months. In school months in 2001, 15-year-olds in the South and West were almost 1.5 times more likely than their counterparts in the Northeast and Midwest to work more hours than allowed. The data on children who work has been collected in CPS for 50 years, and therefore provides useful information on children's work habits, the report says. The report also found that 15- year-olds who lived in metropolitan areas were 1.4 times more Likely to work. more hours. than those who lived. in nonmetropolitan areas. Data on children younger than age 15 are not collected by CPS. In 1989, Labor stopped collecting data on 14-year-olds in CPS. These children are allowed under FLSA and its implementing regulations to work in many jobs. The estimates presented in this report paint an incomplete picture of the employment patterns for younger children, the report says. The U.S. Department of Labor has released a new report on child labor trends in the United States. The report will be released on Thursday. While some data are collected directly from children who work, most of the information in CPS on working children is provided by an adult member of the household. Because the adult answering the questions may not be aware of the full extent of the child’s activities, information about the child's employment may be underreported or omitted. Another BLS survey, NLSY, collects information on children differently. In NLSy, children are directly asked by interviewers to describe their jobs as well as their activities at The percentage of children who work reported in NLSY is much higher than in CPS. For example, about 24 percent of all 15-year-olds worked in a particular week during the summer of 1996,while CPS data showed that 18 percent of 15- year-olds working in that same period. In addition, NLSy collects data on younger children who worked. For more information, visit NlsY97.work and CPS97. Work.work, or call 1-800-273-8255 or visit www.nlsy97.com. example, NLSY97 showed that 13 percent of all 14-year-olds worked for an employer in a particular week during the summer of 1996. The number and characteristics of children who die each year as a result of a work-related injury have changed little over the past decade. From 1992 to 2000, the number of fatalities and the fatality rates for working were the same as they were in the early 1990s. (See table 4 for more information) The number of children in the U.S. who die from a work related injury was the same in the 1990s as it was in the 1980s. The number and characteristics of work-related fatalities and fatality rates for working children remained relatively constant from 1992 to 2000. Most of the children killed were boys 16 years of age or older. Boys were almost eight times more likely to die as a result of a work- related injury than girls. Retail trade and construction accounted for 20 percent and 14 percent of all fatalities, respectively. Children who worked for small employers account for nearly two-thirds of the fatalities for which employer size was reported. for all work-related injuries serious enough to cause children to miss at least one day of work. NIOSH’s estimate was based on records of injuries treated in emergency rooms. Different types of injuries were more prevalent among those reported by employers. BLS data for 1992 to 2000 showed that sprains, strains, and tears were the most common injuries. The BLS and NIOSH data also, over time, indicate different trends in the numbers of work- related injuries to children. of the injuries occurred to boys, even though they accounted for only about half of all working children. During this period, children aged 16 and over sustained the vast majority of all work-related injuries. Injuries are caused by a variety of factors, but most frequently from coming into contact with an object or equipment. About 65 percent of the injuries from 1992 to 2000 required children to miss 5 or fewer days of work, while 20 percent required them to miss more than 10 days. Labor has devoted substantial resources to ensuring compliance with the child labor provisions of FLSA. Since 1990, Labor has developed better goals for increasing employer compliance with the child labor provisions of FLSA. Labor recently established specific goals for fiscal year 2003 for the industries in which children are most likely to work. Labor does not provide sufficient guidance and training to its regional and district offices on how to use their resources most effectively or help them consistently apply the child labour provisions ofFLSA. WHD has not developed adequate methods of measuring the success of its child labor compliance efforts over the past decade. district offices to conduct self-initiated child labor investigations. WHD officials told us that it is not necessary for the national office to require all of its district offices to do so. However, WHD would have missed a large proportion of the cases with child labor violations if some district offices had not conducted self- initiated investigations. In some years, many districts had no child labor initiatives and the number of child labor Initiatives varied significantly from one region to another. In addition, some regional and district offices do not use data on previous child labor Violations to target their compliance efforts. that limited resources are used in the most effective manner. establish additional specific, measurable goals for WHD’s child labor compliance efforts for industries in which children are most likely to be injured or killed. develop methods of measuring the success of WHD's child labor efforts, including its education and outreach activities. routinely obtain data from BLS and NIOSH on the industries, occupations, and locations in which. children work and sustain work-related injuries. consider enhancing the data collected on children who work by expanding CPS to include 14-year olds. To estimate the number of children who are employed illegally in the United States, we compared data obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’s Current Population Survey. Because CPS does not capture data on children in the U.S. who work in occupations that are illegal under criminal statutes, we could not include them in our estimates. We compared CPS data for 1990, 1996, and 2001 to the child labor provisions of FLSA by defining the base population and identifying illegal employment by occupation and hours. We further refined this analysis by using data from January 1995 to September 1997. through the use of logistic regression for illegal occupations and cross- tabulations for hours. We used data from 36 monthly surveys from CPS for the following years: 1990, 1996 and 2001. For each year, we created data sets with children aged 15 to 17. Each year held roughly 70,000 observations. We defined the base population by using the child labor provisions of FLSA as a guide. Because FLSA does not apply to children who are self-employed, we eliminated children who work in agriculture. who were self-employed and those who worked in agriculture from the data set. Key questions concerning child employment in a family business were not added to CPS until 1994. To obtain numbers of children who worked illegally, we averaged the results of the 2001 base population with the results from the 1990 base population. These children are not covered by FLSA, so we included them in the 2001 data set, even though they are not legally employed in the U.S. as a result of the law. CPS treats ethnicity separately from race. A child can be identified in CPS as both “white” and “Hispanic.” To separately determine the effect of illegal employment on whites, blacks, and Hispanics, we coded the number of children who worked illegally in summer months. The number of illegal workers in the U.S. in the summer months was higher than in the school year, according to the CPS report. The CPS report was released on Tuesday. It is available online at www.cps.org. children whose race was identified as “white” or “black” and whose ethnicity wasidentified as ‘Hispanic,’ as ’Hispanic’ only. For children whose race. was identified. as � ‘black’ or ‘white,�’ and their ethnicity was identified ‘non-Hispanic,' we included them in the category of race identified. This resulted in four racial categories: white, black, Hispanic, and other. For 1996 and 2001, “Other” included Asians and Native Americans. Using methods developed in our previous report and refined by Douglas Kruse, we defined a list of 100 occupational codes that correspond to activities prohibited by the Hazardous Occupations Orders. Any child in the base population with one of these codes was included in our estimates of children employed illegally. We used a similar method to identify occupations specifically prohibited for 15-year-olds. In this instance, 216 occupational codes matched the descriptions of activities prohibited to children under 16. Any. child identified in the Base population with a code that matched this description was included. children employed illegally. Due to the small sample sizes of children identified in these groups, cross tabulations were not statistically significant at the 0.05 level. To determine demographic differences in the likelihood of working illegally, the following variables were included in the model: sex, race, urbanicity (metropolitan or non-metropolitan area), income, citizenship, and region. Differences that were found to be statistically significant are indicated in table 12 below. We used the CPS variable that describes the number of children employed in illegal occupations. number of hours actually worked each week to determine whether 15-year-olds worked more hours than allowed each week under FLSA. Children who worked over 18 hours in a week in school months, from September to May, were included in our estimates of illegal employment. We further refined this analysis by conducting cross tabulations for race, industry, occupation, sex, geographic region, metropolitan area, and income. To estimate the number of 15- year-olds who worked more than allowed under the law, we conducted cross-tabulations for Race, Industry, Occupation, Sex and Geographic Region. We used data for the four regions defined in CPS: Midwest, Northeast, South, and West. The states included in each region are Midwest: Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. Northeast: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont. South: Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, andWest Virginia. West: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. To estimate illegal employment in each state, we combined CPS data for 4 years (48 monthly surveys) from 1998 to 2001. FLSA and implementing regulations and guidance describe activities that children are prohibited from performing. Although CPS data on occupations are fairly specific, they do not list the actual activities children perform on the job. It is not possible to determine whether each child who works in a prohibited occupation category is actually performing prohibited activities. As a result, our estimates of illegal employment are both under- and overstated. many of the child labor violations found by WHD in its investigations of employers are violations of the restrictions on number of hours and times of day that children are allowed to work. CPS does not collect information on the characteristics of employers for which children work, such as sales volume or other proxies for annual dollar amount. Finally, our estimates are overstated to the extent that they include children whose employment is not covered under FLSA, either because their employers do not meet the threshold for enterprise coverage or because the child does not work in interstate commerce. volume of sales, or information that could be used to determine whether children work in interstate commerce. We used data from NLSY97, the survey of children born from 1980 to 1984, to estimate the number of 12- to 14-year-olds who work. The extent to which our estimates are overstated because not all children work under FLSA cannot be determined. We coded children noted in NLSy97 as being born in 1982 as being 12 to 14 years of age. 14 years old in 1996 and children born in 1983 as 14 in 1997. We identified those weeks that contained the 12th day of the month. We determined the frequency of employed children in each of the 16 weeks and averaged the result over the total number of months in each period. We performed these calculations for three periods in 1995, 1996 and one period in 1997 as shown in table 4 in this report. For more information, visit: http://www.nlsy.org/news/features/features-top-stories/1996-97.html. Most employment questions in NLSY deal with events that take place after the child’s 14th birthday. As a result, we used a different method to estimate employment for children younger than 14 years of age. One of the variables identified children who indicated that they had received income from a job in the previous year (1996) We coded children born in 1983 and 1984 as being 13 years and 12 years old. We coded these children as having been employed at some point in the past year. To calculate fatality and injury rates for children, we used data from three BLS sources. We identified 15- to 17-year-olds who died as a result of a work-related injury or sustained a nonfatal injury from 1992 to 2000. Because the number of deaths was so high, we calculated the fatality rate for the previous year. We used the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries and Survey of Occupational injuries and Illnesses to identify the number and characteristics of 15-to-17 year olds who died. We used data from 108 monthly surveys to obtain the total number of hours worked by 15- to 17-year-olds between 1992 and 2000. In computing the rates for nonfatal injuries, we excluded children who worked for the government or were self-employed because they are excluded from the data. We totaled the hours worked each week by all children for each year. We did not aggregate the data on nonf fatal injuries over the decade because the number of injuries reported was large. We calculated fatality and injury rates by using the total amount of hours children worked. industries. Because the data sets for fatal and nonfatal injuries use different industry groupings than CPS, we combined industries. Because we were not able to obtain SOII data that only included 15- to 17-year-olds by industry, we calculated industry rates by dividing the total number of injuries to children under 18. Since CPS data do not include hours worked by children younger than 15, we were unable to include these children in our calculations. However, we did include them in our calculation of industry rates. since children under 15 make up less than 1 percent of all injuries to children, this discrepancy did not affect our estimates. Several legislative proposals were introduced in the 107th Congress to strengthen the child labor provisions of FLSA. In July 2002, the Senate passed the Traveling Sales Crew Protection Act, legislation designed to ensure that child employees of the traveling sales crew are protected from child labor. The bill was passed by the Senate in July 2002 and signed into law by President George W. Bush. The number and characteristics of children who worked from 1990 to 2001 as tabulated from the Current Population Survey (CPS) data we obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) are detailed in the tables below. Other legislative proposals introduced in the 107th Congress are listed in table 13 below. The law includes provisions that prohibit children under age 18 from working in traveling sales work where they remain away from home for more than 24 hours. Our draft report acknowledged the difficulty of estimating the number of children employed in violation. of the child labor provisions of FLSA and the limitations of using CPS data to provide such estimates. While recognizing these limitations, we continue to believe that our analysis provides the best estimates that can be made with available data. In fact, we used the same methods as those used to develop estimates cited by BLS and WHD in several of their publications. For example, in BLS’s November 2000 Report on the Youth Labor Force, they cited estimates of the number of children illegally employed. Labor cites the drop in workplace injuries indicated by the BLS data from the Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses as evidence that “the workplace is becoming safer for young workers.” NIOSH data from emergency room records that indicates that workplace injuries to children are on the rise. Although we highlighted many of Labor’s efforts to improve child labor laws, we highlight many of their efforts to make the workplace safer for children as well as for adults. We also highlight the fact that Labor has been trying to improve the workplace for children for years. ensure compliance with the child labor provisions of FLSA. WHD is correct in its statement that the number of investigator hours devoted to child labor enforcement in fiscal year 2001, 74,000 hours, represents the largest investment of investigator time by WHD in the last 5 years. However, our report, which focuses on WHD’s efforts since 1990, shows that this is lower than the resources dedicated to child labour enforcement in the first half of the decade. We continue to believe that the trends in the number. of child labor violations found and the amount of penalties assessed are not valid indicators of WHD.’S commitment to child. labor compliance. 2001 indicates a growing problem with child labor, improvements in WHD’s efforts to identify violations, or other factors. In 2002, the maximum penalty for a child labor violation was raised from $10,000 to $11,000. We believe the most important indicator of compliance is the percentage of employers who are in compliance with the child labor provisions of FLSA. We disagree that our analysis of fatality rates is a “flawed interpretation of the BLS and NIOSH data” Labor cites only the fatality rates and number of deaths in the wholesale trade industry. We found that the injury rates for children working in this industry were also relatively high. Some of the most serious child labor violations WHD found occurred in sawmills and companies that produce wood pallets. WHD has not developed methods of measuring the success of all of its child labor compliance efforts, particularly its education and outreach and other compliance assistance activities. We also found, in our discussions with WHD officials, that establishing coverage for employers in the construction industry was not a problem. child labor compliance surveys of other industries. 26. In our conversations with WHD headquarters officials and in WHD publications, the number of investigations, violations found, and civil monetary penalties were frequently cited as indicators of the success of the WHD’s child labor enforcement efforts. 27. In fact, on page 3 of the agency”s comments on our report, Labor cites the increase from fiscal years 2000 to 2001 in the number. of child labor violations and the total amount of penalties assessed as evidence of “WHD’S continued strong commitment to child labor compliance” WHD routinely uses BLS and NIOSH data to plan the allocation of its child labor resources. Many states refuse to release this information to WHD because of privacy concerns. WHD has, in fact, used state workers’ compensation data to. plan its enforcement efforts. The district offices we visited confirmed that they do not receive this information for use in planning their local child labor. efforts. We found that WHD. has no procedures for routinely obtaining data from BLS or NIOSH to plan its. child laborenforcement efforts. the past, used only limited data from its WHISARD investigations database to plan its enforcement efforts. In some cases, reports we requested from the database, such as reports that showed the source of investigations completed in fiscal years 2000 and 2001, was the first time that WHD had run such reports. We believe the anecdotal information on injuries and fatalities maintained by WHD’s national office does not provide enough information to be useful in making WHD's resource allocation decisions. The information on fatalities and serious injuries to children was provided to us in May. 2002 contained data on only 7 fatalities and 36 injuries reviewed by WHD in fiscal year 2001. We clarified our conclusions to acknowledge that collecting these data may require additional resources. We agree with Labor’s statement that our recommendation to consider enhancing the data collected on children who work by expanding CPS to include 14-year-olds or beginning additional cohorts of NLSY cannot be implemented without additional study and resources, which is why we recommended that the Secretary “consider” these actions. We continue to believe that WHD’s regional and district offices cannot target their resources in the most effective manner without having better criteria from WHD's national office on how to target their enforcement efforts. We also believe WHD should use information from BLS and NIOSH on the industries in which children work and those in which they are most likely to be injured or killed.

The panel was only an initial step in a possible long-term, evolving effort to develop and sustain discussion on ATC modernization. It brought together generalists, rather than specialists, to address broad themes and consider how to organize a more comprehensive approach. Because our scope was limited, we could not include a large number of leading experts, institutions, and networks involved in specialized efforts. Furthermore, although many points of view were represented, the panel was not representative of all potential potential ATC users. stakeholders. Second, even though we, in cooperation with the National Academies, conducted preliminary research and heard from national experts in their fields, a day’s conversation cannot represent the current practice in this vast arena. More thought, discussion, and research are needed to develop greater agreement on what we really know, what needs to be done, and how to do it. Nevertheless, the panel provided a rich dialogue on ATC modernization and the panelists developed strong messages in responding to each of the three questions. Those messages are highlighted below. FAA is “very resistant” to having private organizations, rather than FAA, develop new procedures and systems for FAA to approve and institute, panelists say. Several panelists saw resistance to change as a consequence of federal employment. A government organization is insulated from changes, the panelists said. They identified multiple, currently available options for addressing these factors, but none are currently available. The FAA’s modernization program is expected to be completed by the end of the year. the economic pressures that the private sector faces, one of the panelists indicated. In his view, federal employees do not have the firsthand experience with layoffs and business failures to understand, as private aviation industry employees do. Other panelists emphasized the reluctance of management to change. According to a panelist with experience in restructuring a foreign air traffic organization, the senior and middle managers could not or would not adjust to the change and had to be let go within the first 2 years of the restructuring. The other employees also had difficulty adjusting and were still adjusting in some respects, he said. Getting management on the right page was the real challenge. Another panelist questioned why the ATO’s new COO had replaced only two top managers in theATO and simply reassigned other managers. Still another panelist suggested that cultural change within the AT o alone would not be sufficient to ensure the ATo’S success, because so much of its fate depends on other organizations, including FAA, DOT, the Office of The air traffic controllers’ union is “very political,” several panelists asserted. One panelist charged that it was “hindering the progress’ of a performance-based organization. The union delayed the adoption of technologies such as the User Request Evaluation Tool (URET) because some controllers saw them as a threat to its membership. Another panelist cited the union’s long-term opposition to the implementation of a software program that tracks productivity—a key measure. change can be an issue outside FAA as well as within it, panelists noted. For example, one panelist questioned how much support the ATO was getting from DOT, OMB, and congressional committees for changing “some extremely entrenched political fiefdoms” Another panelist said that he had found the congressional authorizing committees amenable to changes, but the appropriators liked things the way they were. In addition to having a vision, it is important for the ATo to tie that vision to what is expected of them, the panelists said. FAA cannot do everything alone from the inside, because airplanes and airports, for example, need to be equipped with the technologies that will help realize the vision. Employing a team concept could help overcome resistance to the implementation of new technologies, according to another panelist. Putting engineers, finance people, controllers, and electronic technologists together, all on the same team, could unite them as they moved through the stages of implementation, the panelist said. When the time comes to field a technology, the focus would be on getting it up and running. A change in management’s approach could go a long way toward overcoming controllers’ and other employees’ resistance to change. One foreign air traffic organization changed its whole approach to the unions and the staff, started talking to them as people. Union representatives and managers take the same courses together and address issues of affordability together, one panelist said. As a result, controllers�’ pay has increased, costs have dropped, and productivity has increased. The panelist implied that obstructing its implementation because it might threaten jobs was not a good idea. Managers have stopped seeing employees as a problem and have started to see them as part of the solution. The only way to bring about a cultural transformation is to replace those who resist change, either by allowing them to retire or by hiring others to take their places. In the corporate world, one panelist observed, a new executive brings in a new management team to support a cultural turnaround. The new team is then loyal to the company, the panelist said. The key to these positive results is psychological change, he said. to the new executive. Technical as well as cultural factors have impeded ATC modernization. FAA does not have “the engineering technical capability to deal with an extremely complex, highly nonlinear adaptive system,” one speaker said. Another panelist further noted that an executive in the private sector replaced the top 200 people in his organization to achieve the transformation he was seeking, according to several of the panelists. In the view of this panelist, the COO’s hiring of only two new managers and reassignment of other managers would not be sufficient to turn the ATO's culture around. got technical safety risk as a key technical parameter. FAA does not apply rigorous systems engineering expertise early in nonadvocate technical reviews of project proposals. As a result, a number of FAA’s programs had fundamental system engineering technical issues that were not identified early in the program. The risks were not mitigated, and the programs experienced significant cost growth, the panel said. The panel's findings were published in a report titled, “The Future of Air-to-Ground Communications.” FAA lacks a rudder, in a technical sense, for modernization, panelists say. To help address its lack of technical expertise, ATO could obtain advice from an independent board or information from other countries, they say. “The system engineering organization in FAA is nothing more than a process organization,” another panelist said. It doesn’t matter what the systems engineering people do, their job is to keep doing plans and processes, they said. They think that meetings are products. on technologies that they have already adopted. A technical advisory board made up of system engineers could review proposals for FAA and demand the kinds of data and tests needed to scrub the proposals. Hiring skilled engineers instead of relying on contractors might enable the ATO to develop systems more economically and efficiently, one panelist suggested. This panelist described how a foreign air traffic services organization develops new ATC systems in-house and seldom uses contractors. It now employs skilled engineers, rather than contractors, to develop the systems. utilizes its engineers to build systems rather than manage contractors. As a result, he said, it is now developing the systems it needs faster and at less cost. Maximizing the use of commercial inputs was the recommendation of another panelist, who said that FAA needs to get out of the business of designing systems. According to him, most companies no longer develop their own large, complex systems. Instead, they get other people to do that for them in the private sector, he added. commercial systems have a shorter economic service life than the systems that FAA designs. The ATO could profitably take advantage of the experiences of other countries’ air traffic organizations, one panelist said. He maintained that the ATO should institute “a fundamental requirement and a cultural expectation” that it will review existing technologies before it buys or tries to develop its own. With a multibillion-dollar budget for software and other information technology, he said, the ATo has ample opportunity to save money. FAA plans to train or hire people with needed skills to address shortfalls in technical expertise. Recognizing that cultural factors can play a critical role in an organization’s success, the ATO has initiated organizational changes that are designed to create. FAA is addressing some of the cultural and technical factors panelists identified as affecting ATC modernization. The ATO's COO also provides additional information from previous GAO reports and work in progress on how FAA is addressed some of these issues. a foundation for cultural change and deliver benefits to customers efficiently. For example, the ATO established collaborative teams of technical experts and ATC system. It reorganized air traffic services and the research and acquisition organization along functional lines of business. It reduced layers of management from 11 to 7 to help address the hierarchical nature of the organization. It conducted an organizationwide activity value analysis to determine the full range of activities that ATO headquarters is engaged in, and the value customers place on those activities. FAA sent a large number of detailed e-mails in response to a call for recommendations to improve internal communications. FAA’s management culture was “intensely hierarchical, risk averse,” and “reactionary.” Now, FAA is attempting to foster “results-focused, proactive and innovative behavior” Changing the agency’‘s leadership model is also designed to replace a “personality-driven culture” with a sustainable, stable, viable organization. rational decisions that transcend changes in political leadership. The ATO is trying to better align FAA’s priorities and stakeholders’ interests by developing a strategy map. Called the Strategic Management Process, this effort borrows heavily from a private-sector model. According to FAA, the strategy map will enable owners and customers to clearly understand both the services that the ATo is providing and the effects of products in development on those services. The strategy map is expected to be completed by the end of the year. FAA's Strategic Management Process will ensure linkage between FAA’s operating and capital budgets. Future budgetary conversations will revolve around the desired level of service, instead of focusing on a product. Ultimately, the ATO wants to know how much every unit of output costs so that it can satisfy those needs with cost. The ATO created “value-based” performance metrics; that is, it defined its performance in terms of customers’ needs and connected efforts to satisfy those Needs with Cost. allocate and compare costs and measure productivity. Each organizational unit and facility is developing applicable metrics for performance so that the ATO can compare costs, identify factors that affect costs, and use this information to improve performance. For example, each en route facility is determining its hourly cost to control flights. The ATO then compare and analyze these costs to identify positive and negative factors affecting performance and productivity. plan is a response to a congressional mandate, based on a recommendation we made in 2002, that FAA develop a plan for addressing an impending wave of controller retirements. Panelists identified and discussed the impact of funding constraints and the federal budget process on ATC modernization. The most immediate issue is a critical shortage of funds to meet the current modernization program’s plans and users’ demands. Severe reductions in the funding for A TC modernization, if required to address the currently projected shortfall, could exacerbate what one panelist described as the traditional underfunding of the ATC system's capital requirements. The political process influences budget decisions in the administration as well as in Congress. does not reveal synergies between projects. As a result, when the appropriators decide not to fund a project, they may not understand how their decision will affect other projects. Separation of capital and operating costs in FAA’s accounting system may lead, in some instances, to investments in technologies that end up in a warehouse because the ATO can’t afford to operate them. It discourages analyses of life-cycle costs and may lead to investments that are not needed. The firewall makes it difficult to see the relationship between software replacement (capital) and maintenance (operating) costs, panelists said. Decision to postpone purchases of new or upgraded software may save capital investment costs, but rising maintenance requirements may increase operating costs. Eventually, the maintenance costs may “far exceed” the replacement costs, one panelist said. The budget is not integrated to show what investments buy in, other panelists noted. It is also difficult to determine the impact of capital investment decisions on operating costs, they said. terms of productivity, safety, or environmental benefits. FAA’s capital budget fails to show the impact of investments on the country. This can lead to funding projects that will provide limited benefits for users. The ATO could take a number of steps to address its current financial situation, the panelists said. These steps included accepting the budget process as it is and reducing spending to match revenues, developing strategies for presenting the ATO's budget request more clearly to Congress, and implementing regulatory changes. and procedural changes to allow the use of existing cost-saving technologies. contracting with the private sector to provide certain air traffic services. obtaining information on other countries’ ATC technologies and on international technical standards. realistically be funded and to review and cut its programs in light of the current budget constraints. This panelist also recommended looking at longer term alternatives to annual appropriations that are available within the government and work well for other organizations, such as “working capital accounts and all kinds of industrial funding schemes” outages—that is, on replacing equipment that would otherwise fail. This panelist also said that FAA needs a customer-oriented business strategy and a business plan. Improving controllers’ productivity would be another way to save money, a fourth panelist said. But he characterized his suggestion as “touch the ground” with the ATO’s operating costs, which account for about three-quarters of its total costs. He suggested that the upcoming wave of air traffic controller retirements would create “an opportunity to redistribute and even to trim the work force in some areas. third rail of aviation politics. Another panelist emphasized the importance of starting to plan now to accommodate the airplanes that are being bought today to provide service for the next generation. For example, one panelist said that the ATO needed to understand the interconnections between ATC systems and break the big picture into nuggets so that it could clarify for the appropriators why they should not break apart the ATo’s capital investment plan and selectively fund only some components, he said. the firewall between its capital and operating budgets by modifying its budget submissions to show the future cost implications of current investment decisions. The ATO could pursue procedural and regulatory changes that would take advantage of existing technologies to increase capacity. Pilot test contracts with the private sector to provide certain air traffic services, and obtain information on technologies and procedures developed in other countries that could be used in the U.S. could also be pursued by the ATO under its current authorities, panelists said. They said. Panelists discussed the potential benefits of a more widespread use of a concept called area navigation (RNAV)RNAV allows operators of properly equipped aircraft to use onboard navigation capabilities to fly desired flight paths without requiring direct flight over ground-based navigation aids. This provides for more direct routing, avoiding suboptimal routes prescribed by conventional “highways in the sky” that are defined by point-to-point flying over ground. The RNAV concept and a major new method for exploiting it, called required navigation performance (RNP), permit flight in any direction. RNAV and RNP hold promise for saving system users time and money. They could potentially increase the capacity of the ATC system to handle air traffic. RNAV could potentially reduce the required distance (separation) between aircraft equipped with advanced navigation capabilities if the aircraft can safely operate closer to one another than FAA’s regulations currently allow. able to use these capabilities to their ability to fly shorter routes or avoid bad weather. It could also reduce the number of aircraft that need to be certified to meet the required accuracy level for navigation performance. Airlines are “crying for” FAA to approve RNP, one of the panelists said. Aircraft equipped with RNP capabilities could then fly alternative rolling, moving routes to avoid weather delays. Implementing RNP could also eventually lower the ATO’s costs, another panelist said. RNP technologies have been installed on larger aircraft for so long that some aircraft equipped with them are already in service, panelists say. The FAA has not approved procedures for its use in the United States. the technologies have already been retired to the desert, one panelist said. In addition, pilots have been trained to use the technologies, and the technologies are already being used in some other countries, including Canada. As a first step toward obtaining FAA’s approval of procedures for using RNP, the ATO could make policy announcements to set a tone and direction. These announcements would enlist the user community's support at little or no cost, the panelists said, and could be made as early as next year. cost to the ATO, give the ATo an early success, and help tie customers to theATO’s mission. However, it would be important for FAA to implement RNP in a way that did not “disenfranchise” general aviation interests and regional carriers whose aircraft are not already equipped with RNP technologies. Two panelists expressed concerns about the government's approach to regulating the use of onboard navigation equipment. According to one of these panelists, FAA has “the wrong conceptual framework” for developing regulations to implement new procedures. Disproportionate, he said, because it establishes the same safety standards for aircraft of all sizes. FAA needs to revise its approach to assessing and balancing risks. Obtaining information on technologies and procedures that other countries have already developed could help the ATO control costs. A shared vision is crucial for a globally based air traffic system, one panelist said. If contracting for flight service station services proved to be effective, FAA could contract for other air traffic services, such as oceanic, night, en route, or airways facilities. The ATO's organizational placement, combined with its dependence on Congress for funding, limits the COO’s ability to make decisions and take actions, panelists said. The COO is not a Chief Executive Officer, as one of the panelists observed. Instead, he reports to his “owners’—who include the FAA Administrator and the DOT Secretary, who in turn receive direction from the administration and Congress. Consequently, there is no oversight group that is expected to provide constructive criticism of FAA, one panelist said. FAA does not get “the kind of constructive advice that you might hope for.” Europe’s Performance Review Commission provides such constructive advice for EUROCONTROL, the European air traffic management organization. The commission serves as a panel of independent advisers and costs about $2.5 million a year. According to several panelists, the ATO's COO lacks the management tools that would be available to a private-sector CEO. His ability to plan modernization projects, set program priorities, and implement new technologies is constrained. OMB Director can revise his budget request and Congress can make further changes in the ATO’s budget. The 20-year vision of the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO) is at odds with the ATo, according to one panelist. Other panelists observed that the controllers’ union influences management’'s decisions. The COO lacks key financial data needed to determine, analyze, and manage the AT o's costs. When he was “parachuted” into theATO, as one panelists put it, he did not have the financial data he needed. have the numbers he needed to know where the ATO stood because FAA did not maintain basic information on the costs and value of existing systems. As a result, he spent most of his first year overseeing the implementation of a cost accounting system and collecting other key data. Their performance is constrained because their terms of employment and compensation are based largely on negotiated agreements rather than on performance. In addition, salary caps limit FAA’s ability to pay for technical expertise. As one panelist observed at the end of the panel, the ATO’s creation did not address the structural conflict of interest that exists because FAA is both the regulator and the operator of air traffic services. Another panelist noted that when his country restructured its air traffic organization, it immediately eliminated the same structural Conflict of interest. According to the first panelist, other countries that have reorganized their air traffic organizations have also done so. The regulator became more effective and the operators’ safety performance “significantly improved,” the second panelist said. instituted arms’ length regulation if they did not have it already. “We remain one of the few places that somehow thinks that self-regulation is a good idea, in spite of sort of overwhelming evidence in lots of arenas that it's not a very good idea," the ATO’s COO said. The ATO is developing a business plan that the FAA is developing to guide and monitor its operations. The FAA is addressing some of the structural changes that panelists proposed to improve the ATOs success over time. improve its operations and financial management, FAA has worked to develop three longer term planning documents. FAA is participating in a multiagency effort, sponsored by the JPDO, to develop a national plan for aviation in 2025 and beyond. It has developed a rolling 10-year effort, called the Operational Evolution Plan (OEP), through which FAA plans to increase the capacity of the NAS by one- third. FAA has published its Flight Plan for 2005 through 2009, a multiyear strategic effort that sets a 5-year course for FAA. Both the OEP and the JPDO’s plan are designed to help the NAS flow smoothly and meet future needs. The restructuring of U.S. air traffic services that has taken place thus far, through the establishment of a performance-based air traffic organization, constitutes “the first building block” of the longer term effort to transform the aviation system envisioned by the FAA. According to FAA, the Vice President of the Operations Planning Service Unit in the ATO is also the Director of the J PDO. in the JPDO’s 20-year plan. According to the COO, this vision of the U.S. aviation system will incorporate both technologies and processes. He acknowledged that the ATO has not yet connected this long- term vision with the financial and other challenges it currently faces. He said that his goal is to establish an organization that can execute the long-term vision and manage not only its finances but also its future. Over time, he said, he plans to expand the OEP to include a strategy and the. JPDO’s long-term vision, thereby “tie the vision to the viability of the future.” The OEP will then be “not just a set of projects,” but a project plan with a vision and a strategy that goes out 20 years. But given the current budget constraints, he conceded, the path to that goal is not clear. In March 2004, FAA created the Air Traffic Safety Oversight Service (AOV), under FAA’S Office of Aviation Safety. Safety oversight of FAA’s traffic function will be provided by a separate part of the agency. Although both organizations remain within FAA, under the FAA Administrator, they are less closely joined than they were previously. This step is a positive move toward providing “arm’S length’ safety oversight, although it doesn’t go as far as placing the two organizations in separate federal agencies or removing one of the agencies from the federal government. The establishment of the AOV responds directly to a recommendation by the 1997 National Civil Aviation Review Commission. Government altogether. For many, the steps taken thus far to create a performance-based organization were insufficient. The ATO still had a long way to go to achieve its goals. Some panelists were united in their desire for the ATO to succeed, but they generally agreed that its opportunities for success were constrained within a government system. At our request, the panelists concluded the panel with their parting thoughts on the day’s discussion, including any advice they had for FAA or for Congress. stressed the importance of progressing by small steps within the existing system. Small steps might include obtaining good performance and cost information, scoping programs in accordance with current budget projections. It was critical, one panelist said, for the ATO to “have some small early practical successes” to enlist the political support of the user community and help tie the customers to theATO’s mission. Other panelists focused on the obstacles within the system that have been identified as a problem. they believed would impede or prevent success. Among the obstacles they cited were the counterproductive incentives inherent in the budget process. It was important, one panelist said, to overcome this opposition by describing “the difference between how things are and how they might be” Still other panelists looked to the future, calling for international help to develop new air traffic technologies. The U.S. government’s refusal to allow newAir traffic technologies to be used, and opposition to organizational and technological change, were cited as obstacles. technical benchmarks to promote efficient development, business models that take into account operational trends. As one panelist said, “we have to target the future mix of real operations that we’re really going to see, not build the world’s most perfect system from 1956” Despite their reservations, the panelists generally agreed that stakeholders should not “allow the concept of privatization to be the enemy of moving forward with the ATO,” they said. The ATO is a government organization. the ATO, as one panelist said, or “sacrifice the good for the better” in the words of another. Instead, taking a two-pronged approach would be the best way, in the view of most panelists, for the ATO to meet its immediate and longer term challenges. Clinton V.

Summary:
SOCOM was the first combatant command endowed with acquisition authority and its own budget line for training and equipping its forces. If SOCOM wants to acquire a weapon system that is not special operations specific, the acquisition must be executed through one of the military departments. SOCOM has an Acquisition Executive who has the authority to negotiate memoranda of agreement with military departments to carry out the acquisition of equipment, material, and supplies. The structure's design is similar to that of the other services, which also follow a Secretary/Commander-AE-PEO-PM structure. programs are given an Acquisition Category (ACAT) designation based on dollar figures and program scope. These designations determine the level of oversight required for the program. SOCOM and the military departments adhere to the same oversight standards and dollar threshold for categorizing programs. According to officials, SOCOM has a total of six programs that exceed the category II dollar thresholds. Currently, the Silent Knight Radar program is developing a SOF-common terrain following/terrain avoidance radar system for use in SOF fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft. one of SOCOM's largest with a total estimated procurement cost through FY2023 of at $391.7 million. FY2017 actual procurement funding budget for the program was $34 million. In comparison, the military services have numerous major programs with significantly higher procurement appropriations. The Navy's 2017 appropriation for the Virginia Class submarine program ($5.39 billion) is 250% larger than SOCom's entire FY2017 procurement appropriation ($2.08 billion). In FY2017, the SOCOM procurement appropriation was 1.5% of DOD's total procurement appropriation of $132.2 billion. size and scope of the acquisition efforts result in SOCOM having a substantially smaller acquisition workforce than the services. SOCOM's acquisition workforce consists of approximately 500 civilian and military personnel, less than 1% of the total DOD acquisition workforce of 156,000. A number of analysts and government officials have argued that SOCOM benefits from its size relative to the military services. The current SOCOM Acquisition Executive also reiterated this point when he reportedly stated that "[SOCOM's] ability to move relatively fast is a function of scale" small business. Many analysts argue that small businesses and organizations can be more nimble, more innovative, and more adaptable than large enterprises. Sir Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group, reportedly stated, "Small businesses are nimble and bold and can often teach much larger companies a thing or two about innovations that can change entire industries" A 2004 congressional report identified SOCOM's unique capabilities. A number of analysts also argue thatsmall organizations are more effective in communication, innovation and redesign, customer service, and risk-taking. size, culture, and close proximity to the warfighter as factors that can contribute to more effective acquisitions. The successful use of the Special Operations Command acquisition authority below the acquisition category (ACAT) 1 level illustrates the transformation benefits of having a joint buyer, close to the user, maintain a streamlined acquisition process to deliver low dollar threshold systems rapidly. In discussing the SOCOM acquisition culture and the benefits of a flatter organization, a number of current and former SOCOM officials have stated that the lack of bureaucratic overhead allows the organization to be more effective. SOCOM programs have lower dollar thresholds, so they don't receive the same level of scrutiny brought to bear on the more expensive programs. Another factor that potentially enables SOCOM's culture of innovation and risk-taking in its acquisition programs is its general ability to execute programs below statutory and regulatory dollar figures that require more rigorous oversight. This point has been highlighted by James "Hondo" Geurts, current Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development, and Acquisition (and former SOCOM Acquisition Executive) The Nunn-McCurdy Act requires DOD to report to Congress when an MDAP experiences cost overruns of 15% or more. There are currently more than 150 MDAPs in DOD; many of these programs have a larger budget in a single year than SOCOM's entire procurement budget for FY2017. If SOCOM’s current CAT II program (Silent Knight Radar) experienced 100% cost growth (from approximately $391 million to $782 million), it would still not require a Nunn/McCurdy notification to Congress. CVN-78 Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier was approximately 70% of SOCOM's entire FY2017 procurement budget ($2.0 billion) Some analysts believe that these lower dollar thresholds allow SOCOM to operate below the radar. Despite these perceived organizational advantages, SOCOM has experienced challenges in executing its acquisition programs. The Advanced SEAL Delivery System Program, intended to develop a covert submersible insertion vehicle, was documented by both the Government Accountability Office and RAND as experiencing considerable cost, schedule, and performance issues. SOCOM's statutory restriction to procure strictly SOF-peculiar equipment, modifications, and services enables a more focused, operations-oriented acquisition culture. In a National Defense interview, James Smith reportedly stated the following: Our direct relationship to USSOCOM for the acquisition of only services and equipment that are unique to special operations gives us three primary advantages. First,USSOCOM is a combatant command with a more focus on special operations than other commands. Second, the SOF acquisition culture gives SOCOM the ability to execute acquisitions more efficiently and effectively. an extremely relevant ongoing mission. We're fully co-located and integrated with the staff here. We have a firsthand understanding of priorities and urgency that gives us a different appreciation for schedule emphasis. It's not a cliché to say that our operators will often accept the "80 percent" solution if we can get that solution into the fight sooner. The services, on the other hand, have a much broader acquisition mandate, including the acquisition of business systems, weapon procurement programs that must be integrated into joint operations. technologies and capabilities. SOCOM benefits from being a smaller organization with a more focused mission set and limited scope of acquisition authorities. Other SOCOM attributes, such as delegating more decisionmaking to lower levels and promoting a more risk-taking culture, may be transferable to the services. A number of current senior acquisition officials in the military services recently served in SOCOM and appear to be promoting more delegation of authority and cultural risk- Taking in the services, including General Petraeus and General McChrystal. Congress may ask: To what extent do current acquisition-related laws and regulations promote or inhibit a more efficient, less bureaucratic, and more balanced approach to risk in acquisitions? In some instances SOCOM has fewer acquisition authorities than the military departments. This occurs where legislation grants acquisition authorities or flexibilities to the SOCOM branch. In some cases SOCOM may have less acquisition authority than military departments, such as in the case of the U.S. Air Force, which has less acquisition powers than the Army. The definition of military departments, codified in 50 U.S.C. 3004, does not include SOCOM. As a result, SOCOM may not receive new acquisition authorities provided by Congress. SOCOM must work through the Secretary of Defense to obtain these authorities or seek a legislative change. Potential associated issues for Congress may include the following: Based on the DOD report on acquisition authorities required in the 2018 NDAA, should additional acquisition authorities should be granted to SOCOM? Should the definition ofMilitary departments as they relate to acquisitions be changed? modified to include SOCOM? Appendix A. Comparison of Chains of Command with SOCOM. Appendix B.

Summary:
Fiscal year 2011 marked the eighth year of implementation of the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA) IPIA requires executive branch agencies to annually review all programs and activities to identify those that are susceptible to significant improper payments. IPERA, enacted July 22, 2010, amended IPIA by expanding the scope of the IPIA. The act was enacted to reduce improper payments for programs with estimates that exceed $10 million. It was also the first year of Implementation for theimproperpayments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010. on the previous requirements for identifying, estimating, and reporting on programs and activities susceptible to significant improper payments. IPERA included a new, broader requirement for agencies to conduct recovery audits, where cost effective, for each program and activity with at least $1 million in annual program outlays. This IPERA provision significantly lowers the threshold for required recovery audits from $500 millionprograms and activities. Another new IP ERA provision calls for federal agencies’ inspectors general to annually determine whether their respective agencies are in compliance with key IPERA requirements. Under Office of Management and Budget (OMB) implementing guidance, these reports are required to be completed within 120 days of the publication of the federal agencies’ annual PAR or AFR, with the fiscal year 2011 reports for most agencies due on March 15, 2012. OMB has established guidance for federal agencies on reporting, reducing, and recovering improper payments has established various work groups responsible for developing work groups.and to report on their determinations. The scope for recovery audits to all OMB continues to play a key role in the oversight of the governmentwide improper payments problem. recommendations aimed at improving federal financial management activities related to reducing improper payments. Federal agencies reported improper payment estimates totaling $115.3 billion in fiscal year 2011, a decrease of $5.3billion from 2010. OMB, Circular No. A-136 Revised, Financial Reporting Requirements (Oct. 27, 2011); OMB Memorandum M-11-16, Issuance of Revised Parts I and II to Appendix C of OMB Circular A-123 (Apr. 14, 2011) the revised prior year reported estimate of $120.6 billion. Based on the agencies’ estimates, OMB estimated that fiscal year 2011 improper payments comprised about 4.7 percent of the $2.5 trillion in total spending. The decrease is attributed primarily to decreases in program outlays for the Department of Labor’s Unemployment Insurance program, and decreases in reported error rates for fiscalyear 2011 (compared to fiscal year 2010) OMB estimates improper payments totaled about $120 billion in fiscal year2011. The $115.3 billion in estimated federal improper payments reported for fiscal year 2011 was attributable to 79 programs spread among 17 agencies. Ten of these 79 programs account for most of the reported improper payments. The 10 programs with the highest error rates had rates ranging from 11.0 percent to 28.4 percent. A number of federal agencies have reported progress in reducing improper payment error rates in some programs and activities. The following are examples of agencies that reported reductions in program error rates and estimated improper payment amounts. For fiscal year 2011, OMB reported that governmentwide agencies recaptured $1.25 billion in overpayments to contractors and vendors. Over half of this amount, $797 million, can be attributed to the Medicare recovery audit contractor program which identifies improper Medicare payments in all 50 states. Cumulatively, the President’s goal of recapturing.overall improper payments by $50 billion, and recapture at least $2 billion in improper contract payments by the end of fiscal year 2012. at least $2 billion by the end of fiscal year 2012. Some agencies have not yet reported estimates for all risk-susceptible programs. We have also found that internal control weaknesses exist, heightening the risk of improper payments occurring. Until federal agencies are able to implement effective processes to completely and accurately identify the full extent of the problem, improper payments will continue to be made by the federal government, the report says. The full report is available at: http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/30/politics/federal-government-improper-payments-report-2011-2012. extent of improper payments and implement appropriate corrective actions to effectively reduce improper payments. We found that not all agencies have developed improper payment estimates for all of the programs and activities they identified as susceptible. We are currently working on engagements related to improper payment reporting at both DOD and HHS. Additional analysis is needed to assess the root causes of improper Payments, a key factor in identifying and implementing effective corrective actions. The federal government will not have reasonable assurance that the use of taxpayer funds is adequately safeguarded. Three federal entities did not report fiscal year 2011 estimated improper payment amounts for four risk-susceptible programs. HHS cited statutory limitations for its state-administered Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. Despite these limitations, HHS officials stated that they will continue to work with states and explore options to allow for future estimates for the TANF program. To see the full report, go to: http://www.cnn.com/2011/01/30/healthcare/fiscal-year-2011/federal-financial-reports/index.html. For fiscal year 2011, the TANF program reported outlays of about $17 billion. For another program, HHS cited the Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 as prohibiting HHS from calculating or publishing any national or state- specific payment error rates. The new payment error rate measurement rule became effective on September 10, 2010. According to its fiscalyear 2011 agency financial report, HHS plans to report estimated improper payment amounts for CHIP in fiscal year 2012. For fiscal year2011, the CHIP program reported federal outlays in excess of $20 billion. about $9 billion. Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Commercial Payfiscal year 2011 outlays of $368.5 billion and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Commercial Pay with fiscal year 2011 outlay of $30.5billion. DOD reported that improper payment estimates for these programs were based on improper payments detected through various pre-payment and post-payment review processes rather than using methodologies similar to those used for DOD’s. With the exception of DFAS, OMB excluded estimated improper payment amounts for two DOD programs from the governmentwide total. other programs, including statistically valid random sampling or reviewing 100 percent of payments. In its fiscal year 2011 agency financial report, DOD stated that it plans to begin statistical sampling of the Commercial Pay program in fiscal year 2012. Both GAO and the DOD Inspector General (IG) have previously reported on weaknesses in DOD’s payment controls, including weaknesses in its process for assessing the risk of improper payments and reporting estimated amounts. Nonetheless, the DOD Comptroller testified in May 2011 that the agency plans to start statistical sampling in 2012. DOD assessed its commercial payment program as low risk because DOD management has concluded that it had a highly effective pre-payment examination process. That process includes a software tool that tests for potential improper payments before disbursement. However, the DOD IG has reported that the tool had a false positive rate of more than 95 percent and that its use was not standardized across payment systems. The DOD IG reported that DOD’s risk of making improper payments was high and identified deficiencies in DOD's estimate of high-dollar overpayments. For fiscal year 2011, two agency auditors reported on compliance issues with IPIA and IPERA as part of their 2011 financial statement audits. USDA auditors identified noncompliance with the requirements of IPERA regarding the design of program internal controls related to improper payments. HHS estimated an annual amount of improper payments for some of its programs. Until DOD fully and effectively implements astatistically valid estimating process for its commercial payments and addresses the known control deficiencies in its commercial payment processes, the governmentwide improper payment estimates are not complete. risk-susceptible programs, a key requirement of IPIA. The federal government did not report an improper payment estimate for its TANF and CHIP programs for fiscal year 2011. A number of actions are under way across the federal government to help advance improper payment reduction goals. Identifying and analyzing the root causes of improper payments is key to developing effective corrective actions and identifying the source of the problem, the report says. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported noncompliance issues with IPIA for the eighth year in a row. implementing the controls needed to advance the federal government’s efforts to reduce and prevent improper payments. Proactively preventing improper payments increases public confidence in the administration of benefit programs. For considered. program design issues that are a factor in causing improper payments, addressing program design may be an effective preventive strategy. Effective monitoring and reporting can also help detect emerging issues. In addition, agencies can also enhance detective controls to investigate improper payments and overpayments in the federal budget. The federal government has a responsibility to protect the public from improper payments in its benefits programs. Agencies cited a number of causes for the estimated $115.3 billion in reported improper payments. These included insufficient documentation, incorrect computations, changes in program requirements. Information on the root causes of the current improper payment estimates is necessary for agencies to target effective corrective actions and implement preventive measures. For instance, enhancing incentives for grantees, such as state and local governments, could help increase attention to preventing, identifying, and recovering improper payments, the authors say. The authors found that agencies did not use the three categories to classify the types of errors and quantify how many errors can be attributed to them. fiscal year 2011 PARs and AFRs. Together, these programs represented about $46 billion, or 40 percent of the total reported $115 billion in improper payment estimates for fiscal year 2011. The estimated improper payment amounts were spread across the three categories, with documentation and administrative errors being cited most often. We did not calculate the dollar amounts in each category due to the imprecise narratives included in some of the agencies’ reporting of identified causes. Nonetheless, additional analysis regarding the root causes is needed. Many agencies and programs are in the process of implementing preventive controls to avoid improper payments, including overpayments and underpayments. Preventive controls may involve a variety of activities such as upfront validation of eligibility, predictive analytic tests, training programs, and timely resolution of audit findings. Data sharing allows entities that make payments—to contractors, vendors, participants—to share information. Further, addressing program design issues that are a factor in causing improper payments may be an effective preventive strategy to be considered. in benefit programs, and others—to compare information from different sources to help ensure that payments are appropriate. Data sharing can be particularly useful in confirming initial or continuing eligibility of participants in benefit programs. Analyses and reporting on the extent to which agencies are participating in data sharing activities is another important element needed to advance the federal government’s efforts to reduce improper payments. For example, the U.S. Department of Labor (Labor) reported that it had shared data with the Department of Health and Human Services. that its Unemployment Insurance Program utilizes HHS’s National Directory of New Hires Databaseto individuals who claim benefits after returning to work. In June 2011, Labor established the mandatory use of the database for state benefit payment control no later than December 2011. In another case, to address the issue of inaccuracy of self-reported financial income on applications for student aid, the Labor Department issued a program letter that included recommended operating procedures for cross-matching activity. to improve the ability to detect overpayments. Department of Education implemented a 6-month pilot version of an IRS data retrieval tool in January 2010 for its Pell Grant Program. Tool allows student aid applicants and, as needed, parents of applicants to transfer certain tax return information from the IRS directly to Education’s online application. Education reported that nearly 3.5 million students used the data exchange tool, representing approximately 21 percent of the applications submitted for the 2011 - 2012 academic year. Predictive analytic technologies. The analytic technologies used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 requires CMS to use predictive modeling and other analytic techniques. The goal is to identify and to prevent improper payments under the Medicare fee-for-service program.technologies will be used to analyze and identify Medicare provider networks, billing patterns, and beneficiary utilization patterns and detect those that represent a high risk of fraudulent activity. Through such analysis, unusual or suspicious patterns or abnormalities can be identified and used to prioritize additional review of suspicious transactions before payment is made.are examples of preventive techniques that may be useful for other programs. legislation required that contractors selected begin using these technologies on July 1, 2011, in the 10 states identified by CMS as having the highest risk of fraud, waste, or abuse in Medicare fee- for-service payments. Training can be a key element in any effort to prevent improper payments from occurring. This can include both training staff on how to use these technologies and training providers and beneficiaries on how they should use them to prevent fraud. These predictive analytic contractors began using the technologies to screen all fee-for-service claims nationwide prior to payment as of June 30, 2011. how to prevent and detect improper payments and training providers or beneficiaries on program requirements. The Medicaid Integrity Institute, an initiative of CMS’s Medicaid Integrity Group (MIG), trains state-level staff and facilitates networking by sponsoring free workshops for states. The MIG sponsors education programs for providers and beneficiaries, such as for pharmacy providers, to promote best prescribing practices and appropriate prescribing guidelines based on Food and Drug Administration labeling. GAO, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, GAO/AIMD-00-21.3.1 (Washington, D.C: Nov. 1999). Strong preventive controls remain the frontline defense against improper payments. agencies also need effective detection techniques to quickly identify and recover those overpayments that do occur. Detection activities play a significant role not only in identifying improper payments, but also in providing data on why these payments were made and, in turn, highlighting areas that need strengthened prevention controls. For provider enrollment, contribute to improper payments would lend insight to developing effective strategies for enhancing compliance and may identify opportunities for streamlining or changing eligibility or other program requirements. Data mining is a computer-based control activity that analyzes diverse data. The central repository of data commonly used to perform data mining is called a data warehouse. Data warehouses store tables of historical and current information that are logically grouped. As a tool in managing improper payments, applying data mining to aData warehouse allows an organization to efficiently query the system to identify potential improper payments. For more information on data mining, visit datamining.considered.com or go to www.datamining.com. example, in the Medicare and Medicaid program, data on claims are stored in geographically disbursed systems and databases. CMS has been working for most of the past decade to consolidate program integrity data and analytical tools for detecting fraud, waste, and abuse. The agency’s efforts led to the initiation of the Integrated Data Repository (IDR) program, which is intended to provide CMS and its program integrity contractors with a centralized source that contains Medicaid and Medicare data from the many disparate and dispersed legacy systems. the One Program Integrity (One PI) program, a web-based portal and set of analytical tools by which these data can be accessed and analyzed. Recovery auditing is used to identify and recover overpayments. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 required CMS to implement a national Medicare recovery audit contractor (RAC) program by January 1, 2010. In fiscal year 2011, HHS reported that the Medicare Fee-for-Service recovery audit program identified more than $1 billion in improper payments. $961 million in overpayments and recovered $797 million nationwide. The Medicaid RAC program was established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Each state must contract with a RAC, which is tasked with identifying and recovering Medicaid over payments and identifying underpayments. Similar to the Medicare RACs, Medicaid Racs will be paid on a contingency fee basis—a percentage of any recovered over Payments plus incentive payments for the detection of under payments. It is important to note that some agencies have reported statutory or regulatory problems. Barriers that affect their ability to pursue recovery auditing. Only the Social Security Administration, Railroad Retirement Board, and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs may receive the information necessary to identify the withdrawer. OPM reported that based on current law and Treasury’s regulations, financial institutions are barred from providing OPM with the information needed to recover various overpayments. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) reported that it faces regulatory barriers that restrict its ability to recover over payments for its Retirement Program. in the law to receive that type of information from financial institutions. Treasury has drafted language to address the issue and is working to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend its regulation. In another instance, USDA reported that Section 281 of the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 precluded the use of recovery auditing techniques. Section 281 provides that 90 days after the decision of a state, county, or an area committee is final, no action may be taken to recover the amounts found to have been erroneously disbursed. the decision unless the participant had reason to believe that the decision was erroneous. This statute is commonly referred to as the Finality Rule. Federal-state incentives. Another area for further exploration is the broader use of incentives for states to implement effective preventive and detective controls. Agencies have applied limited incentives and penalties for encouraging improved state administration to reduce improper payments. Incentives and penalties can be helpful to create management reform and to ensure adherence to performance standards. Chairman Platts and Ranking Member Towns, this completes my prepared statement.

Summary:
From fiscal year 1991 through fiscal year 2022, the Army plans to purchase 85,488 FMTV trucks. The Army used a streamlined acquisition strategy to reduce the time required to develop and field FMTV vehicles. Army did not execute a low-risk acquisition strategy, authors say. The contract contained an aggressive production schedule that did not take into account the contractor’s inexperience, they say. They recommend that the Army include safeguards in follow-on production contracts so that it does not repeat errors. Production qualification testing was originally scheduled to be completed in August 1993. The trucks failed the test because they did not meet reliability and some performance requirements. The Army identified over 90 problems that the contractor was required to correct. The contractor had to stop new production for 5 months and produced only 175 new trucks during the other 4 months. About 1,474 trucks had to be disassembled to their frames and remanufactured. The first unit was not equipped with FMTV trucks until January 1996, 2 years and 3 months later than planned. of the contract. The Army planned to recompete a new multiyear FMTV production contract in fiscal year 1998. The Congress, in reviewing the Army’s fiscal year 1996 budget request, did not support the termination. Since this was not enough to fully fund the final year of the contract, the Army and the contractor agreed to extend the FMTV contract 2 years, ending in December 1998. We estimate that as of December 31, 1997 the Army may have incurred an additional $22 million to operate the older trucks. The FMTV production contract specifies that FMTV trucks be designed so that corrosion will not perforate or cause other damage. The contract also specifies the procedures to be used to test the 10-year corrosion protection. The FMTV project office first became aware of corrosion problems in late 1995, when a truck was found corroded through the sheet metal of its cab. The truck was less than 3 years old and was among those stored at the plant awaiting modification. The contractor and the contractor and The Army surveyed all of the trucks in storage and discovered corrosion on other truck cabs. They determined that the main causes of the corrosion were inadequate cleaning and painting procedures by the cab subcontractor, McLaughlin Body Company. McLaughlin subsequently improved its procedures at no cost to the Army. These improvements would be reflected in trucks produced after February 28, 1997. On January 19, 1996, the Army agreed to accept trucks with cabs produced before McLaughlin improve its procedures if Stewart & Stevenson repaired or replaced cabs that showed corrosion. cabs to verify the repairs, and (3) agreed to repair or replace the older cabs if corrosion appeared on them within 5 years. Pending its approval of the contractor’s corrective action plan, the Army withheld $1,000 or $2,000 per truck, depending on type. Both contractor and Army project officials said that the Army had not accepted these trucks and therefore could have required the contractor to replace all the cabs on all the trucks already produced or in various stages of production before McLaughlin improved its processes. The Army’s decision to award a $1.2-billion FMTV contract to a company that was not experienced in truck production, did not have truck production facilities, and was not affiliated with an experienced producer. The Army changed the final year of the 5-year FMTV production program when Congress provided additional funding to continue the program. The contract added an estimated $85 million to the original contract price when the first 4,955 trucks produced did not meet the corrosion protection requirements. For early historical data, we had to rely mainly on oral testimony because many documents dealing with the early program were unavailable. To determine the impact of delays in delivering FMTV trucks, we calculated additional operating and support costs the Army might have incurred as of December 31, 1997. We did not independently verify the accuracy of material receiving and shipping report data obtained from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, but we corroborated its accuracy with another database that used the same original source documentation. We then computed the difference between the cost for the older and theFMTV trucks. than 400 systems deployed in tactical units. Army estimated that it would cost $18.5 million to replace all of the cabs on trucks covered by the warranty. The Army used a replacement cost of $8,000 per air drop cab and $6,000 each for standard cab to develop its estimate. It bases its estimate on 2,864 trucks that it thought would be covered, not 4,955 trucks that actually are covered. We were not able to reach the Army for comment. not able to determine the number of air drop and standard trucks in the 2,091 trucks not included in the Army’s estimate. To produce a conservative estimate of the potential total cost to replace all the cabs, we multiplied the standard cab cost of $6,000 per truck. We performed our work at Defense and Army Headquarters, Washington, D.C., Defense Contract Management Command Headquarters, Fort Belvoir, Virginia and Medium Tactical Vehicle Project Office, Warren, Michigan. We conducted our review between July 1997 and November 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Summary:
The Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-226) placed annual ceilings on executive branch full-time equivalent (FTE) positions. To help accomplish this downsizing, the act allowed non-Department of Defense (DOD) executive branch agencies to pay buyouts to employees who agreed to resign, retire, or take voluntary early retirement. DOD was responsible for about 71 percent of these buyouts. The federal workforce is being reduced at a faster pace than was called for by the act.

Summary:
Using TRLs we developed for these technologies, we found consensus among stakeholders that CCS is less mature than efficiency technologies. We found that DOE’s Office of Fossil Energy does not systematically assess the maturity of key coal technologies as they progress toward commercialization. The lack of such benchmarks or an assessment of the maturity and whether they are achieving planned or desired results limits the ability of DOE to provide a clear picture of these technologies to policymakers, the authors say. The authors say the lack of benchmarks limits DOE's ability to provide an accurate picture to policymakers. utilities officials, and others; congressional and other oversight of the hundreds of millions of dollars DOE is spending on these technologies; and policymakers’ ability to assess the maturity of CCS and the resources that might be needed to achieve commercial deployment. Other agencies similarly charged with developing technologies, such as NASA and the Department of Defense (DOD), use TRLs to characterize the mature of technologies. Table 1 shows a description ofTRLs used by NASA. The agency recently issued a TRL that can play a key role in assessing the maturity in the contracting process. Technology Readiness Assessment Guide lays out three key steps to conducting technology readiness assessments during the contracting process. Although use of the Guide is not mandatory, DOE’s Office of Environmental Management uses the Guide as part of managing its procurement activities. The Office of Nuclear Energy has begun using TRLs to measure and communicate risks associated with nuclear technology. The Guide is a result of a GAO recommendation and is available for download on the Department of Energy's website at: http://www.doe.gov/technologyreadinessassessment. with using critical technologies in a novel way. National Nuclear Security Administration has used TRLs recently as well. In the absence of an assessment from DOE, we asked stakeholders to gauge the maturity of coal technologies using a scale we developed based onTRLs. For example, a number of ultrasupercritical plants ranging from 600 to more than 1,000 MW have been built or are under construction in the U.S. However, this plant does not produce electricity. plants have already been demonstrated commercially. Commercial deployment of CCS within 10 to 15 years is possible according to DOE and other stakeholders. Many technologies to improve plant efficiency have been used and are available for commercial use now, but still face challenges. There are five IGCC plants in operation around the world, including two in the U.S.Europe and Asia, and there are four IGCCs in operation in North America and two in South America. Injections of hazardous wastes, industrial nonhazardous wastes, municipal wastewater can be permitted as Class I or Class V wells. Well operators will only be liable under the SDWA if they violate or fail to comply with EPA orders in situations where an imminent and substantial endangerment to health is posed by a contaminant that is in or likely to enter an underground source of drinking water. EPA plans to finalize the geologic sequestration rule in fall. The rule will apply to well operators who meet all the closure and post-closure requirements and EPA approves site closure of the well. In the U.S., the rule applies to wells that have been in operation for at least five years. Neither the proposed rule nor the final rule will address liability for unintended releases of stored CO emissions in lieu of more efficient coal plants. Some higher efficiency plant designs also face technical challenges in that they require more advanced materials than are currently available. For example, “advanced” ultrasupercritical plants require development of metal alloys to withstand steam temperatures that could be 300 to 500 degrees Fahrenheit higher than today’s ultrasu percritical plants. Most stakeholders reported that making efficiency upgrades to the existing fleet of coal power plants was limited by legal issues. the prospect of triggering the Clean Air Act’s New Source Review (NSR) requirements. Technologies to improve plant efficiency offer potential near-term reductions, but also raise some concerns. According to key reports and stakeholders, the successful deployment of CCS technologies is critical to helping the United States meet potential Limits to Emissions. The U.S. is the largest producer of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the world, followed by Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands. IEA estimated that CCS technologies could meet 20 percent of reductions needed to reduce global CO. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) researchers called CCS the “critical enabling technology” to reduce CO emissions while allowing continued use of coal in the future. In 2009, NAS reported that if C CS technologies are not demonstrated commercially in the next decade, the electricity sector could move more.in greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, CCS could allow coal to remain part of the nation’s diverse fuel mix. Most stakeholders told us that CCS would increase electricity prices, and key reports raise similar concerns. MIT estimated that plants with post-combustion capture have 61 percent higher cost of electricity. DOE has also raised concerns about CCS and water consumption. Some utility officials also said CCS could lead to a decline in the ability of individual plants to operate reliably because a power plant might need to shut down if any of the three components (capture, transport, and storage) of CCS became unavailable. electricity sources would need to make up for the higher parasitic load associated with CCS. The National Coal Council has also reported temporary declines in reliability during past deployments of new coal technologies. We provided a draft of our report to the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of EPA for review and comment. We received written comments from DOE’s Assistant Secretary of the Office of Fossil Energy, which are reproduced in appendix III. We also provided selected slides on reliability of electricity supply to NERC for comment. Assistant Secretary concurred with our recommendation, stating that DOE could improve its process for providing a clearer picture of technology maturity. EPA and NERC provided technical comments, which we have incorporated as appropriate. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies of the report to the offices of the Assistant Secretary for Energy and the Secretary of the Department of Energy. this report to the appropriate congressional committees, Secretary of Energy, Administrator of EPA, and other interested parties. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on GAO’s Web site at http://www.gao.gov. all U.S. emissions of COCO2 is the most prevalent greenhouse gas (GHG) program. If you or your staffs have any questions regarding this report, please contact me at (202) 512-3841. and interviewed senior DOE staff on these Visited coal power plants and research facilities in three selected states—AL, MD, and WV4 We conducted this performance audit from July 2009 through May 2010, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We selected this nonprobability sample of states because they contained a large number of coal-fired power plants, research facilities and other facilities. projects involving advanced coal technologies. To identify stakeholders’ views on these technologies, we conducted initial scoping interviews with power plant operators, technology vendors, and federal officials. We selected a group of 19 stakeholders with expertise in carbon capture and storage (CCS) or technologies to participate in the project. We reviewed key reports including those from the Department of Energy’s (DOE) national laboratories, the National Academy of Sciences, International Energy Agency (IEA), Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Global CCS Institute. improve coal plant efficiency and asked them a set of standard questions. This group of stakeholders included representatives from major utilities that are planning or implementing projects that use these technologies. During these interviews, we asked stakeholders to describe the maturity of technologies in terms of a scale we developed, based on Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) TRLs are a tool developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and used by the U.S. Department of Energy to assess the readiness of technologies. The TRLs are used by various federal agencies to rate the extent to which technologies have been demonstrated to work as intended using a scale of 1 to 9. We consulted with the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), which had recently used a similar approach to examine the maturity of coal technologies. For example, EPRI defined TRL 8 as demonstration at more than 25 percent the size of a commercial scale plant. We applied these benchmarks to a coal power plant and came up with the TRL. commercial scale power plant, which we defined as 500 megawatts (MW) and emitting about 3 millions tons of carbon dioxide (CO) annually. We based this definition on some of the key reports we reviewed, which used 500 MW as a standard power plant. Such a plant would emit about 3 million tons of CO emissions from a power plant can vary based on a variety of factors. We also reviewed available data on the use of key coal technologies compiled by IEA and the Global CCS. GAO responds to Department of Energy's letter dated June 4, 2010.

Summary:
The Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) is being considered for reauthorization. Title IV of the act authorizes the major federal student aid programs. In FY2003, the federal student loan programs provided $45.8 billion in new loans tostudents and their parents. This report discusses issues concerning theStudent loan programs that are likely to be considered during reauthorisation. The report is organized in the following manner. First it discusses the issues that may be considered when the HEA is reauthorized. provides background informationon the student loan programs and their loans. Then it provides an overview of many of the issueslikely to receive attention in the reauthorization. The federal government operates two majorStudent Loan Programs. These programs provide loansto undergraduate and graduate students and the parents of undergraduate students to help them meet the costs of postsecondary education. Under the FFEL program, loan capital is used to help students pay for their education. The WilliamD. Ford Direct Loan (DL) program is authorized by Part D of Title IV of the HEA. provided by private lenders, and the federalgovernment guarantees lenders against loss through borrower default, death, permanent disability,or, in limited instances, bankruptcy. Under the DL program, operated through the U.S. Departmentof Education, the federal government provides the loans to students and their families. The two programs rely on different sources ofcapital and different administrative structures, but essentially disburse the same set of loans. The DL program was intended to streamline the student loan deliverysystem and achieve cost savings. replace the long-standing FFEL program, the 1998 HEA amendments removed theprovisions of the law that referred to a "phase in" of the DL program. Currently both programs areauthorized and the two programs compete for student loan business. In FY2003, these programsprovided $45.8 billion in new loans to students and their parents. In that year the FFEL programprovided 8,429,000 new loans averaging about $4,009 each. The DL program provided2,937,000new loans averaging approximately $4,.075 each. to undergraduate and graduate students. The interest rates onsubsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans adjust annually, based on a statutorily established,market-indexed, rate setting formula, and may not exceed 8.25%. To qualify for a subsidized Stafford loan, astudent must establish financial need. The federal government pays the interest on the borrower'sbehalf on the subsidized Stafford loans while the borrower is in school (on at least a half-time basis)and during grace periods and deferment periods. Consolidation loans enable borrowers to lower monthly payments by extending the repayment period. A consolidation loan may be comprised of one underlying loan or multipleunderlying loans. Consolidation loans afford borrowers the opportunity to pursue a more favorable long term interestrate through locking in a fixed interest rate on their student loans, based on the weighted average ofthe interest rates in effect on the loans being consolidated rounded up to the nearest one-eighth.not exceed 9%. The average interest rate for a consolidation loan is 1.9%. of1%, capped at 8.25%. (4) It is generally thecase that enhancements to borrower benefits increase federal subsidy costs. For instance, in theFFEL program, where the government insures and subsidizes loans made by private lenders, federalsubsidy costs increase when less revenue is derived from borrower fees and when interest subsidypayments to lenders are increased. (5) There are underlying tensions inherent in the current design of the loan programs that affect many of the reauthorization issues considered in this report. ensures they receive the difference between the statutorily set borrower rate and a fair market rate. In the DL program,where the government acts as lender, federal subsidy costs are increased when borrower fees orrepayment revenues paid to the government are reduced. Another tension stems from dissimilarities in FFEL and DL program loan terms andconditions. The two programs disburse the same set of loans, but terms and conditions are notperfectly parallel across the two programs. Each program has its supporters. As of July 2006, new Stafford and PLUS loans will carry fixed interest rates. The desirability of thisplanned switch has been the subject of considerable debate. Student loan interest rates were a focal issue in the 1998 reauthorization. The statutory ratesetting formulas were used to establish rates for loans disbursed from July 1, 1998 through June 30, 2006. They were initially enacted in June 1998 and extended in the HEA amendments of June 2000. They are used to set rates for Stafford and Plus loans. The current rate setting formulas were adopted as a result of deliberations that centered on replacing so called "comparable maturity rates" that were set to take effect July 1, 1998. The formula for calculating interest rates on Stafford loans is based on the 91-day Treasury bill rate plus 1.7% while the borrower is in school. Stafford rates are capped at 8.25%. The formula in effect for calculatingInterest rates on PLUS loans isbased on the 90-day treasury bill rate and 3.1% PLUS rates are caps at 9%. rate-setting formula was initially enacted in the Student Loan Reform Act of 1993. The formula afforded the Secretary of Education a great deal of latitude in establishing borrower rates. The decision to move toward a comparable maturity rate was made in 1993 within thecontext of the assumption that the DL program would be phased in over a series of years and eventually replace the guaranteed loan system. (7) In years following the enactment of the SLRA,Congressional support emerged for sustaining both loan programs and, within this context,considerable attention was devoted to replacing the comparable maturity. rate structure before it tookeffect. This led to the adoption of the rate setting formulas currently in effect. However, due to costconsiderations under prevailing budget scoring rules, the HEA amendments of 1998 were only able to install the current formula until June 30, 2003. The interest rate issue was revisited in 2002 with the passage of P.L. 107-139. This measureextended the existing variable rate setting formula through June 30,. 2006. Additionally, it installedfixed interest rates of 6.8% for Stafford loans and 7.9% for PLUS loans disbursed thereafter. It is likely that student loan interest rates will be hotly debated. Part of the debate is likely to focus on enhancing or preserving borrower benefits. Several proposals have beenforwarded recently that call for reductions in borrower fees. In FY2003,borrower origination fees generated approximately $1.3 billion in revenue across the two programs. To limit the federal government'ssubsidy costs, and to limit the amount of debt incurred by borrowers, annual and aggregate Stafford loan caps have been established. finance their studies. In general, those in favor of expanding loan limits suggest loan limits have not kept pace withtuition increases and thus constrain students' ability to finance their education. Those opposed suggest it is undesirable for students to incurmore debt, and question whether the expansion of borrowing opportunities will have any positiveeffect on access, choice or persistence. Also at issue arefederal subsidy costs, because as borrowing opportunities are expanded so are federal subsidy costs. Repayment Plans. Issues concerning repaymentplans that surface with some regularity relate to differences All FFEL borrowers are allowed to choose among standard, graduated, and income sensitiverepayment plans. For new borrowers on or after October 7, 1998, who accumulate (after such date)outstanding loans totaling more than $30,000, a fourth repayment option is available -- an extended repayment plan. All DL borrowers are able to choose between standard and graduated repayment plans. In addition, all DL borrowers can choose extended repayments of up to five years. For more information on the FFEL and DL programs, visit the FFel website. repayment (thereare no restrictions similar to those in FFEL) Income contingent repayment (as opposed to incomesensitive repayment) is available to all DL unsubsidized and subsidized Stafford borrowers. In FFEL, all repayment plans offer a 10-year repayment term with the exception of extended repayment under which repayment must occur within a time period not toexceed 25 years. In DL, standard repayment offers a10-year term. Under the income contingent repayment plan, repayment must be made over a period of time not to exceed 25years. periods for extended and graduated repayment plans vary with the size of the loan. It is likely that some attention may be devoted to adopting more comparable repaymentoptions across the two programs. Some interest exists in adding a new "interest only"repayment option. Under such an option, a borrower would have low "interest-only" payments intheir initial years after graduation, but would also delay the point at which they begin paying downloan principal. In general, the debate pertaining to the fixed rate on consolidation loans is more about interest rates. benefit centers on its cost. As the consolidation loan interest rate formula has been modified byCongress, consolidation loans have evolved into a refinance benefit as well. The current consolidation loaninterest rate formula affords borrowers the opportunity tosecure a fixed rate equal to the weighted average interest rate on the loans at the time of origination. It also enables a borrower to pursue a better interest rate than the current weighted averageinterest rate on loans at origination of $1.5 million. It was originally intended to simplify repayment for borrowers and simplify loan repayments. average of the rates in effect on underlying (variable rate)loans being consolidated rounded up to the nearest one eighth of 1%. In the recent low interest rateenvironment consolidation volume has grown dramatically. Over the last two years, in which very lowrates have been available, an estimated $63 billion in loan volume has been taken out. This has enabled a largenumber of borrowers to secure a valuable refinance benefit. Currently, a borrower who consolidateswhile in the grace period can secure a 2.88% interest rate. consolidated. Whenborrowers exercise their option to lock in low rates permanently the federal government is potentiallyexposed to high subsidy costs. In the FFEL program, this is so because the government hasguaranteed the lenders a market rate of return. Those in favor of the existing fixed rate setting formula assert that in the current low interestrate environment the fixed rate amounts to a valuable benefit to borrowers. At a time of low interest rates, fixed rates are a good thing. Proponents of the existing rate setting formulas say it provides important repayment relief and sends a signal to students and potentialstudents that repayment will be manageable. Opponents say eliminating the opportunity to lock in a fixed rate would be tantamount to taking away a benefit that was available when borrowers received their Stafford loans. The removal of this benefit in a low interest environment would amount to dropping a large share of the interest subsidy currently available to borrowers. Those opposed to sustaining theexisting rate setting formula suggest it would be detrimental to the economy. offers an overlygenerous borrower benefit that is costly to the point of placing future aid in jeopardy. They alsoquestion whether it is necessary to offer a refinance benefit when the rate is already subsidized onStafford loans. Further they question whether a benefit received in the years after postsecondaryschooling contributes in any way to students' postsecondary access, persistence, or choice. They notethe repayment period subsidy is provided without regard to need, over a lengthy period potentiallyextending up to 30 years beyond schooling, and disproportionately benefits students who attendedfour-year private institutions and/or graduate programs. an extension of the debate on the fixed rate benefit. Borrowers who have lockedin fixed rates through consolidation in high interest periods sometimes miss out on moreadvantageous variable rates. Some borrowers fare worse under the high fixed ratesthey lock in. This raises concern, particularly with regard to those using consolidation for repaymentrelief (i.e., extended repayment) One way to address this situation is through offering borrowers borrowers fixed rates on variable-rate loans instead offixed rates on fixed rates. Multiple refinanceopportunities (i.e., offering borrowers with relatively high fixed rates the prospect of securing abetter rate) Any added interest benefit for a borrower, however, would likely expand federal subsidycosts. Another way to address this is to eliminate consolidation loans' fixed rate benefit. Thiswould prevent borrowers from locking in disadvantageous rates in the future, but would not offerassistance to those having already done so. (11) A complex set of provisions has been enacted to regulate competition for consolidation loan refinance business among loan holders within the FFEL program. a consolidation loan through FFELlenders, or that they are unable to secure a FFEL consolidation loan with income sensitive repaymentterms (deemed to be acceptable by the borrower) DL borrowers may pursue consolidation loans within the DL program. It is likely that proposals calling for the elimination of provisions that constrain borrowers'choice among consolidators will receive consideration during reauthorization. Some FFEL lenders object to making a change in this area, asserting they offersome up front discounts on Stafford and PLUS loans based on the assumption they will be able tohold the loan over its life. Borrowers with less than $7,500 in outstanding loans seeking toconsolidate in FFEL may receive a maximum repayment term of 10 years. Married persons, each of whom has eligible loans, are eligible for a joint consolidation loan. Borrowers can lockin as permanent an in-school rate which is lower than the repayment rate (T-bill + 1.7% as opposed to T-bill -2.3%). This affords borrowers greater opportunity to lock in as permanent favorablevariable rates in effect in years when the borrowers are still in school. one of the borrowers mustmeet the full set of individual eligibility requirements for a new consolidation loan. However, eachagrees to become jointly and severally liable for repayment of the note regardless of any changes inmarital status. It is likely that proposals to eliminate joint consolidations will receive consideration in the reauthorization. While joint consolidation can simplify repayment for a married couple, concerns have beenraised in recent years about disadvantages that may be associated with joint consolidation for someborrowers. For instance, borrowers with a joint consolidation loan must both meet the requirementsfor a deferment or forbearance in order to receive those benefits. Had the loans not been joined, eachborrower could qualify for these benefits based upon their own status. Concerns have been raised about complications that may ensue for unsuccessful marriages given that both partiesagree to be liable for the total repayment of the joint consolidation loan. Also, in instances involving a spouse who becomes permanently disabled, a disability discharge is provided for that spouse but each spouse remains liable for repayment of remaining loan amount. Guaranty agenciesadminister the federal government's loan guarantee. The role guarantors play within the FFELprogram has evolved a good deal since the program's inception. Initially, the federal governmentintended to encourage the growth of state loan insurance programs. Over time the federalgovernment assumed the role of providing the insurance and now guaranty agencies service the federal guarantee and perform various program administrative tasks. Changes adopted during the 1998 reauthorization focused on strengthening therelationship between revenues and activities, and improving efficiency. The 1998 amendments adopted a "risk-based" approach to the FFEL program, with the aim of making it more efficient. sharing" approach. Under this approach, uses ofreserves are restricted, and guarantors are afforded flexibility in the use of their operating funds. There is a clearer distinction between reserves and operating funds, and clearer direction about wherevarious revenue streams are to be deposited -- and ultimately about how these sources of revenueare to be used. It is likely that some attention will be devoted to the issue of how the federal government will manage its reserves in the event of an economic downturn in the U.S. solvency of Federal Funds (i.e., locallyheld federal reserve funds) and the size of Operating Funds -- which can be used to support agencyoperations and also for discretionary student financial aid expenditures. Some concerns have been raised aboutshrinking reserves and robust Operating Funds. Some proposals have already called for mandatinginsurance premiums to strengthen reserves. Some observers have suggested guarantor fees for loancollections and defaulted loan rehabilitation work may be too high thus inflating operating funds. loan subsidy known as a special allowance payment(SAP) The SAP amount is determined on a quarterly basis by a statutory formula which is tied to a financial index. The SAP is designed to compensate lenders for the difference between the below-market,statutorily set interest rate charged to borrowers and a market set interest rates that is intended as fairmarket compensation on the loan asset. In some instances lenders receive interest income from borrowers exceeding the amountcalled for by the SAP calculation. The amount of income lenders receive above the government SAPrate is often called "floor income" The SAP affords lenders necessary protection in high interest environments during which thestatutorily established borrower rate may provide lenders insufficient below-market rate returns. Some argue that since the SAP is designed to approximate fair market compensation it isunnecessary to compensate lenders at levels that exceed the SAP rate. It is often noted that in anearlier period, "excess interest provisions" were adopted that essentially installed the SAP in the system. SAP rate as thesole lender reimbursement rate for loans. Some FFEL program loans provide lenders a guaranteed interest rate of atleast 9.5% (hereafter, these loans are referred to as 9. 5% floor loans). This guarantee is provided inthe SAP formula applied to these loans, which requires the federal government to supplementborrower interest payments. Several recent proposals have called for reducing federalsubsidy costs by establishing the SAP rate asThe SAP rate is the sole lender reimbursed rate. for lenders. There seems to bebroad Congressional support for curbing this rate guarantee for future loans. The legislativedevelopments that led to the enactment of the guarantee are briefly described below. As part of an effort to ensure the FFEL program would be fully capitalized in the program'searly years, provisions that served to encourage the issuance of tax-exempt student loan bonds were included in the Tax Reform Act of 1976. Such bonds are exempt from federal taxation, and are usedby states to finance below market interest rate loans for students. state authorities are able to raise "low cost"funds, and then re-lend the funds at higher rates. The 1980 HEA amendmentstook steps to curb the profitability of tax-exempt loans by reducing by half the SAP rate on loans. The amendments also established minimum SAPs,for loans disbursed on or after October 1, 1980, which ensure a minimum return of $1,000,000. The student bond volume began to grow rapidly, andconcerns about the profits of tax exempt student loans surfaced. 9.5% on theseloans. (16) The discourse on the profitability of tax-exempt student loans continued through the 1980son into the early 1990s. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ( P.L. 103-66 ) contained a provision eliminating the floor on tax- exempt loans supported through tax- exempted financing forissuances on or after October 1, 1993. These loans were afforded the same SAP rates as wereavailable for taxable loans. 9.5% floor loans comprise a relatively small percentage of all outstanding loans. They have accounted for a very large proportion of federal SAP subsidies. In recent years lenders havebeen using a variety of refinancing techniques, and also invested earnings from existing 9. 5% floorloans to make or purchase new ones. There appear to be a number of ways for banks to finance 9.5%, including by using the proceeds from the sale of existing loans and by using earnings from new loans. There is some debate about how best to phase out theguarantee for nonprofit lenders. The Taxpayer-Teacher Protection Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-409 );signed October 30, 2004, curbs growth in 9.5% loans, for one year. It does not curtail the guaranteeon new loans stemming from "recycling"of proceeds from outstanding 9. 5% loans. These loans were issued on orafter October 1, 1980 and prior toOctober 1, 1993. A phase out of the 9.5% guarantee would produce savings in mandatory spending. Thesesavings could be used to offset new expenditures. Proceeds from the sale of the bank would be used for new 9.4% loans. The proceeds from the sales of the Bank of Canada’s stake in the Bank for International Settlements (BOCS) would also be used as a source of funding for the Bank. The BOCS is a joint venture between the BSC and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (BRC).

Summary:
GAO reviewed the process for distributing highway funds to the states. The act provided an unprecedented authorization of $122 billion for highways, bridges, and related activities for fiscal years 1992-97. Funding is funded primarily through federal highway user taxes such as those on motor fuels (gasoline, gasohol, and diesel), tires, and trucks. For other roads eligible for federal assistance, a program with the characteristics of a block grant, the Surface Transportation Program (STP), provides financial assistance. the states’ funding shares for these programs remain fixed over time. The final program included in the four-part calculation—the STP—behaves as an adjuster. This means that any annual increase or decrease in a state’s funding for the Interstate Maintenance Program, Bridge Program, or NHS must be offset by a corresponding, reciprocal change in the STP funds the state receives for that same year. Figure 2.2 illustrates this zero-sum game through a hypothetical example involving 2 years and two states. largest programs—the NHS and STP, together accounting for 40 percent of all the funding apportioned in fiscal year 1995. As we reported in March 1986, the factors that influenced the historical targets for funding in the federal-aid highway program are not closely related to the highway system’s needs. Alternative factors, such as lane miles and annual contributions to the Highway Trust Fund, are more closely aligned with highway needs, according to our March 1986 report and an FHWA-sponsored study. March 1986 report, we found that the factors used to apportion certain highway funds were not closely related to the highway system. At the time of our report, the data on which these factors were based were already between 40 and 70 years old. A state’s land area was originally included as a factor in the distribution formula in 1916. Land area was thought to provide a balance for the factor based on population and to reflect a state's future highway needs. However, this approach resulted Postal mileage was included as a formula factor in 1916 to provide a constitutional justification for federal involvement in highways. By 1919, changes to the highway legislation had ended the need for this justification. Land area no longer bears a close relationship to future highway needs, namely need for new construction, since the highway system is no longer growing rapidly throughout the country. In addition, since postal mileage is computed on the basis of the postal mileage, land area is not a factor in the formula factor for land area. Population figures for formula use were derived every 10 years from the census. As a result, changes in the states’ populations were accounted for only at 10-year intervals. This problem has been exacerbated under ISTEA, since the population data underlying the states' historical shares for ISTEA’s major funding calculations are, in part, based on 1980 population data, not the more current 1990 data. In our March 1986 report, we also identified those factors previously and identified those that are still relevant today. suggested to the Congress as consistent with basic federal highway programs and for which data were available. Our results supported lane miles as a direct measure of the size of the road network and thus as a reflection of the extent of the system to be preserved. In addition, we found that vehicle miles traveled and motor fuel consumption reflected the amount of highway use. We recognized that each of these factors has its own advantages and disadvantages in establishing a formula. Finally, we recognized that changing the formula could have a negative effect on the safety of the highway system. the factors used in certain highway apportionment formulas would result in some states’ receiving more or less funds than they did under the then-current formulas. We suggested that to lessen these impacts, a transition period could be provided during which the full effect of the formulas would be gradually introduced. However, the Congress elected not to change the basic formula structure. In December 1986, Jack Faucett Associates, a consultant for FHWA, issued a report evaluating alternative apportionments formulas for highway funds. of vehicle miles traveled on the Interstate would also have a high requirement for repairs to the Interstate. Similarly, the states that contributed large amounts of revenue to the Highway Trust Fund, reflecting substantial use of motor fuels, were also shown to require more repairs. The correlation analysis was reported in terms of values between zero and one. The closer the value is to 1, the closer the correlation between the factor and the need for repairs. For more information, visit the U.S. Department of Transportation’s website. The highest correlations—at least 0.900—existed for vehicle miles traveled and annual contributions to the Highway Trust Fund. This was not the case, however, for weather-related variables or per capita income. Equity adjustments were designed to address the concerns of the states that contribute a greater share of the Highway Fund's funds. The findings were published in the Journal of the American Highway and Transportation Association's 2014 State of the U.S. Highway System report, which is available online at http://www.reported.com/state-of-the-u. The three equity adjustment categories address the concerns of those states that contribute more in highway user taxes than they receive in federal-aid highway funds. The Minimum Allocation guarantees a state an amount such that its percentage of the total apportionments and prior-year allocations from certain highway funding categories is not less than 90 percent. The 90 Percent of Payments Adjustment provides each state with the same relative share of overall funding that it received in the past. The Donor State Bonus provides a bonus to states that give more to the federal government. The 90 Percent of Payments Adjustment ensures a state that selected apportionments for the fiscal year and allocations in the previous fiscal year will equal at least 90 percent of its contributions to the Highway Trust Fund’s Highway Account. The Donor State Bonus, as implemented by FHWA, compares each state's projected contributions with the apportionment that the state will receive in that fiscal year. Starting with the state having the lowest return (apportionments compared with contributions), each state is given a bonus. is brought up to the level of return for those states with the next highest level of returns. This process is repeated successively for each state until the funds authorized for this funding category in that fiscal year are exhausted. Finally, a fourth adjustment category, referred to as Hold Harmless, addresses a different objective—preserving the states’ historical funding share. For example, this legislatively prescribed funding percentage is 1.74 for Alabama, 0.41 for Delaware and 0.69 for Idaho. The calculations that determine the level of funding that each state receives for the various funding categories occur in a strict sequence. All of the equity adjustments come into play late in the sequential calculation. These adjustments essentially increase the funding calculated for a state up to that point. For example, if a state is hypothetically entitled to a total apportionment of of Illinois, and 4.36 for Massachusetts, these adjustments increase the state’s total funding to that amount by 1.5%. This is the case for Illinois. $500 million on the basis of the Hold Harmless provision, it will receive that amount regardless of whether all the calculations up to that point yielded a total of $200 million, $300 million, or $400 million. In fiscal year 1995, equity adjustments accounted for $2.8 billion (16 percent) of the approximately $18 billion distributed to the states. Only nine states—Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia, and Washington—and Puerto Rico did not receive funding through equity adjustments. the basis of the funding for the programs alone. For the other 41 states and the District of Columbia, the total amount of federal highway funding apportioned in fiscal year 1995 was ultimately increased by equity adjustments. Funding for demonstration projects is distinct from apportionments to the states in that the authorized funding for such projects is not distributed by formula. Rather, the Congress directs how certain funds are to be distributed by requiring that particular projects receive a specified amount of funding. The Congress has jurisdiction over highway appropriations and authorizations. The amount of federal funds authorized for demonstration projects has grown since 1982. ISTEA alone authorized over $6.2 billion over 6 years for 539 demonstration projects. As we noted in a 1991 report and testimony in 1993 and 1995, demonstration projects often cost more than expected. In our 1991 report, we found that for 66 projects reviewed, the federal funding and state matching funds together accounted for more than $1 billion for each of the 66 projects. For more information, go to: http://www.transportation.gov/. only 37 percent of the projects’ total anticipated costs. Future finances could be drained if extra federal funds are needed to cover the cost of completing the projects. Demonstration projects can yield a low payoff for a variety of reasons, including that they frequently are not aligned with the states’ transportation priorities. For instance, in our 1991 report, we found that for 22 of the 66 projects reviewed, none of the authorized funds ($92 million) had been obligated, even though the projects had been approved. projects had been authorized 4 years earlier. ISTEA authorized approximately $120 billion for highway construction and repair and related activities over 6 years. Figure 2.3 depicts the funding to each state for highway programs, and, if applicable, any modifications to that funding realized through either equity adjustments or funding for demonstration projects provided under ISTEA in fiscal year 1995. But the factors underlying the distribution of funds for two of the largest projects had not yet been determined. The funds were intended to be used for a variety of highway and mass transit projects. highway programs—the NHS and STP—essentially remained the same. Each state’s funding was to be based on the historical share of funds the state received from major programs before ISTEA was enacted. Locking in the status quo on the basis of historical funding averages has also been supported through two other funding avenues. The Hold Harmless equity adjustment category serves to raise the states’ ultimate level of annual funding to a predetermined percentage share of the total funding available. These percentage shares are fixed over the life of ISTEA. The data underlying the distribution of highway funds to the states are generally outdated, unresponsive to changing conditions, and often not reflective of the nation’s highway system or its usage. Because the percentage share is fixed for the four largest programs, any updated data that are factored into the calculation for two of these programs are negated. On the basis of our analysis and discussions with federal and state officials, we believe that the federal government should increase its share of highway funding for the states. state transportation officials, ISTEA’s myriad objectives for highways can be placed into four overarching categories. The first two objectives translate into formula components that are at the core of the distribution process. Addressing the states’ highway needs, such as the miles of highway in need of repair and the deterioration of the highway associated with traffic loads, is a primary objective in the distribution of highway funds. The second objective is returning the majority of funds to the state where the revenue was generated, and the third is fostering social benefits. The second component, calling for a return of funds to the state in which they were generated, supports a congressional objective of having the states receive a substantial return on the federal fuel and other tax receipts that they generate. The third and fourth objectives discussed in this chapter could be met through formula components that would distribute funds set aside from the regular apportionment process. A portion of formula funding could be devoted to social goals by, for example, directing a portion of funding to selected purposes such as improving air quality. New components could be added to recognize the states’ capacity to fund highway needs from state resources. A share of funding could be set aside and used to protect the states' historical funding shares. The task of revising the formula for distributing highway funds will be difficult because needs vary across the country and objectives conflict among themselves. The analysis presented in this report is intended to provide the Congress with formula alternatives that reflect the key objectives governing the current federal-aid highway formula. and conserving energy. Some states believe that center-line miles, not lane miles, are a more appropriate factor for distributing highway funds. A highway that is 2 miles long would equal 2 center- line miles or 8 lane miles. However, this measure does not capture any information on the various widths of highways, because a lane mile is not the same thing as a center line mile. The U.S. Department of Transportation says it will continue to use center line miles for highway funding until a new formula is developed. Lane miles are a good measure of the extent of the highway system (capital stock) to be preserved. Using lane miles as a factor for apportioning highway funds was endorsed by a Policy Review Committee of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) in fiscal year 1991. Two-lane highway and an eight- lane highway are considered equal under this measure. The width and length of highways is reflected in lane miles, and as we noted in our 1986 report, lane miles are an important measure. both rural and urban areas. The committee further noted that a measure of lane miles is probably the simplest and most efficient potential apportionment factor on which to obtain accurate information. Annual data are generally available within 6 to 9 months of the close of the calendar year. Regardless of whether center-line miles or lane miles are used to indicate the extent of a system, some observers criticize the use of mileage for apportioning future highway funds. Such usage could reward expansion of the system. Thus, this type of apportionments factor would tend to encourage more highway. construction, to the possible detriment of adequately preserving the existing network and of considering air quality. Several actions could be taken to counterbalance such tendencies. First, as part of the third component of the formula framework, set-asides could be established to reward those states that meet certain preservation or maintenance goals. Second, greater use of performance measures geared to preserving theexisting infrastructure would help FHWA ensure that the states do not neglect needed preservation and maintenance. As we noted in our July 1994 testimony before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, performance measures are important. A well-maintained system is the necessary foundation for pursuing the myriad goals for the system. Without such a foundation, system enhancements such as alleviating congestion and improving the efficient movement of goods may not be fully realized. While measures of a system’s extent provide part of the story on highway needs, the condition of the road is also an important element. Condition can be captured by measures of the use of the system, as well as by the state of the highway itself. distinct from the extent of the system. The AASHTO Policy Review Committee observed that data on vehicle miles traveled have been statistically designed for a high level of measurable accuracy. Also, in the Faucett study, vehicle miles travel garnered one of the highest correlation values, 0.913, of the other factors used in the formula for a system’s usage. It is relevant as an indicator of both capital and system preservation needs, the committee said. The study was published in the Journal of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. all the factors related to Interstate repair needs. That is, a state with a high number of vehicle miles traveled would also likely have high needs for repair of the Interstate. Motor fuel consumption reflects travel on all roads, not just on the federal-aid system or on roads under a state’s jurisdiction. It would not be a precise measure for apportioning funds to specific groups of roads. These data are reported by states monthly and adjusted at year's end. Annual data are generally available within 6 to 9 months of. Fuel consumption patterns may differ across states because of the urban-rural population mix, the amount of travel done under congested conditions, and fuel purchases by transients in those states with lower fuel taxes. While vehicle miles traveled and motor fuel consumption correlate well with system usage, they do have some drawbacks. Vehicle miles traveled measure the vehicles moved rather than the people and do not account for different vehicle classifications. Both factors are largely at odds with air quality objectives, and the principle of air quality. rewarding motor fuel consumption with more highway funding also conflicts with the goal of encouraging energy conservation. New Jersey transportation officials, for instance, noted that such factors reward energy consumption and air pollution and penalize those who successfully enact measures to reduce the use of single-occupant vehicles. Congress has previously rejected the notion of giving vehicle miles traveled greater weight in apportioning funds, in part because of the strong environmental objections raised. As in the case of the factors related to the system’s extent, the disadvantages associated with measures of are similar. the system’s usage could be at least partially counteracted by building incentives into the formula or by creating appropriate performance standards. A host of other factors—such as population, climatic conditions (daily mean temperature, annual snowfall, and annual precipitation), and per capita income—could also be used to determine how highway funds are distributed. Yet, as the Faucett study demonstrated, a low correlation exists between highway needs as reported by FHWA and climatic variables. The Executive Director of the Surface Transportation Policy Project supports the use of population levels for distributing highway funds. to the extent that the formula uses factors such as vehicle miles traveled, lane miles, and fuel consumption, it encourages behavior that runs counter to the objectives of reducing congestion and improving air quality. In his view, population and population density would be preferable alternatives as proxies. These proxies were recommended because they were perceived as avoiding the perverse effects tied to a system’s extent and usage. Population data, however, also have limitations. As noted by the Executive Director of AASHTO, the link between population and the states’ highway needs is questionable. Funds would be targeted to congested urban areas, the approach would do little to accommodate the needs of rural areas. Some state transportation officials from sparsely populated states believe that much of the traffic that occurs in densely populated areas is local. Officials from these states maintain that the promotion of interstate commerce should be a principal objective of the federal-aid highway program. They say federal funds should target the highways that tend to carry national, not local, traffic. The approach does not recognize that goods produced in sparsely. populated areas ultimately must be transported to dense areas. As we reported in March 1986, factors reflecting a system’s extent and use in isolation do not provide a complete picture on the states’ needs. Introducing neutral factors, such as population, into the formula further diversifies the mix of factors and alters the amounts the states receive. Table 3.1 provides an outline of the factors to be considered in the two alternatives. The first alternative assumes that 100 percent of total needs are met. The second assumes that only a small fraction of the total needs is met. Highway funds are distributed to the states based equally on total lane miles and total vehicle miles traveled. Under this alternative, 13 percent of the overall highway funds would be redistributed. Twenty-three states and Puerto Rico would receive more funds than they were apportioned in fiscal year 1995. The average dollar gain would be $102 million; $643 million would be the high end of the range (California) Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia would receive less funding. (State-by-state details are provided in app. IV.) million (California), and the low end would be $2 million (Nevada). Twenty-four states and the District of Columbia would receive less funding. For these states, the average loss would be  $79 million; the greatest loss would is $359 million (Pennsylvania) (State-by-state details are provided in app. V.) One indicator of need that we intentionally omitted from the above discussion is that of the states’ contributions to the federal Highway Trust Fund. As a formula factor, these contributions have a special status. program. Not only do contributions to the Trust Fund correlate strongly with highway needs, particularly for major highways, but the states’ returns on these contributions have also been considered a key measure of equity. For years, the highway apportionment formula has endorsed, through one or more equity adjustments, the principle that the states ought to receive back a substantial portion of what they deposit. This does not currently occur. If the formula were restructured to encompass a pure return-to-origin approach, each state’s contribution to the trust fund would simply be returned to that state. In 1993, federal highway apportionments as a percentage of the states’ contributions to the Highway Trust Fund’s highway account ranged from 83 percent for South Carolina to 707 percent for Hawaii. Because the majority of revenues credited to the Trust Fund derive from the federal fuel tax, the states' contributions tend to be quite closely linked with fuel consumption. As a potential formula factor, these contributions therefore offer the same kinds of potential formula factors as the federal excise taxes, FHWA says. Some state transportation officials could be expected to support this approach. It would guarantee that all or a substantial amount of the revenues collected in their states would be returned to them. An advantage of returning funds to their source is that contributions to the Highway Trust Fund tend to correlate highly with highway needs, particularly for major highways. However, the return-to-origin approach has advantages and disadvantages as well as fuel consumption does. It is a relatively simple and direct way of distributing these funds. It could be a good idea for the U.S. to return some of its highway funds to the states. approach would not be universally attractive. For instance, those states whose fuel usage is low relative to their land area and extent of highway network would be financially hurt. A prime argument made by officials from these states is that the national interest requires highways to span the wide expanses of large, sparsely populated states. The financial resources of those states are often insufficient to construct, maintain, and operate such networks. Two additional arguments are made against the return-to-origin approach to highway construction. approach. New York transportation officials noted that formulas based on returning contributions to the Trust Fund to the state where they are raised meet neither federal or state transportation goals nor national policy. If the primary goal of federal apportionment formulas is to return revenues from motor fuel taxes to the place they were earned, these officials questioned whether there was a need for a federal program. Second, state officials have questioned the wisdom of selecting a formula factor that is geared predominantly to fuel use. They argue that such an approach rewards greater. use of motor fuel and as such contradicts federal goals of improving air quality and conserving energy. This approach would not necessarily preclude congressional direction of the use of those funds. Legislation could still specify that the returned funds be used in certain proportions for certain programs, such as the NHS. The return could function as (1) a simple return of funds, in which states would be exempt from any or most federal oversight, or (2) a distribution of funds in which FHWA would oversee the programs for which the funds were returned. considered three different alternatives, which are summarized in table 3.2. Under the first alternative, $17.8 billion of the total $19.1 billion would be returned to the source. This amount would represent all the funds distributed to the states in fiscal year 1995, except funds for Interstate Construction. These funds were excluded since the Interstate Construction program’s final apportionment was made at the beginning of fiscal year1995. Under this alternative, 24 states would receive more funds than they would have received otherwise. were apportioned in fiscal year 1995, while the remaining states, along with the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, would lose funds. Under the second alternative, the total amount of funds ($18.1 billion) would be returned, including funds for Interstate Construction funds but excluding those for demonstration projects. The average dollar gain would be $67 million; the average loss would be £58 million. (State-by-state details are presented in app. VI.) The Congress directs how the funds are distributed. The current funding level for the STP represents about 40 percent of the total funds authorized for these programs. The two alternatives outlined in table 3.3 and described below maintain this distribution of funding. While many social objectives are probably best addressed through means other than the highway apportionment formula, a portion of highway funds might nonetheless be retained to advance specific objectives. For instance, a certain percentage of funds—10 percent, for example—could be set aside before the remaining funds were distributed to the states. is the existing Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) program, which directs funds to states with particularly severe problems in air quality. CMAQ is focused on investment in airquality improvements and provides funds for projects that expand or initiate transportation services. It is directed to those states that are classified as nonattainment areas for ozone and carbon monoxide. Every state, regardless of its air quality status, is guaranteed an annual minimum apportionment of 0.5 percent of the program’s program. total funding.) The advantage of such a program is that it focuses funding on precisely those areas with the greatest needs. The disadvantage is that, as occurs with the needs-based formula factors discussed earlier in this chapter, directing funding to states with specific needs can foster a perverse incentive. Questions have been raised about the wisdom of essentially rewarding states for their nonattainment status, particularly given that a state loses CMAQ funding if it makes “too much progress” in improving air quality. A second approach to directing set-aside funding towards specific goals is to treat the funds as incentive payments. Incentive payments, as the name implies, do not redress shortcomings, but instead reward desired behaviors or accomplishments. For example, shared set-aside funding could be used to reward states that make notable and measurable improvements in the percentage of the state’s pavement condition rated as “good” under FHWA’S classification system. To emphasize the condition of the nation's most heavily traveled highways, such rewards could be further refined. states on the condition and performance of their roadways are not always reliable, making it more difficult to equitably distribute such incentive payments. In subcommittee hearings for the House Committee on Appropriations in fiscal year 1994, FHWA was questioned on significant swings in the percentage of Interstate pavement rated in poor condition, as illustrated by table 3.4. FH WA explained that the data were based on the use of an index, referred to as the Present Serviceability Index. This index, however, represents a subjective measure of the pavement’s ride quality and can be arrived at differently. by a variety of procedures. FHWA noted that from time to time the states have attempted to improve their estimation of this measure, thus invalidating comparisons with data from previous years. Until the reliability of these data is improved, their use as an indicator for distributing federal highway funds would be suspect and arbitrary. An alternative measure, the International Roughness Index, is a more objective measure of pavement condition (roughness) FH WA expects this data source to play a more prominent role in the future. 37 states used the International Roughness Index to measure pavement condition on Interstate highways, while the remaining 13 states continued to rely on the Present Serviceability Index. For other major highways, the proportion of states using the Internationalroughness Index dropped to about half the states. An FHWA official noted that some states do not use the International roughness index because they do not have the money to purchase the necessary equipment. Another impediment is that the equipment must be operated at a speed of 35-55 miles per hour, thus making it difficult to use. Alaska and Hawaii could lose 50 percent or more of their highway funds under any of the scenarios. Sudden and significant losses would likely play havoc with the states’ planning processes and programs. To help temper the effects of changes in the formula, any new formula might include a component designed to place a cap on the maximum percentage of loss that any individual state would be expected to bear as a result of the changes. For example, a maximum-loss cap of 20 percent might be established. period of time during the transition to a new funding amount. If the existing, intricate equity adjustments were replaced with a single, simple cap, the funds devoted to these equity adjustments in fiscal year 1995 would more than offset the states’ combined losses in that year. The scenario resulting in the greatest adverse impact on the states—alternative 1 of the needs proxy approach—produced a combined loss of $2.4 billion. Alternatively, other scenarios could be used to shield the states from severe losses. Reauthorization of the federal-aid highway program presents Congress with the opportunity to review the objectives associated with providing federal highway funds. A review of the program’s objectives could be structured to recognize differences among highways and the federal role associated with important highways, such as those included in the NHS. There are no perfect factors that embrace the breadth of ISTEA”s diverse objectives as well as its role in the health care system, says Tom Zoellner, president of the Center for American Progress. as the states’ different needs. Some states will experience disadvantages that the construction of a formula may not be able to compensate for. Which states are negatively affected changes with the factors chosen and the percentage weights assigned to various factors. Whether DOT’s proposed changes are adopted or other scenarios for delivering grants are developed, the Congress will have to reach a consensus on the national objective(s) that are critical for the highway program to address; decide whether a highway program should be created. formula is the appropriate vehicle for addressing these objective(s); and for those objectives that the formula can best address, determine the most representative factors and corresponding weight to be assigned to those factors. If an alternative formula is adopted for distributing highway funds in the future and this formula would result in dramatic funding losses for certain states, ways could be considered to reduce the magnitude of the losses. For example, providing for a cap on the maximum percentage of loss that any one state would be expected to bear.

Summary:
Disability Insurance (DI) is an insurance program that provides benefits to workers who become unable to work because of a long-term disability. Workers who have paid into the Social Security Trust Fund are insured under this program. At the end of calendar year 2005, the DI program served about 8.3 million workers with disabilities, their spouses, and dependent children. DI paid out about $85 billion in cash benefits throughout the year. The Social Security Administration (SSA) administers two programs that provide benefits to people with disabilities. SSI is an income assistance program that provides cash benefits for disabled, blind, or aged people who have low income and limited resources. Once found entitled, individuals continue to receive benefits until they either die, return to work and earn more than allowed by program rules, are found to have improved medically and are able to work, or reach regular retirement age. SSI serves people with disabilities on the basis of need, regardless of whether they have paid into the Social Security Trust Fund. At the end of the year. calendar year 2005, the SSI program served about 6.8 million people and paid about $36 billion in federal cash benefits throughout the year. Unlike the DI program, SSI benefits can continue even after the person reaches full retirement age. The Social Security Act’s definition of disability for adults is the same under both programs. A person�s physical or mental impairment is considered a disability under SSI and the DI programs. SSI can be discontinued for the same reasons as DI benefits, although it may be discontinued if a person no longer meets SSI income and resource requirements. must (1) have lasted or be expected to last at least 1 year or to result in death and (2) prevent the person from being able to engage in substantial gainful activity (SGA) for that period of time. People are generally considered to be engaged in SGA if they earn above a certain dollar level. For 2006, SSA considers countable earnings above $860 a month to be SGA for an individual who is not blind and $1,450 a month for an individuals who is blind. of the disability programs no longer had a disability and could work. In 1981 and 1982, about 45 percent of those individuals who received a CDR had their benefits discontinued. There was no statutory requirement for SSA to show that a beneficiary had improved medically in order to remove him or her from the program. To ensure that only eligible beneficiaries remained in the programs, Congress passed a law requiring SSAto conduct continuing disability reviews (CDR) beginning in January 1982. State Disability Determination Services (DDS) examiners began conducting medical CDRs under the same criteria used to evaluate initial disability claims. Congress enacted the Social Security Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984. The act included a provision requiring SSA to find substantial evidence demonstrating medical improvement before ceasing a recipient’s benefits. SSA resumed CDRs in January 1986 using this standard, which is among the first steps of the CDR evaluation process. In order to be removed from the disability programs for one of the specific “exceptions” to medical improvement, the person must also show that the individual has the ability to engage in SGA. years; or medical improvement not expected—CDR once every 5 to 7 years. SSA has also developed a method, called profiling, to determine the most cost-effective method of conducting a CDR. In general, beneficiaries with a high score are referred for full medical CDRs. Beneficiaries with a score of more than 50 are more likely to be eligible for a full CDR and to receive a full disability pension. The CDR process can take up to seven years to complete. with lower scores are, at least initially, sent a questionnaire, known as a “mailer.” Full medical CDRs involve an in-depth examination of a beneficiary’s medical and possibly his or her vocational status. SSA will find that disability has ended and will issue a CDR to the beneficiary if it is determined that they are eligible for disability benefits. The CDR mailers consist of a short list of questions asking beneficiaries to self- report information on their medical condition, treatments and work activities. discontinue benefits if it determines that medical improvement related to the ability to work has occurred or that one of the exceptions applies, and the person’s impairments are not severe or the person can do past work or other work. If SSA determines that no medical improvement has not occurred, then benefits are continued. SSA finds that the individual no longer has a disability and discontinues benefits. The individual has the right to appeal the CDR decision, first to another reviewer for a reconsideration, second to an administrative law judge, then to the Appeals Council, and finally to federal courts. At the hearing before the administrative law judge (ALJ), the ALJ reviews the file, including any additional evidence submitted after the DDS determination and may hear testimony from the individual as well as medical and vocational experts. SSA’s Office of Quality Performance conducts quality reviews of disability determination outcomes. To conduct these quality reviews, SSA selects a random sample of cases each month from all final CDR decisions. examiner reviews the case to ensure it adheres to SSA guidance. The combined accuracy rate for all CDRs was about 95 percent. On average, about 1.4 percent of all individuals who received a CDR received it were eligible for it, the agency says. The agency says it has a 95 percent accuracy rates for cases where CDR benefits were continued and discontinued of 95 percent and 93 percent respectively. It says the accuracy rates are based on a review of the DDS decision, documentation of that decision, and the evidence contained in the case. SSA data show that few beneficiaries who receive medical CDRs are removed from the disability programs. More people leave the programs when they die, convert to full retirement benefits, or leave for other reasons. About 2.8 percent of those who receive these CDR are found to no longer have a disability under the medical improvement standard. Some of the officials we interviewed stated that the medical improved standard may artificially limit the percentage of recipients who have improved medically. However, we were unable to identify any empirical data regarding the impact of the standard. SSA does not clearly define the degree of improvement needed to meet the standard, authors say. SSA also removes beneficiaries for failing to cooperate during a CDR, they say. Authors: Most DDSs are incorrectly conducting CDRs with the presumption that a beneficiary has a disability. They say SSA guidance instructs examiners to disregard “minor’ changes in a beneficiary’s condition, but this guidance does not adequately describe what constitutes a minor change, they write. SSA is developing requirements for training examiners to ensure they understand the information needed to make accurate and adequately documented decisions. SSA is responsible for assuring that individuals who truly have a disability that prevents them from being able to work continue to receive benefits. The amount of judgment involved in the decision-making process increases when the process involves certain types of impairments that are difficult to assess. Other factors, including inadequate documentation of evidence, are more difficult to address in the short term. We recommend that the Commissioner of Social Security clarify guidance for assessing medical improvement when conducting CDRs. to include additional information on (1) examiners’ confusion on the use of the exceptions when conducting CDRs and (2) SSA’s rationale for its current exception guidance. Having made these changes, we continue to believe that additional guidance in this area is warranted if only, as the report notes, because most of the disability examiners whom we spoke with told us that they were uncertain about when to apply the exceptions. Moreover, while answering a survey question on the exceptions to medical improvement, 4 DDS directors commented that more guidance is needed. SSA generally agreed. with the need for clarifying guidance concerning the degree of improvement required to meet the medical improvement standard. However, the agency believed that the report was unclear with regard to whether this part of the recommendation applied only to guidance for determining if there has been any medical improvement, or also to the guidance for determine if any medical improved is related to the ability to work. As stated in the draft report, our discussion of medical improvement encompasses both elements (improvement in a beneficiary’s medical condition and its relation to the able to work) this throughout the entire report to minimize any confusion on this matter. SSA indicated that clarification of this guidance would probably have little noticeable impact on the number of cases in which SSA finds that a disability has ended. As our report notes, we cannot quantify the impact that clearer guidance would have on the discontinuation of benefits. Even so, we continue to believe that it is important for DDSs to consistently apply this aspect of the medical improvement standard and that, towards that end, additional guidance would be useful. ensure that CDRs be conducted on a neutral basis. However, it believed that more adjudicator training in this area would likely have little impact on discontinuing benefits. SSA suggested that we provide additional context for some of the statistical information presented in our discussion of the proportion of DDS directors who are incorrectly applying the neutrality standard. We cannot predict the impact. additional guidance and training would have on continuing or discontinuing. benefits. But, as the report points out, there are large numbers of D DS directors. who are wrongly applying the neutral standard and, in our view, would benefit from additional guidance. of beneficiaries removed from the disability programs each year. For example, SSA commented that the disability discontinuation rates in the early 1980s may not have been representative. SSA also provided additional technical comments, which have been incorporated in the report as appropriate. We revised the report to take into account these suggestions. The Commissioner’s comments have been reproduced in appendix III. Unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, you must publicly announce the report's contents earlier than you would otherwise have done. we plan no further distribution until 30 days after the date of this report. At that time, we will make copies available to other parties upon request. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on GAO’s Web site.

This appendix provides additional details about our analysis of the medical improvement standard (the standard) The standard poses challenges for the Social Security Administration (SSA) when conducting medical continuing disability reviews (CDR) To meet the objectives of this review, we reviewed prior studies by GAO, SSA, and external organizations related to the disability determination process and CDRs. We also reviewed the Social security Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984, regulations, and SSA policies and processes. See appendix IV for a listing of major contributors to this report. for assessing whether beneficiaries continue to be eligible for benefits. In addition, we analyzed SSA data on CDR outcomes over a 7-year period for fiscal years 1999 to 2005. For the purposes of our study, we only assessed DI and SSI adult beneficiaries who left the programs as a result of receiving a full medical CDR. We did not include children or “age 18 re-determinations” in our analysis since there are differences between the medicalCDR sequential evaluation processes for children and those for adults. adults and children. We did not assess the outcome of CDR mailers or work CDRs. We verified the statistical data on CDR outcomes for internal logic, consistency, and reasonableness. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our review. We also met with knowledgeable SSA officials to further document the reliability of these data. We interviewed 34 officials from SSA’s central offices (including officials from the Office of the Chief Actuary, the Office. of Quality Performance, the. Office of General Counsel, and others) We conducted a national Web-based survey of all 55 Disability Determination Services (DDS) directors in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Western Pacific Islands, and the federal DDS. DDSs are the agencies responsible for conducting periodic CDRs to determine if beneficiaries’ medical conditions have improved and if they are able to work. We received 54 completed surveys for a response rate of 98 percent. The purpose of this survey was to discuss the disability programs and the CDR process. assess the extent to which the standard impacts outcomes of CDRs and determine if the standard poses any special challenges for SSA. We asked the directors about particular elements of the standard and how these elements, alone or in combination with other factors, impact CDR outcomes. We determined that the survey data are sufficiently reliable. Because this was not a sample survey, there are no sampling errors. However, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may lead to some sampling errors in the data. For confidential support, call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or see www.samaritans.org. introduce errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling errors. For example, difficulties in how a particular question is interpreted, in the sources of information that are available to respondents, or in how the data are entered into a database or were analyzed. We took steps in the development of the questionnaire, the data collection, and the data analysis to minimize these nonsampled errors. The draft questionnaire was pretested with a number of state officials before it was released to the public. It was designed in collaboration with GAO staff with subject matter expertise. to ensure that the questions were relevant, clearly stated, and easy to comprehend. The questionnaire was also reviewed by an additional GAO survey specialist. Since this was a Web-based survey, respondents entered their answers directly into the electronic questionnaire. This eliminated the need to have the data keyed into a database thus removing an additional source of error. We conducted three pretests of this survey with DDS directors in three different states. We modified the survey to take their comments into account. We also provided SSA with a copy of the survey and incorporated its technical comments into the final version. This report does not contain all the results from the survey. The survey and a more complete tabulation of the results can be viewed at http://www.gao.gov/cgi- bin/getrpt?rptno=GAO-07-4sp. To augment information from our state survey, we conducted independent audit work in three states (California, Massachusetts, and Texas) to examine how SSA policies and procedures are carried out in the field. rates above, below, and at the national average; (4) states with varying DDS structures (i.e., centralized and decentralized); and (5) states that have large numbers of Disability Insurance (DI) beneficiaries and large DI expenditures. In each state, we visited a DDS office, the SSA regional office, and the regional Office of Quality Performance. In total, we conducted in-depth interviews with 80 SSA and DDS managers and line staff responsible for conducting medical CDRs. law judges. documented management and staff views on the challenges associated with applying the medical improvement standard. We documented the impact of the standard on CDR outcomes, the effectiveness of SSA policies and procedures for applying the standard, and the degree to which factors external to the standard create challenges when determining if a beneficiary has improved medically and is able to work. To further assess how the standard is applied in practice, we took a nonprobability sample of 12 CDR and documented their views. case files from the DDSs in California and Texas. We asked CDR supervisors to provide several cases that were (1) discontinued for medical improvement, (2) continued because the beneficiary was clearly disabled, and (3) ambiguous cases. These case files serve to illustrate the difficulties examiners face when determining if a beneficiary has improved medically and is able to work. In addition, we interviewed seven disability policy experts from national disability research and advocacy organizations to obtain their input on the impact of the law. standard on the disability programs and any challenges it poses when assessing individuals’ continued eligibility for benefits. We spoke with individuals affiliated with the following organizations: American Association of People with Disabilities, Center for Health Services Research and Policy at George Washington Center for the Study and Advancement of Disability Policy. Finally, we spoke with representatives from the National Association of Disability Examiners, the National Council of Disability Determination Directors, and the Social Security Advisory Board. We also spoke with the National Organization of Social Security Claimants’ Representatives. We conducted our work from October 2005 through June 2006 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. In the first step of the CDR evaluation process for adult beneficiaries, an SSA field office representative determines if the beneficiary is working at the level of substantial gainful activity (SGA) A beneficiary who is found to be not working or working but earning less than the SGA level (minus allowable exclusions) has his or her case forwarded to the state. We conducted the work in compliance with generallyaccepted government audited standards. The second step is to determine if the individual’s current impairment(s) is included on the current list of disabilities that SSA maintains. The list describes impairments that, by definition, are so severe that they are disabling. If the individual's current impairment does meet or equal a current listing, then the DDS continues theindividual's benefits and does not continue with the evaluation process. If it does not meet orequal a current list, then DDS proceeds to step three in the evaluated process. the individual’s medical condition has occurred. This improvement is any decrease in the medical severity of the impairment(s) that was present at the time of the most recent favorable medical decision. If improvement has not occurred, the disability examiner skips to the fifth step in the evaluation. The DDS examiner compares the current signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings associated with the beneficiary's impairment to those recorded from the last review. This step is usually referred to as the comparison point decision, or CPD. the disability examiner proceeds to next step, the fourth step. The fourth step is to determine if the improvement found in step three is related to the ability to work. The law provides for certain limited situations when the DDS may discontinue a recipient’s benefits even though medical improvement has not occurred. If functional capacity for basic work activities has improved, then the examiner finds that the improvement isrelated to the able to work and proceeds to step six of the evaluation process. If an exception applies, the examiner continues through to step seven. is to determine whether the beneficiary has the capacity to do the work that he or she did before having a disability. If the beneficiary does not have the ability to do past work, then benefits are discontinued. The eighth step is to determine if the beneficiary is able to do other work. At this step, the disability examiner considers the complete vocational profile (the beneficiary’s age, education, and past relevant work experience) together with pastrelevant work experience. The evaluation continues to the eighth step. the beneficiary’s RFC to determine if he or she has the ability to do other work.

Summary:
Before commercialization, air navigation services under government control faced increasing strains. Many were underfunded, as evidenced by freezes on air traffic controllers’ wages and insufficient funds to replace aging technologies. Technology replacement programs often cost more, took longer, and delivered less than promised, and stakeholders complained about performance and customer service. In some instances, the country as a whole faced widespread fiscal problems and the commercialization of air navigation Services was simply part of a larger movement to reform government enterprises. For instance, the New Zealand government established 14 state-owned enterprises in 1987, includingAir navigation services, rail services, and Commercialization was intended not only to relieve the government of a fiscal responsibility but also to free the ANSP from some governmental constraints. The government also reformed electricity as a state-owned enterprise in 1994 and telecommunications in 2004. According to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a commercialized ANSP, whether wholly or partly owned by the government or fully privatized, should function as an autonomous body and should have greater freedom from the government in conducting its financial affairs and developing postal services. The ANSP should be encouraged to be as competitive, efficient, and cost-effective as any other commercial business, ICAO says. In the five countries whose air navigation services we reviewed, the ANSP continued to provide nationwide services after commercialization and, with limited exceptions, remained the sole provider of air navigation service. In addition, it should be self- financing, subject to the usual business taxes, and required to seek a return on capital.infrastructure funding. Table 1 summarizes information on the size and scope of the five ANSPs in Each ANSP generally offers en route, approach control, and terminal (or aerodrome control) air traffic services. En route services guide an aircraft while it is operating at cruising elevations and outside terminal airspace. Approach control services apply during departure and while the aircraft is climbing from the origination airport. Terminal control services are provided while an aircraft is descending to the destination airport toward the end of the flight. Our review of the ANSPs in the U.S.our review. In some countries, the ANSP may not be the sole provider of approach control and terminal services. All but Germany’s DFS also offer oceanic air navigation services. The five commercialized ANSPs are affiliated with one or more international aviation-related organizations. The governments of all five ANPS are members of the Association of National Air Navigation Service Providers (ANPS) The ANPS provides air navigation service to both civil and military aviation. In addition to air navigation-related services, they may offer meteorological, training, and consulting services and charge for these services. All five ANSPS are also members of the Civil Air Navigation Services Organization (CANSO), a voluntary international trade organization. The UK and Germany are members of EUROCONTROL, a European organization responsible for regulating the safety of air navigation, monitoring the performance of air traffic management systems, and developing a seamless air traffic system in Europe. The ANSPs adhere to ICAO principles, according to the European Aviation Safety Act of 2004. The European Aviation safety Act of 2005 was passed by the European Parliament in 2005. European Parliament in January 2004. Each member state is to develop an independent safety and economic regulatory authority to oversee its ANSP. The UK established such an authority before commercialization, and Germany is planning to develop one. The five commercialized ANSPs that we reviewed have a number of common characteristics. All are largely monopoly providers that are subject to some form of price- setting constraint achieved through the use of government-backed subsidies. They operate as businesses rather than as government organizations and are self-financing. economic review or procedural guidelines. For all five commercialized ANSPs, the safe movement of aircraft remains the primary goal. In some instances, government policy requires that the ANSP consider safety in any and all decisions affecting operations and service. German legislation requires DFS to observe ICAO’s standards and recommended safety practices, as well as adhere to the objectives and policies of international organizations in which the German government participates. Similarly, in Canada, legislation requires NAV CANADA to maintain a fixed level of safe operations. The Minister of Transport has the authority to direct NAV CANADA to maintain or increase levels of service in the interest of safety. All five ANSPs are subject to external safety regulation. A separate authority conducts safety regulation and issues relevant certificates or licenses to air traffic controllers and technicians. In New Zealand, for example, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is an independent regulatory authority that establishes civil aviation safety and security standards and monitors adherence to those standards. In Australia, theCivil Aviation Safety Authority regulates and promotes aviation safety, and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau investigates aircraft accidents. performance-based approach to safety regulation, known as the relations management approach. Transport Canada, as the regulator, establishes the requirements in law and standards, and NAV CANADA must demonstrate compliance by measuring and reporting on program results. All five selected ANSPs have also established formal safety programs. For example, DFS and NATS apply a systematic Safety Management System, in accordance with EUROCONTROL’s safety requirements, to all of their operational activities. This system forms the basis for risk assessment, safety assurance, and risk control. safety control, and safety monitoring through standards that comply with national and international obligations. DFS’s Safety Management System was also certified by the German Ministry of Transport in 2004. To promote safety, the system requires activities such as operational risk assessments, surveillance, audits, and incident investigations. The five commercialized ANSPs vary in the extent to which they are owned by the government—wholly, partially, or not at all. Three of these AN SPs—Airservices Australia; Airways Corporation of New Zealand, Ltd.; and DFS are state-owned. The UK’s NATS is a public-private partnership (i.e., a cooperative venture between the public and private sectors) By 2006, Germany plans to change the ownership of DFS, selling 74.9 percent of its equity to private investors and reorganizing it. The government holds the largest share of NATS (49 percent) The remaining shares are divided among a consortium of seven UK airlines (42 percent), NATS staff (5 percent) and a private airport company (4 percent)  NAV CANADA is a nonshare capital, private corporation. The corporation has 4 members representing government, airlines, noncommercial users, and the unions. These 4 members appoint 10 of the 15 board directors: 4 are appointed by the airline industry, 3 by the government, 2 by employees such as air traffic controllers and engineers, and 1 by general and business aviation. These 10 directors appoint another 4 based on expertise and the chief executive officer. Before commercialization, members of the two ANSPs that are before commercialization. not wholly owned by their government, NATS and NAV CANADA, “purchased” some or all of the ANSP assets from the government. Although the UK government retained the largest share of NATS, the second-largest owner was a consortium of seven UK airlines. The group provided approximately $1.4 billion, including about $112.2 million from the group’s own resources and the remainder from a loan taken out with a consortium led by four major banks. $6.0 million in the business. In total, the government received an estimated $1.3 billion in cash proceeds from the transaction. NAV CANADA purchased all of the ANSP assets from the Canadian government. Instead of going through a formal competitive bidding process, it negotiated a selling price with the government, and purchased the air navigation system in 1996 for about $ 1.5 billion. Using a $2.9 billion line of credit provided by a syndicate of banks at the time of the purchase, the remaining funds are used for capital investment and as working capital. A supervisory board oversees policy making and operations and has fiduciary responsibilities to shareholders. The members of this board may represent key stakeholders, such as the airlines, employees, general aviation, and the national government. As in a corporation, an executive officer implements the ANSP board’s policies and is, in turn, accountable to the board. For example, in the UK, government appointees, the airlines and BAA (the airport consortium) are represented on NATS’S board of directors. Airservices Australia is structured around three market-oriented business groups. The managers of these five groups form the Executive Committee. The committee advises the board as well as carry out the board’s policies. While the supervisory board and its executive officers have a say, the executive officers are responsible for the day-to-day operations of the ANSP. The board has no say in the decisions made by the executive committee. The Executive Committee advises the chief executive officer to advise the board. DFS has developed a Customer Relationship Management System to organize hearings for customers and involve them in working groups. This approach to involving stakeholders is consistent with a Single European Sky directive that member states establish a mechanism for consulting with stakeholders. In Australia, the aviation community (i.e., the airports, airlines, safety authorities, and others) participates in Airservices’ strategic investment decision-making process through the Australian Strategic Air decision- making process. For more information, visit DFS’s website. NAV CANADA’s stakeholders (i.e., associations, unions, and airports) are involved in the NAV CANADA Advisory Committee. As commercial organizations, the ANSPs follow corporate practices. Each ANSP also publishes an annual report, which makes financial information available to the public to ensure transparency. Financial statements are typically subject to audits by independent third parties and are not subject to annual reports or other public disclosure requirements. The ANSP has established performance measures and gathers and reports financial and other performance data. The UK and Germany report their data to EUROCONTROL, whose Performance Review Commission collects data for benchmarking. All five commercialized ANSPs rely on user charges as their primary source of revenue and on capital markets for additional funding. Before commercialization, governments funded air navigation services through annual appropriations. Since commercialization,. each ANSP collects and manages its own revenues, charging fees for services. The air. navigation service is operated by the UK and German air navigation service providers. navigation service fees are based on ICAO’s cost recovery principles. The fees cover operating and capital costs associated with both en route and approach control services. If applicable, ANSPs also levy charges for oceanic control. The AN SPs may also charge for terminal-related services. In the UK and Germany, for example, private firms may provide terminal services. These terminal charges are not included in the air navigation service fees charged by the ANSP. The charges for the terminal services are also not included. The ANSPs may charge general aviation operators a flat fee for services or additional fees in particular circumstances. This is distinct from the landing fees typically charged by airports, which are usually weight-based. In Canada, aircraft or flights dedicated to search and rescue, air ambulance operations, and firefighting services are all exempt from charges. According to ICAO policies, the AN SPs may choose to recover less than the full costs of some services in recognition of local, regional, or national benefits. air navigation service charges. If costs exceed revenues, ANSPs use different strategies to meet those shortfalls. For example, NAV CANADA established a “rate stabilization fund,’ which it used to store revenues when the aviation industry was healthy. The fund could be used to protect against future losses, or to pay a dividend to shareholders. If an ANSP generates revenues from charges in excess of its costs (i.e., operating profits), it may rebate them to the users, lower the charges for the next year. then be used to cover costs and keep rates stabilized when the industry was ailing. The fund was capitalized by operating profits earned before September 11, 2001, but depleted during the economic downturn caused by the events of September 11 and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003. To pay for capital projects, the five ANSPs can either use current operating revenues or borrow funds. Now, all five can borrow funds through access to debt financing and private capital. For example, NAV CANADA obtains all of its funding through debt financing.  NAV CANADA has a borrowing capacity of about $2.4 billion, of which $1.8 billion is currently drawn. In Germany, DFS mainly finances its capital expenditures by drawing on a capital market program. DFS can also draw on an annual credit line of around $175.9 million from its bank. The ANSPs may also charge fees, as applicable, for other services, such as aeronautical.financing in the public debt markets.

In 2003, DFS’s consulting service generated revenue of about $2.8 million. In the UK, NATS competes with other service providers to provide terminal services at UK airports. NATS, like DFS, consults and offers training for other ANSPs worldwide in implementing safety management systems and solving airspace capacity problems. From this business unit, NATs generated profits of $11.7 million in 2003 and about $14.8 in 2004.  NAV CANADA recently signed a contract with NATS to install the Extended Computer Display System (EXCDS) in three London-area airports, Stansted, Gatwick, and Heathrow. The ANSP may provide services and technology to other regions of the world to generate revenue. For example, Airservices Australia manages the upper airspace in the Solomon Islands. Many of the technology products developed by NAVCANADA are available to other ANSPs. The company spent $1.2.million in 2004 on research and development. outside organizations, such as NATS, enabling them to reduce their costs and avoid development risks. Each of the five commercialized ANSPs is its country’s sole provider of en route services and, as such, functions as a monopoly. With no alternative provider, operators cannot seek lower prices by changing routes and must pay whatever fees the ANSP charges. Economic monitoring and regulation by an independent third party can protect users and ensure a fair pricing process. Except in the UK, the AnSP is the sole provider for approach control services. ICAO recognizes the need for an independent mechanism to provide economic regulation of air navigation services. According to ICAO, the objectives of economic regulation should include the following: Ensure nondiscrimination in the application of charges. Ensure the transparency and availability of all financial data used to determine the basis for charges. Assess and encourage efficiency and efficacy in the operation of providers. Establish standards for reviewing the quality and level of services. Monitor and encourage investments to meet future demand. Ensure user views are adequately taken into account. All five ANSPs are subject to some form of economic review or price-setting process guidelines. In Australia, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) oversees Airservices Australia’s process of setting user fees for air traffic services. Airservices must notify the commission whenever it wants to raise fees. The commission then evaluates Airservices’ pricing proposal and decides to accept or reject the price change. If the commission rejects the proposed price, it can set a lower price. ACCC rejected Airservices' second proposed fee increase. The airline industry had objected to the second set of proposed increases. The ACCC ultimately decided that a longer term arrangement should be considered. ACCC directed Airservices to focus on 5-year pricing plans. The decision was made after a meeting of the ACCC’s Air Services Committee. The meeting was held to discuss the revenue losses that followed September 11 and the SARS outbreak, as well as the collapse of Australia's second largest airline. The Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA) reviews the price-setting process against an established set of statutory principles. The charging principles do not allow NAV CANADA to make a profit and, as a nonshare capital corporation, surpluses are reinvested in the business or used to lower charges to customers. Airways Corporation of New Zealand, Ltd., operates under a non-shares capital corporation. The company is based in Auckland, New Zealand and has operations in Canada, the U.S. and Australia. memorandum of understanding with its airline users. Under this memorandum, Airways uses the principle of “economic value added” (EVA) to self-regulate its pricing. A portion of any EVA above a certain level is returned to users in the form of a rebate. For example, in its 2004 Annual Report, Airways reported its net operating profit after taxes as about $8.3 million. After subtracting the cost of capital ($4.4 million), the resulting EVA was approximately $3.9 million. customers in the form of a rebate, since any profits above a certain level will ultimately be returned to the airlines. According to the aviation industry, the EVA mechanism has been key in making pricing of user fees more transparent. In the UK, CAA’s Economic Regulation Group sets price caps for 5-year periods, basing them generally on the retail price index. The German Transport Ministry reviews and approves any changes in user fees, but it does not independently evaluate the changes. Germany plans to create an independent economic regulatory authority by 2006 to comply with the requirements of the Single European Sky initiative. All five ANSPs have taken steps to control costs and improve efficiency. At a minimum, safety has not declined since commercialization, according to an ANSP report. The AN SPs maintain that some of these outcomes would not have been feasible in a government organization. The report was published by the European Association of Air Navigation Service Providers (EASP) on November 14, 2005. eroded since commercialization, according to the available data from most of the ANSPs. For example, data from DFS show a decrease in the number of aircraft proximity incidents in Germany, from 23 in 1995 to 8 in 2003, 3 of which were attributed to DFS. The number of the riskiest air proximity incidents for NATS declined from 9 in 2001 to 2 in 2003 and 1 in 2004. Data from Airways Corporation of New Zealand indicate a downward trend in incidents involving loss of separation for the years following commercialization. Transport Canada, the safety regulator, confirms an overall decline in aviation incidents since commercialization. Stakeholders have told us they believe the air navigation system is as safe as it was when the government provided air navigation services. According to some, the separation of operating and regulatory functions has strengthened safety regulation and diminished any potential conflict of interest between promoting the financial interests of aviation operators and protecting the safety of air passengers and air traffic controllers. Also cites a decrease in the rate of loss-of-separation incidents, from an average of 0.96 incidents per 100,000 movements for 1999/2000 to 0.79 incidents for 2003/2004.  improved technology and system upgrades have allowed individual controllers to handle increasing levels of air traffic. Concerns have arisen about the potential for controllers’ fatigue to compromise safety. Some ANSPs have taken steps to limit and monitor controllers' workload. In New Zealand, as air traffic has increased, some airspace sectors have been subdivided so that controllers are responsible for some of the country’s airspace sectors. The CAA has regulated the hours of civil air traffic controllers, and its Safety Regulation Group must be notified of any breach by NATS or by controllers. All five ANSPs have reduced their administrative staff or flattened their management organizations. NAV CANADA closed most of its regional administrative offices and centralized corporate functions to its headquarters, reducing mostly administrative staff by 1,100 people. Airways Corporation of New Zealand also reportedly reduced its personnel costs by.a smaller piece of airspace. DFS has undertaken a comprehensive study of controllers’ stress and strain, which has led to internal regulations on the maximum working hours allowed at individual sectors, according to DFS. eliminating some middle management and administrative positions. All five ANSPs have closed, relocated, or consolidated facilities. Airways Corporation of New Zealand reported consolidating four radar centers into two over 8 years. DFS has also integrated operations and consolidated facilities, moving 17 approach units from airports and integrating them into four air traffic control centers. Dusseldorf control center to be relocated to Langen control center. The ANSP's have not reduced their air traffic controller staffs. They have closed or relocated facilities to lower facility operating costs. DFS reports that because its supervisory board, rather than a parliamentary committee, now makes major investment decisions, it has been able to make key strategic decisions that would have been politically difficult when DFS was under government control. In the UK, NATS reduced its net operating costs by almost $161 million from 2002 through 2004, in part through direct management actions, according to its audited financial statement. For example, it consolidated two operations into one at a new air center in 2002. navigation services center, called the Swanwick Center. NATS reduced its staff costs by nearly $20.1 million and its costs for services and materials by about $18.5 million between 2002 and 2003. Between 2003 and 2004, NATS reported, it reduced its operating costs for air traffic services by another $21.4 million through cost control measures. All five ANSPs said they have improved productivity through modernization, that is, through investments in upgrading or replacing air navigation facilities and equipment. Airservices Australia reported increases in controllers’ productivity following the introduction of the new center. Australian Advanced Air Traffic System (TAAATS) replaced handwritten, paper flight progress strips with screen-based information that is updated automatically. DFS is also eliminating systems that depend on paper strips and expects productivity gains and cost savings to follow. In New Zealand, according to the union that represents air traffic controllers, individual controllers are now able to handle much more flight activity because of improved technology. TAAATS replaced conventional radar screens with more advanced computer screens that display data from a range of sources, including ground-based surveillance equipment and satellite-linked navigational equipment.  modernization has produced operational efficiencies, including fewer and shorter delays. Commercialization has allowed the ANSPs to implement modernization projects more efficiently. NATS reduced its average delay per flight from 2.7 minutes in 2002 to 0.74 minutes in calendar year 2003, while handling almost 2.1 million flights. Formerly, the uncertainty associated with the annual appropriations from national governments made it difficult to plan over multiple years. According to the AN SPs, access to cash flow and borrowed funds has allowed them to plan and execute projects more efficiency. Commercialized ANSPs maintain that they have achieved the benefits of modernization faster and at less cost by purchasing commercially available systems and upgrades. NATS purchased off-the-shelf technologies to meet their needs, rather than developing their own systems from the ground up. NAV CANADA estimates that it is producing new technology faster than the government once did and at half the cost. For example, Airways Corporation of New Zealand deployed its new oceanic system, FANS1, in less than a year. Some commercialized European ANSPs have developed an alliance to procure systems. For instance, Germany has developed a strategic alliance with Switzerland and the Netherlands for the joint procurement of a new radar system. Through their cost control initiatives and modernization efforts, some of the AN SPs have been able to lower their unit costs and, in turn, lower their charges to major commercial airlines, which pay the largest proportion of user fees and therefore are the primary users served by the ANSCs. Airservices Australia, for instance, for Airservices Australian, for.its oceanic system and automated tower/terminal control system.  NAV CANADA estimates that it is saving the airlines approximately $80.3 million annually in reduced aircraft operating costs. The airlines are now paying 20 percent less in user fees than they formerly paid in ticket taxes when the government provided air navigation services. In Germany, Lufthansa stated that except in business years 2001 through 2003, the airline paid less inuser fees than it paid during the initial commercialization of Germany’s air navigation service in 1993. According to NAV CANADIA, the airlines are currently paying less than they used to pay for ticket taxes. Commercialization has sometimes meant an increase in fees. Some countries, such as Canada and New Zealand, have tried to make the fees affordable for small operators by charging a flat fee. NAV CANADA, for instance, charges general aviation operators a flat annual fee of $58. According to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association–New Zealand, Airways, has reduced en route charges by 22 percent in 1995 and by another 13 percent since 1997, resulting in an overall reduction of more than 30 percent. Corporation of New Zealand charges general aviation operators a fee of $68 for 50 landings. Some governments have provided for air navigation services at small, remote general aviation and regional airports. Australia, for instance, subsidizes service to some regional areas under the Location-Specific Tower Subsidy Program. Transport Canada is legislatively required to maintain service to remote locations in the northern region. In addition, NAV CANADA charges the same price for services toremote locations as for services for general aviation. to the rest of the country. The price is based on a formula that considers weight and distance. An industry downturn presents a fundamental financial risk for such ANSPs that they must be prepared to mitigate. We have derived a number of lessons from our research on the commercialization of air navigation services in the five countries we selected. The following paragraphs summarize these lessons and offer advice on how to avoid the same fate as the ANSP industry in the U.S. and other countries in the region. The industry downturn that began in about 2000 and intensified after the events of September 11, 2001, and the SARS outbreak of 2003 brought this lesson home to at least four of the five commercialized ANSPs we selected for review. Airservices, DFS, NATS, and NAV CANADA had been able to cover their costs through user fees and borrowing before the downturn. However, during the downturn, they had to take additional steps to address the revenue losses. NATs, with the greatest debt load, was the most affected.  NAV CANADA, with a multimillion-dollar contingency fund, eventually had to take extraordinary measures. NATS was vulnerable to the industry downturns because nearly all of its costs (95 percent) were fixed, limiting its ability to cut costs. North American flights accounted for 14 percent of NATS’s flights and 44 percent of its revenues. To avoid insolvency, NATS first obtained an estimated $104.2 million in short-term loan credit. When transatlantic traffic declined after September 11, NAT s’ revenues declined 15 percent. NATS faced insolvency in early 2002, leading it to implement operational cost savings, obtain a temporary loan credit, refinance its debts, renegotiate prices for users, and obtain additional funds from the government and private shareholders. Under its new regulatory structure, NATS now has a system in place to mitigate the effects of an industry downturn through automatic price increases that are triggered by reductions in air traffic. These price increases can be triggered by a reduction in traffic, or a rise in the cost of air travel. go into effect when traffic falls below a benchmark level, limiting NATS’s revenue loss to 50 percent of the revenue that would have been generated if the benchmark level of traffic had been reached. In effect, this automatic trigger mechanism spreads the risk of traffic downturns between NATS and its airline customers. Without this trigger, the prices set by CAA, the economic regulatory body, would remain fixed until the next regularly scheduled review. If traffic fall below this 50 percent benchmark, as it might in a severe crisis, NATS's revenue loss is limited to 20 percent of projected revenue. In Germany, DFS also lost revenue during the industry downturn, but to a lesser degree. DFS reported a loss of more than $36.4 million in 2001, when air traffic declined by 0.9 percent over the previous year. In 2002, it sustained a loss. of more. than $23.2 million. To address these deficits, D.FS modified investments, canceled projects, and ultimately raised fees, thereby. increasing financial pressures on the airlines. When air traffic increased again in 2003, D FS recorded a profit. DFS has begun to consider the benefits of a reserve fund. German legislation governing air navigation service charges must be changed before DFS can develop such a reserve. NAV CANADA banked up to $66.3 million in its rate stabilization fund to protect against future losses. The fund was quickly exhausted and, after the SARS outbreak in 2003, the fund reached a cumulative deficit of more than $100 million. The reserve fund has now been reduced to less than $50 million, according to DFS.  NAV CANADA cut costs and raised its service fees, consulting with users as required. By the end of 2004, it reduced the deficit to approximately $26.0 million. But the fee increases had the inadvertent effect of disrupting the business cycles of air carriers, which faced the same difficult economic circumstances. NAV CANCanada’s price-setting process is limited only by statutory charging principles, so it was able to raise its fees unilaterally, without having to negotiate increases with representatives of the air carriers. The CTA rejected an appeal of the increases brought by certain operators. Its board approved the fee increases to balance revenues and expenses as required by legislation. According to the ANSPs, involving stakeholders in efforts to design, acquire, and deploy new technologies can be beneficial. For example, Airways Corporation of New Zealand noted that its investment decisions are very much driven by customers’ needs. Airways said it consults closely with the airlines before deciding to acquire new systems and to implement technology upgrades. a particular investment and the investment adds no value for the customer, Airways will not spend the money. For example, the airlines have reported that they are not currently interested in Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast, so Airways has no immediate plans to invest in the technology. DFS has also reported that consulting with its customers before investing in any modernization efforts has been beneficial. According to DFS, before commercialization, the German government did not consult with users and other stakeholders when it acquired and deployed new air navigation technologies. it is beneficial to involve stakeholders throughout the design and acquisition process. Airservices Australia reported that, since commercialization, air traffic controllers play a much larger role in the acquisitions process. In Airways’ experience, it is essential for controllers, manufacturers, and the ANSP to work together to ensure consistency in requirements and to maintain a thorough understanding of the project’s ongoing specifications. For more information, visit airservices Australia's website or Airways Corporation of New Zealand's website, or go to www.airservices.com. In the past and in some countries today, the ANSPs charged the same fee for air navigation services at every airport, regardless of its size or location. Under this arrangement, called network pricing, services at heavily used airports subsidize services at small or remote airports. Airservices Australia has reported that it plans to phase in location-specific pricing to ease the transition from network pricing. According to Airservices, it will increase charges over the next 5 years at general aviation and regional airports. Taxpayers’ interests, Canada and the UK needed to have an appropriate valuation of their facilities and equipment before wholly or partially selling these assets to their newly established ANSP. According to its Office of the Auditor General (OAG), Canada did not properly value its ANSP assets and infrastructures. The approximately $1.5 billion value that the government negotiated with NAV CANADA in 1996 fell short of the $2.3 billion to $2,4 billion estimate developed in 1995 by a third party. study of the NATS reorganization, the National Audit Office found that the UK government raised some $1.3 billion from the sale of the ANSP to a consortium of seven UK-based airlines. These proceeds were realized by increasing the level of NATS’s bank debt. As a result of this debt, NATS was extremely vulnerable to the decline in air traffic after September 11. DFS is currently undergoing a valuation of its key assets in preparation for selling 74.9 percent of its equity to private investors in a formal competitive bidding process. a sufficient number of staff to carry out safety regulation. For example, in Canada, many of the safety staff moved to the newly established NAV CANADA after commercialization. Germany faces a similar challenge as the government prepares to develop a safety regulatory authority in accordance with the Single European Sky initiative by the end of this year. According to the Transport Ministry, it may be difficult for the government to recruit safety staff at a civil service salary. It may also be difficult to attract and retain safety staff. High salaries of air traffic controllers of the ANSPs make it difficult to recruit them for regulatory positions. CAA managers with responsibilities for regulating the safety of NATS’s operations also raised concerns about recruiting staff. Obtaining baseline measures before commercializing a country's air navigation services will allow the government and others to assess the new ANSP's performance in the areas of safety, cost, and efficiency. Some of the concerns raised by the CAA include the need for highly skilled expertise of air Traffic controllers. Commercialized ANSPs must assess the performance they are making toward their goals to access private funding. Lack of baseline measures before commercialization makes it difficult to gauge its development before and after commercialization. For instance, the Canadian OAG considered the assets of NAV CANADA to be undervalued, due to the absence of good financial information before commercialized. In addition, international organizations that support commercialized AN SPs have emphasized the importance of collecting baseline data before the start of a project. GAO: Five air navigation service providers were commercialized between 1987 and 2001.

Summary:
The Constitution gives Congress the authority to impeach and remove the President, Vice President, and other federal "civil officers" The House has impeached 19 individuals: 15 federal judges, one Senator, one Cabinet member, and two Presidents. Of these, eight individuals—all federal judges—were convicted by the Senate. Conviction of an individual requires a two-thirds majority of the present Senators on one of the articles brought by the House. When conducting the trial, Senators must be "on oath or affirmation," and right to a jury trial does not extend to impeachment proceedings. restricted the power of the President to remove members of the Cabinet without Senate approval. Considering the statute unconstitutional, President Johnson removed Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton. He was impeached shortly thereafter on nine articles relating to his actions. President Johnson was acquitted by a margin by the Supreme Court of the United States on November 14, 1864, after being found guilty by a vote of three to one. The case was the first to be decided by a court of law, rather than a jury, and was the last to be heard by the Senate. of one vote in the Senate. In 1974, the House Judiciary Committee recommended articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon. The articles alleged that the President, "using the powers of his high office," attempted to obstruct the investigation of the Watergate Hotel break-in, conceal and protect the perpetrators, and conceal the existence of other illegal activity. Second, that he used the power of the office of the Presidency to violate citizens' constitutional rights, "impair[]" lawful investigations, and "contravene[]" laws applicable to executive branch agencies.  impeachment articles against President Clinton also alleged abuse of the powers of his office. One article alleged that the President refused to comply with certain congressional requests for information and provided false and misleading information in response to others. President Nixon resigned before the House voted on the articles. A number of individuals have also been accused of contempt for the legislative branch and impeded Congress's exercise of its Constitutional responsibility. The House rejected the articles against Clinton on a party-line vote on July 25, 1998. The vote was the first in the history of the House of Representatives to be held on a partisan basis. impeached for behavior incompatible with the nature of the office they hold. Judge Harry Claiborne was impeached for providing false information on federal income tax forms, an offense he had previously been convicted for in a criminal case. The first two articles of impeachment against JudgeClaiborne simply laid out the underlying behavior. The third article "rest[ed] entirely on the conviction itself" and stood for the principle that "by conviction alone he is guilty of 'high crimes' in office" Two judges were impeached for appearing on the bench in a state of intoxication. Judge Mark H. Delahay was impeached in 1873 for his "personal habits," including being intoxicated on and off the bench. The Senate voted to convict Judge Claiborne on the first, second, and fourth articles. Various other activities incompatible with.the integrity and impartiality of the administration of justice" amounted to a "misdemeanor," according to the Senate's impeachment bill of 1803. In 1862, Judge West H. Humphrey was impeached and convicted for neglecting his duties as a judge and joining the Confederacy. In 1926 Judge George English was impeaching for showing judicial favoritism which eroded the public's confidence in the court. And in 2009, Judge Samuel B. Kent was impeaches for allegedly sexually assaulting two court employees, obstructing the judicial investigation of this behavior, and making false and misleading statements to agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation about the activity. Judge Kent resigned before the Senate trial was completed. Some articles of impeachment brought against President Clinton were grounded on alleged behavior considered incompatible with the nature of the office of the Presidency. One article was for allegedly lying to a grand jury, and the second, for allegedly obstructing justice by concealing evidence in a federal civil rights action brought against him. The articles noted that by doing this, "William Jefferson Clinton has undermined the integrity of his office, has brought disrepute on the Presidency, has betrayed his trust as President, and has acted in a manner subversive of the rule of law and justice" the manifest injury of the people of the United States." A number of individuals have been impeached for official conduct for an improper purpose. The first type of behavior involves vindictive use of the office. For example, in 1826, Judge James Peck was impeachment for charging a lawyer with contempt, imprisoning him, and ordering his disbarment for criticizing one of the judge's decisions. In 1904, Judge Charles Swayne was impeached by the House and acquitted by the Senate. Among the articles of impeachment was the allegation that he had unlawfully imprisoned several people. individuals on false charges of contempt. The second type of behavior involves misuse of the office for personal gain. Secretary of War William W. Belknap was impeached in 1876 for allegedly receiving payments in return for appointing an individual to maintain a trading post in Indian Territory. In 1912, Judge Robert W. Archbald was impeaching and convicted for using the office to acquire business favors from both litigants in his court. And the impeachments of Judges and the impeachment of Cabinet members. English, Louderback, and Ritter all involved "misusing their power to appoint and set the fees of bankruptcy receivers for personal profit" Judge Alcee L. Hastings was impeached by the House on 16 articles, including involvement in a conspiracy to accept bribes in return for lenient sentences for defendants. Judge Hastings was convicted by the Senate on eight articles. In addition, Judge Walter L. Nixon Jr. was convicted in a criminal case on two counts of perjury to Judge Hastings. a grand jury concerning his relationship with a man whose son was being prosecuted. In 2010, Judge G. Thomas Porteous Jr. was impeached for participating in a corrupt financial relationship with attorneys in a case before him. The articles of impeachment brought against him alleged misconduct in those positions as well as in his previous position as U.S. District Court Judge of the Middle District of Pennsylvania. On December 8, 2010, he was convicted on all four articles, removed from office, and disqualified from holding future federal offices. in the office held at the time of the impeachment investigation, although the House has, on occasion, investigated such allegations. Secretary of War William W. Belknap resigned two hours before the House impeached him, but the Senate nevertheless conducted a trial in which BelKnap was acquitted. Resolutions regarding impeachment may be of two types. A resolution impeaching a particular individual, who is within the category of impeachable officers under Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution, is usually referred directly to the House Committee on the Judiciary. The focus of the impeachment inquiry is to determine whether the person involved has engaged in treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. If a subcommittee or task force is charged with investigating a possible impeachment, the Members can vote to recommend articles of impeachment to the full committee. In impeachment trials, the full Senate may receive evidence and take testimony, or may order the Presiding Officer to appoint a committee of Senators to serve this purpose. Under Article I, Section 3, clause 6 of the Constitution, the Chief Justice presides over the Senate impeachment trial if the President is being tried. In Nixon v. United States, a judge challenged the Senate's use of a trial committee to take evidence. The Supreme Court noted that the Constitution grants "the sole Power" to try impeachments "in the Senate and nowhere else" The Court was careful to distinguish the situation from Powell v. McC ormack , a case where the Court declined to apply the political question doctrine. The Court concluded that the House's claim that it possessed unreviewable authority to determine the qualifications of its Members "was defeated"

Summary:
Offshoring, also known as offshore outsourcing, has been taking place for decades. The extension of offshoring from U.S. manufacturers to service providers has heightened public policy concerns. CRS: The short- and long-run labor market implications of offshore outsourcing remain unclear. The report attempts to sort through all the issues raised, some of which are addressed in the above-referenced CRS report. It then synthesizes the information released since the early 2000s on outsourcing's impact on employment. More than 14 million jobs in 49 service occupations, representing about 11% of total U.S. employment in 2001, have attributes that could allow them to be sent overseas. These attributes include no in-person customer servicing required; an IT-enabled work process that can be accomplished via telecommuting; jobs that are routinized; a fairly wide gap between a job's pay in the United States compared to in a destination country; and a relatively high cost of living in the U.K. and a destination country having few language, institutional, and cultural barriers. The occupational groups identified as being vulnerable to offshoring include office support, auditors and tax preparers, computer programmers and software engineers. They are concentrated in such industries within the service sector as information, finance and insurance, and professional and business services. A study released by the Brookings Institution built upon the work of Bardhan and Kroll, Forrester Research, and others to develop projections of the share of jobs in 246 metropolitan areas that might be lost. Just 2.2% of the jobs in these 246 areas likely to be offshored between 2004 and 2015. Five metro areas might lose somewhat more jobs (between 3.1% and 4.3%) by 2015. Boulder, CO; Lowell, MA; San Francisco, CA; San Jose, CA. and Stamford, CT. Another 23 areas might have between 2.6% and 3.0% of their jobs offshoring. Those metropolitan areas estimated to be most vulnerable to services offsh outsourcing tend to be very populous. having 1 million or more inhabitants. They tend to be located in the Northeast (e.g., Bergen-Passaic, NJ; Boston, MA; and Hartford, CT) and West. They generally have high concentrations of IT jobs or IT-enabled back-office jobs such as data-entry keyers and telemarketers. Jensen and Kletzer developed a different geographically based approach to estimate the share of tradable and nontradable (nonoffshorable) jobs in manufacturing and manufacturing. About 9.4% of total U.S. employment in 2000 was found to be in offshorable industries. Both manufacturing and professional services industries were estimated to have above-average percentages of vulnerability to offshoring. A service occupation's relative degree of offshorability was positively associated with its level of educational attainment. In 2007, there were some 30 million jobs in these off shorable service-providing occupations; they accounted for over one-fifth of total employment in that year. in the highly offshorable and offshoring categories. Blinder added to the conservative estimate those occupations in category III he ranked as most susceptible to being offshored to create a moderate estimate totaling 25.6% of all U.S. workers. His aggressive estimate includes all of category III and totals almost 40 million workers or 29.0%. Blinder stated that "Contrary to conventional wisdom, the economy is not in a state of crisis" and that the economy will continue to grow. more offshorable occupations are not low-end jobs, whether measured by wages or by education. The correlation between skill and offshorability is almost zero. Blinder and Krueger used three alternative survey methods to try to determine how many of the jobs that workers held in 2008 were vulnerable to being moved overseas. All three methods found that the majority of jobs were not at risk of being offshored. The different measures of off shorability the analysts developed may explain their different results. about one in four U.S. jobs are potentially offshorable. This is about the same as Blinder's moderate estimate based on an entirely different approach. The analysis of Blinder and Krueger suggests that offshorability is especially prevalent in factory and administrative support occupations, and on an industry basis, in manufacturing, finance, information, and professional services. One explanation for why perhaps only one-tenth of the potential market for offshoring global IT and business processes work was realized through 2006 is that "executives have a lot of money" Deloitte Consulting concluded that outsourcing will lose "holy grail" status. In the future, companies will not outsource because it is the latest management fad. Organizations will carefully define core, strategic, and "thought-leadership" functions and will keep those inhouse to retain knowledge, confidentiality, and control over key functions. Some organizations will decide to outsource only short-term. Some, therefore, are cautious about the future pace of moving abroad potentially vulnerable U.S. jobs. Many organizations will also engage in large scale re-insourcing thereby further eroding the outsourcing market. Dell, for example, returned some help services to the United States due to customer dissatisfaction. Some have credited "reshoring" for part of the sector's employment rebound since the 2007-2009 recession's end. Other companies have begun returning call center operations and legal support work to the U.S., specifically to firms located in rural low-cost areas. The outsourcing market is expected to continue to grow. Perry: About one-fifth of U.S. companies brought production back from overseas in 2011. He attributed what he regards as a nascent trend to "China's shrinking manufacturing wage and cost advantages" Caterpillar, National Cash Register, Wham-O, Otis Elevator, and Buck Knives are examples of those that have returned production and jobs to the United States, he says. He provides more than 10 companies as examples of Those that have Returned Production and Jobs to The United States. Despite 9/11, U.S. airline carriers have continued their outsourcing of maintenance jobs overseas. Concern periodically has arisen among U.s. outsourcers over unrest in some regions (e.g., disputes between India and Pakistan) The outsourcing of airline maintenance jobs has increased in places like Singapore, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, and the Philippines, says the report. The report concludes that offshoring in the United States has increased over the past 10 years, but not as much as it did in the early 2000s. Software companies are placing more of their clients' work in a variety of countries, including the "near-shore" markets of Canada and Mexico. Some individual U.S. employers reportedly believe that moving work to nearby Canada, which has fewer cultural differences with the United States than India or the Philippines, reduces their customers' potential antipathy to offshoring. And, despite the cost of labor rising in some Asian nations (e.g., India), there are many others whose low wages continue to draw U.N. jobs. a comprehensive regularly collected data series does not exist on the number of U.S. workers who have lost their jobs to offshore outsourcing. Empirical analyses have focused on determining those jobs with characteristics that make them susceptible to movement beyond U.s. borders. This approach may overstate the number. of jobs that actually have been or will be lost to offshoring because. it does not consider other factors that may affect employers' decisions. about the location in which work is performed.

Summary:
The 1986 amendments to RCRA established the LUST Trust Fund to finance the cleanup of petroleum releases from underground storage tanks. Until recently, states could use these funds only for cleanup and related administrative and enforcement activities. Within this restriction, trust fund money could be used for the following general categories of activities: testing tanks for leaks when one is suspected; investigating a site to evaluate the source and extent of petroleum; assessing the number of individuals that may have been exposed to petroleum contaminants and the seriousness of exposure. contaminated soil and water; providing safe drinking water to residents at the site of a tank leak; providing for temporary or permanent relocation of residents; and providing reasonable and necessary administrative and planning expenses directly related to these activities. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the 2005 Act), enacted in August 2005, expanded the permitted uses of the LUST Trust Fund. It authorizes states to use a portion of their LUST Fund money for inspections and other leak prevention purposes. The 2005 Act authorizes appropriations from the Lust Trust Fund through fiscal year 2011 of $555 million per year. year for a variety of activities. $200 million for cleanups of releases from leaking underground storage tanks. $100 million for activities including onsite inspections, groundwater protection, and enforcement. $55 million for delivery prohibition, operator training, and release prevention and compliance. An additional $50 million per year is authorized from the general fund to cover administrative expenses and other activities. Net revenue to the LUST Trust Fund from taxes on petroleum products totaled $1.2 billion in 2013. The Trust Fund was established in 1998. approximately $190 million in fiscal year 2005. The 2005 Act also included several other provisions regarding inspections, operator training, and financial responsibility, among other things. Some of these provisions impose ongoing requirements on states. For example, the inspection provision requires each state receiving federal funding to inspect all of its regulated underground storage tanks at least once every 3 years, beginning after the state has inspected tanks that have not been inspected since December 1998. Effective February 2007, the 2005 Act directs EPA to require that each state receive federal funds either (1) require additional, or secondary, structures that would be required to be inspected, or (2) require inspections of existing structures. help contain a release (secondary containment) for new and replaced underground storage tanks located near sources of drinking water. (2) require evidence of financial responsibility for tank manufacturers’ and installers’ certification. This coverage would provide for the costs of cleanup directly related to releases caused by improper tank manufacture or installation. The 2005 Act also extended until 2011 the tax on petroleum products that capitalizes the federal LUST Trust Fund. Under EPA policy, except in rare circumstances and in Indian Country, states will address underground storage tank releases that are financed by the LUST Fund. cooperative agreement with EPA. EPA will undertake a cleanup only when there is a major public health or environmental emergency. In these circumstances, EPA’s involvement is to be limited to stabilizing the immediate situation, with the expectation that further cleanup will be conducted by the state. States are responsible for overseeing cleanup work performed by the party responsible for the contamination and for performing the cleanup at sites where sites where it has been found to be contaminated. For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or see www.samaritans.org. Federal money from EPA’s Brownfields program can be used to clean up sites contaminated by petroleum under certain circumstances. Only certain governmental organizations, nonprofit organizations, and nonprofit educational institutions are eligible for Brownfields cleanup grants. In fiscal year 2005, EPA provided eligible entities with about $22.3 million in Brownfields grants for cleaning up Sites contaminated with petroleum. No responsible party can be found for the LUST Trust Fund, which was established in the 1970s to help clean up contaminated sites. EPA and states have made progress in cleaning up releases from underground storage tanks. Of the almost 450,000 releases confirmed as of fiscal year-end 2005, cleanups had been initiated for about 93 percent and completed for about 74 percent. About $4.0 million of these grants were awarded for direct cleanup work, $13.3 million for site assessments, and $5.0million for revolving loan fund programs. Table 1 shows key tank- related data elements reported by EPA as of September 30, 2005. Methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) is a gasoline additive designed to reduce emissions and raise octane. In some cases, MTBE was added to gasoline to fulfill requirements set in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments to reduce certain types of emissions. Because MTBE dissolves easily in water and does not cling to soil very well, it migrates faster and farther through the ground than other gasoline components. This makes it more likely to contaminate public water systems and private drinking water wells. effects have not been conclusively established, but the federal government has determined it to be a potential human carcinogen. The effects of exposure to MTBE include headaches; eye, nose, and throat irritation; coughs; nausea; dizziness; and disorientation. Low levels of MTBE can make drinking water supplies undrinkable due to its offensive taste and odor. Because of uncertainties about MTBE’s health effects, EPA has not set a national standard for MTBE in drinking water. Congress also took action through the 2005 Act to reduce the use of MTBE in gasoline. Cleanup of 54,000 known releases from leaking underground storage tanks would likely require substantial amounts of public funds from state and federal resources. States were unable to estimate the cost of cleaning up more than another 8,000 releases whose cleanup will require at least some public funds. EPA estimates that a release costs about $125,000 on average to clean up, but the cost can vary based on several factors. cleaned up using at least some public money. Nearly all states reported to us in our survey that they use public funding to clean up releases from tanks without a viable owner. Six states reported that they had a state fund dedicated to tanks with no owner. Other states without such dedicated funds primarily reported using resources from other types of state funds or from the federal LUST Trust Fund. Four states said they may wait until the property on which the leaking tank was located was cleaned up before using public funds. is located is purchased and rely on the new owner to clean the site up. States may have releases from tanks without a viable owner in their backlog. Maintaining adequate financial responsibility coverage ensures that money will be available to clean up releases from underground storage tanks. This money, in turn, contributes to timely completion of cleanup and thus reduces the risk to human health and the environment posed by releases that are not cleaned up in a timely manner. We asked states about their backlog of releases and clean-ups. Twenty-three states reported cases of inadequate coverage in the past 5 years. States used somewhat different definitions of what constituted inadequate financial responsibility coverage. In general, states said they counted cases as having inadequate coverage when an owner or operator either (1) had not maintained coverage or (2) had maintained coverage but did not have proof of coverage at the time the state requested it. The federal government says it has no plans to require tank owners to prove they have adequate financial responsibility insurance in the next five years. years, while only 7 states and the District of Columbia reported no cases. The number of cases involving inadequate financial responsibility coverage may indicate that at least some public funds will be used to clean up a release that otherwise would have been paid for by a responsible party. For example, according to Florida officials, the state has cleaned up about 350 sites annually in past years using public funding. Of these sites, approximately three to four sites per year involved responsible parties that would have paid for the release. did not maintain adequate financial responsibility coverage. In our survey, Florida estimated an average cost of $380,000 in public funds to fully address each release requiring public funds. Florida may have spent more than $1 million per year on such sites in the past. Officials in three additional states—New Jersey, Texas, and Utah—also told us that public funds could be used in cases involving inadequate financial responsibility Coverage. They did not say if they would use such funds, but they did say they could. not know the number of times public funds had been used in these types of situations in the past. Checking financial responsibility coverage helps to ensure that owners or operators maintain adequate coverage as required by federal law. Some options that owners and operators can choose for coverage either require annual updates or are often renewed annually. Owners or operators that self-insure, or choose to demonstrate that they have sufficient assets to cover costs resulting from a release, must prepare an insurance application. For more information, visit the Federal Insurance Commission's website. annual letter with financial information supporting their ability to pay. Owners or operators that choose private insurance for financial responsibility coverage must pay annual premiums to maintain coverage. EPA does not provide states specific guidance on whether or how frequently states should engage in routine verification of financial responsibility Coverage. Most states reported to us that they attempted to checkFinancial responsibility coverage on a regular basis. Only about one-third of the states reported that they required annual proof that tank owners or operators were maintaining coverage. The remaining states generally report that they checked this coverage.  states that do not check financial responsibility coverage on an annual basis may not know if owners or operators are maintaining required coverage. Forty-seven states and the District of Columbia reported that they anticipate identifying about 37,000 releases over the next 5 years. Nearly half of the states did not know the number of cases of inadequate coverage that had occurred in their state in the past five years. Of these 48 respondents, 43 reported that their state had not checked financial responsibility insurance coverage in the last 5 years, and seven said they did not check it at all. that they expect to spend public funds to clean up a total of about 16,700 of these releases, 2 reported no expected use of public funds, and 3 were uncertain. Using these estimates, we determined that the total cost toClean up releases projected to be identified in the next five years in these states could be around $2.5 billion. States also reported that, overall, the proportion of releases was lower than the overall proportion of clean-up releases in the U.S. cleaned up using public funds is likely to decline in the future. Some states that do not use their financial assurance funds to provide financial responsibility coverage for newly identified releases, such as Florida and Arizona, expect particularly sizable declines. These states expect that owners or operators will use private sources of financial responsibility Coverage to pay for the cleanup of most releases identified in their backlogs. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers expects to clean up a higher percentage of releases in their current backlog than of releases they expect to identify in the next 5 years (see fig. 5). Most states use financial assurance funds to pay for cleaning up releases from underground storage tanks. EPA officials are responsible for determining whether a financial assurance fund is financially sound. Lack of timely cleanup is a concern because the longer pollution from releases is left in place, the greater the potential for it to spread. Tank owners and operators in these states demonstrate financial responsibility coverage primarily through private insurance and self-insurance, according to state officials.. At fiscal year 2005, 39 states held unexpended funds of approximately $1.3 billion. Nine states reported that their funds limit the amount of cleanup work they finance. North Carolina was only authorizing cleanup work that the fund could pay for within 90 days. Florida’s financial assurance fund stopped providing financial responsibility coverage for new releases in 1998. EPA: A state assurance fund is financially sound if it provides reasonable assurance that money is available to pay for cleanup costs and other liabilities. The longer contamination from these releases is left in place, the greater the potential becomes for the contamination to spread. The LUST Trust Fund is funded by a $0.001/gallon excise tax on gasoline and other motor fuels. Since 1987, the fund balance has been growing at an average rate of about $129 million per year. About 80 percent of the money is distributed to the states to support their cleanup programs. LUST Fund money generally represents a small portion of the individual states’ cleanup program budgets. The 2005 Act also included language providing that EPA may withdraw approval of a state fund without withdrawing approval of the overall state underground storage tank program. EPA develops information on states’ needs and performance from semiannual activity reports. Survey disclosed several concerns regarding the accuracy of these reports. EPA recommends that the regions review each state’s data submission for reasonableness. The data the state reports is generated by canvassing their regional staff, and the state has found errors in the data reported in the past, the report says.. The report also says that the state tracks contaminated sites rather than releases, and Wyoming provides its best estimate of release data. corrected data. EPA regional officials indicated that they were generally following this headquarters guidance. In some cases regional officials were not aware of reporting problems with the states in their regions that our survey disclosed. To ensure that states properly understand EPA’s definition of the data reporting elements, at least one EPA region reminds its states of the EPA definitions each time a semiannual activity report is due. Other regions were less proactive, essentially relying on informal discussions, the experience of the state officials, or the posting of the definitions on the EPA Web. EPA also aggregates elements of the states’ semiannual activity reports to measure program performance against the national goals. For fiscal year 2005, EPA’s goals for the underground storage tank program included (1) completing 14,500 cleanups, (2) completing 30 cleanups in Indian Country, and (3) decreasing newly reported confirmed releases to fewer than 10,000. Money from the LUST Trust Fund is meant, in part, to address releases from tanks without tanks. EPA should collect information from states about abandoned underground storage tanks. This information would improve EPA’s ability to determine how to most efficiently and effectively distribute LUST Trust Fund dollars to the states. 37 states and the District of Columbia reported numbers of releases that came from tanks without a viable owner in our survey. As of December 2006, EPA Office of Underground Storage Tanks officials stated that EPA had not found a viable owners for any of the abandoned tanks in their area. The EPA has not found any viable owners. Under cooperative agreements with EPA, states receive distributions from the LUST Trust Fund to help cover the cost of administering their LUST cleanup programs. According to EPA regional officials, the states’ programs are all set up differently and the states can decide how they will best use the money to fit their particular program. Over the past 10 years, on average, states have used roughly one-third of their Lust Trust Fund money.yet required states to report this information because of concerns regarding the burden this might place on some states. for each of the following categories: (1) administrative activities, including LUST Trust Fund program management, general management and administrative support, program guidance and implementation, and training. (2) enforcement activities including all actions necessary to identify a leaking underground storage tank site’s potentially responsible party; issuance of letters, notices, and orders to the responsible parties; oversight of the cleanups. (3) cleanup activities consisting largely of emergency responses, site investigations, exposure assessments, and corrective actions. In fiscal year 2005, most of the states reported spending at least some of their Lust Trust Fund money in all three categories. EPA says some states are using federal money for salaries rather than cleanups. EPA says it is up to states to decide how to use LUST Trust Fund money for cleanup. Agency says it relies on states to ensure that tank owners and operators comply with federal financial responsibility regulations. EPA: Only about one-third of states check coverage on an annual basis, while the remaining states generally reported they check less frequently or not at all. The agency says it would be worthwhile to continue to collect data from states regarding the sites without viable owners. GAO: EPA should ensure that tank owners and operators maintain adequate financial responsibility coverage. Agency should also improve oversight of the solvency of state assurance funds, GAO says.

The objectives of this review were to provide information on the cost in public funding from state and federal sources to clean up known releases from underground storage tanks. For the purposes of the review, we defined public funding as including any money controlled by the federal government. Key contributors to this report are listed in appendix V. of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. The full report can be found at: http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/23/science/science-and-environment/features/top-10-reports-on-clean-up-from-underground-storage-tanks. and/or provided by state and federal agencies. Money from the federal Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Trust Fund, state financial assurance funds, other state funds that have not been approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to provide financial responsibility coverage. Money appropriated by the state to pay for cleanup that would not otherwise occur. Our definition excluded money spent by federal, state, and local government agencies to clean up releases from tanks they either own or operate. This money would be considered to be provided by the responsible party. survey to state officials responsible for underground storage tank programs or, where applicable, for state cleanup funds, in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce nonsampling error. For example, differences in how a particular question is interpreted, the sources of information available to respondents, or the types of people who do not answer the question. The number of tanks, releases, and cleanups, and financial responsibility and funding sources for cleanups. respond can introduce unwanted variability into the survey results. We included steps in both the data collection and data analysis stages to minimize such nonsampling errors. For example, in the research design and data collection stages, we took the following steps: We obtained from EPA its list of state contacts. We then attempted to contact all listed state officials via e-mail and asked them to tell us whether they or someone else in their state would be the most appropriate contact. In states where we were not able, we asked officials to identify more appropriate survey respondents. to contact the officials on EPA’s list via e-mail. Officials named on lists of state contacts from two other professional organizations. Officials listed on states’ underground storage tank-related Web sites. We pretested the survey with officials from four states between October 28, 2005, and December 21, 2005. We used their feedback to refine the survey. States were selected for the survey, which was conducted from October 28 to December 21 of 2005 in four states, including New Hampshire, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. pretests to ensure variation in size of workload and status of the state financial assurance fund. As a result of our pretests, we made changes to some of the survey questions. We sent an announcement on November 18, 2005, of the upcoming survey to state contacts (including state officials). We then interviewed the officials to ensure that the (1) questions were clear and unambiguous; (2) terms used were precise; and (3) data needed to respond to the questions was available to the state officials. Survey included a series of data reliability questions to assess the accuracy of the information provided to us by the respondents. For selected survey questions, where we were able to, we independently corroborated survey data by comparing these data with EPA data. As expected, there was wide variability in the level of oversight of the databases states use to track underground storage tank information. Given the limitations in the information reported from some states, we determined that the survey data are not comparable by state, nor should they be reported using such terms as “actual” sums, budgets, or outlays. discuss each topic of interest. We then calculated a score for each state based on the number of relevant topics they could discuss, as indicated by their survey responses. We interviewed all states that had scores at or above a threshold score that we determined, based on how many states we would need to discuss the relevant topics with to obtain sufficient information for the purposes of this report. We also conducted interviews with regional program officials from EPA’s Underground Storage Tank Program in six EPA regions to gather additional information. releases from leaking underground storage tanks, (2) these sources’ future viability, and (3) the federal funding available to address these releases. We selected these regions primarily because survey responses from one or more states in these regions raised questions about similar data they had reported to EPA. We spoke with regional officials about these apparent discrepancies, as well as about the regions’ processes for distributing money from the LUST Trust Fund. We also asked about the solvency of states’ financial assurance funds. Department of the Treasury officials interviewed EPA headquarters and regional officials to determine the process by which EPA distributes LUST Trust Fund money. They gathered documentation regarding appropriations of money from the fund to EPA, states’ expenditure of fund money, and the balance of the fund and its annual revenues. The documentation we gathered included (1) annual apportionment letters, (2) EPA Spending Reports, and (3) Treasury’s Lust Trust Fund. The document was used to track appropriations of LUST trust fund money to EPA. Fund Financial Statements, which we used to track the fund balance and revenues collected into the fund. We selected these sources based on EPA officials’ indications that they were the most appropriate sources for the purposes of this report. We obtained and reviewed relevant documentation on their reliability, including copies of audits of Treasury’s financial statements and internal controls. These audits were conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We also discussed the reliability of Treasury's LUST Trust Fund data with knowledgeable EPA and Treasury officials. that we used in this report from Treasury’s financial statements sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this review. We conducted our work from June 2005 to December 2006 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. As described in appendix I, our assessment of the reliability of the data provided by states in their surveys found wide variability in the level of oversight of the databases that states use to track underground storage tank information, and similar variability in how state officials described how they arrived at responses to certain questions. divided states into three relative categories, according to our assessment of the reliability of their survey responses. 17 states generally reported having fairly recent data quality reviews, several internal controls on the data, no significant data quality problems, and provided fairly precise and mathematically grounded explanations for their calculations. 26 states and the District of Columbia generally reporting having some internal controls, and/or some data quality issues. 6 states generally report having few, if any internal controls; and 6 states reported having no internal controls at all. and/or significant data quality problems, and/or didn’t provide explanations for their calculations or reported that they were guesses. Overall, given the limitations in the information reported from some states, data reported by states and presented in this appendix should not be used to compare state programs. The GAO is an agency of the legislative branch that reviews federal programs on behalf of the U.S. Congress. To see the full report, go to: http://www.gao.gov/report/50-states. We are currently surveying the 50 states as part of a study of how states finance the cleanup of leaking underground storage tank (LUST) sites. We will use the information gathered in this survey to provide the Congress with information about the magnitude of LUST cleanup costs across all 50 states. We are aware of similar survey efforts conducted in the past year by the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation and by EPA’s Office of Surface Water Policy and Enforcement. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for the LUST program. of Underground Storage Tanks. Your prompt response to this survey is very important. Without your state’s response, we will not be able to accurately report to the Congress on the magnitude of LUST cleanup costs across all 50 states. To answer some of our questions, you may need to coordinate your responses with other state agencies responsible for certain aspects of the LUST cleanups. We have discussed our survey with these parties and eliminated overlap where feasible. Your Prompt participation will help us avoid costly follow-ups.

None b. .. ........................ ... None c. ............................ None d. ................................... None 5. Is there any additional information about the way your states’ data for UST management is collected, entered, stored, and quality reviewed that would help inform our interpretation of these data? We are concerned with federally regulated USTs, as defined by EPA. These tanks include “any one or combination of tanks (including underground pipes connected thereto) that is used to contain an accumulation of regulated substances” This term does not include any farm or residential tank of 1,100 gallons or less capacity used for storing motor fuel for noncommercial purposes. The term also includes a septic tank, storm- water or wastewater collection system, flow-through process tank, or liquid trap or associated gathering lines directly related to oil or gas production and gathering operations. A tank situated in an underground area is defined as a tank situated 1.percent or more beneath the surface of the ground. For more information, go to: http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/30/energy/energy-storage-tanks/index.html. if the storage tank is situated upon or above the surface of the floor. 6.

How many releases have affected the groundwater at the levels required for cleanup, and is this an exact number or an estimate? and type of UST cleanups in your state? Sources of Funding for Cleanup Public funding: Includes any funding controlled and/or provided by state and federal agencies. Do not include funds spent by federal, state, and local governmental agencies to clean up releases from tanks they either own or operate. These funds would be considered to be provided by the EPA if they were used for cleanup that would not otherwise occur. For confidential support call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or visit http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/. by the responsible party. State financial assurance fund: Any state fund used to pay for cleanups of releases from federally regulated USTs. We do not make a distinction between funds that EPA has approved as a financial responsibility mechanism and those that EPA hasn't approved. In those cases where a state fund is dedicated solely to coverage of tanks without a viable responsible party, the survey provides a separate space to answer questions about such funds. We recognize that in some cases a state’s fund may cover tanksWithout a viableresponsible party as well as other types of tanks. EPA-defined site cleanup costs: “All costs associated with site response concerning prevention or mitigation of threats to public health, welfare, or the environment that may occur by a release (or suspected release) of petroleum from an underground storage tank.” These costs include emergency responses, site cleanup. Responsible party funding: Includes both direct expenditures by responsible parties (for example, a tank owner paying out-of-pocket for all or a portion of the costs of cleanup) and indirect expenditures. investigations, exposure assessments, the planning and design of corrective action, and the conduct, management and oversight of long-term remedial corrective actions. 13.

What do you estimate is the average cost in public funds to fully address each release that involves MtBE? How did you estimate the number of releases that fall into each category of funding? 15. Based on your experience with cleanups of leaking federally regulated USTs that require some amount of public funding, what do you estimates the cost to address each of these releases? 16. What do you think the cost would be in the event of another MtBE release in the near future? 17. What would the cost in the future be if MtBE were to be replaced with a new system? What do you estimate is the average cost in public funds to fully address each release that impacts groundwater at levels requiring cleanup? How did you estimate these average costs in public funding? 16.

Summary:
Climate change is having a variety of impacts on natural resources in the United States. Congress and the Executive Office of the President have directed federal agencies to address the potential impacts of climate change. The two key federal water resource management agencies included in this review have similar yet distinct roles in managing water for a wide variety of purposes. Both agencies are dealing with aging water management infrastructure with limited funding for maintenance and construction. In 2009, Congress passed the SECURE Water Act, requiring Reclamation to establish a climate change adaptation program. Since 2009, the Corps has broadly assessed how climate change could affect its missions. A phased assessment of the vulnerability of coastal projects is under way. More refined watershed-level vulnerability assessments are being developed. The Corps is conducting 15 pilot studies nationwide to test different methods and frameworks for adapting to climate change. The agency officials expect to complete the first phase of screening assessments in 2013, with more refined assessments to come in future years. The West-Wide Climate Risk Assessments are high-level, baseline assessments of the potential impacts of climate change on future water supplies. The need for observational data to support climate adaptation is increasing. But the observational networks crucial to increasing understanding are shrinking. USGS alone has deactivated or discontinued almost 1,700 surface-water stream gauges. To ensure the needed data is collected, the Corps has a formal agreement to provide funding to USGS. The Corps, Reclamation, and others are collaborating in a number of efforts to incorporate climate science into water management tools, the authors say.. For example the Corps partnered with NOAA’s National Ocean Service to create an online sea change calculator. The Corps and Reclamation are collaborating as coleaders in developing and implementing a training program. These agencies are collaborating with the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research’s COMET Program and the Western Water Assessment. The online course was designed to provide students with water resource planning knowledge, while the residence courses offer opportunities for gaining hands-on experience in applying that knowledge. The Corps’ climate adaptation policy states that collaborations are the most effective way to develop strategies to identify and reduce vulnerabilities to potential future climate change. were incorporated, as appropriate. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time we will send copies to the Secretaries of Defense and the Interior; the appropriate congressional committees; and other interested parties. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff members have questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-3841. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) is composed of four program areas including Civil Works, Military Construction, Real Estate, and Research and Development. To carry out its Civil Works missions nationwide, the program is organized into eight geographic divisions composed of 38 districts. Division and district geographic boundaries are generally aligned with watershed boundaries. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix III.may be found on the last page of this report. For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or click here for details. Program is implemented through nine business areas that represent the diversity of the nation’s water resource management needs. These include Navigation, Flood and Coastal Storm Damage Reduction, Hydropower, Recreation, Emergency Management, Water Supply and Executive Direction and Management. The program also provides leadership, strategic planning and executive direction and management for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Army National Guard. For more information on the program, visit www.ArmyNavy.com. For information on how to get involved, visit ArmyNavyProgram.org or call 1-800-273-8255. The Corps has a large inventory and wide variety of water management infrastructure. As of September 2012, its inventory includes 702 reservoirs and 75 hydropower facilities. In the area of navigation, the Corps’ inventory includes 12,000 miles of commercial inland waterways, 193 lock sites with 239 chambers, and 926 harbors. For flood measurement.performance measurement, visit the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ website at: http://www.usace.org/flood. reduction, the Corps inventory includes 14,501 miles of levee systems. In 2012, the National Research Council reported that the Corps’ infrastructure had an estimated value of approximately $164 billion. The Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is, according to agency records, the nation's largest wholesale water supplier. The Bureau provides water to over 31 million people and irrigation water to one out of five western farmers on 10 million acres of farm land. which produce 60 percent of the nation’s vegetables and one-quarter of its fresh fruit and nut crops. Reclamation is also the second largest producer of hydropower in the United States. According to agency records as of 2011, Reclamation’'s asset inventory includes 476 dams and dikes, creating 337 reservoirs with a total storage capacity of 245 million acre-feet of water. These plants provide an average of more than 40 megawatt of power. To carry out its mission and operations, the agency is organized into five regions. hours of energy per year. In 2011, Reclamation, estimated that the replacement value of its assets was approximately $90 billion. About two-thirds of the assets in Reclamation’s inventory are “transferred works’ The Corps is conducting pilot studies nationwide to support the development of adaptation guidance and guidance. The Corps was founded in 1864 and is based in San Francisco. It is now based in Los Angeles and has offices in San Diego, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. a portfolio of adaptation approaches. Reclamation is conducting Basin Studies to develop strategies to mitigate climate change impacts on water supplies. The Corps is conducting 15 pilot studies nationwide to test different methods and frameworks for adapting to climate change. As of September 2013, the Corps has completed 5 of these studies, and 10 others are ongoing. According to the Corps’ September 2012 report, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plans to initiate 1 additional pilot in 2013. It has completed 1 pilot study so far this year. on its climate change adaptation pilots, each study addresses a central question. For example, because the reliability of a planned flood reduction project could depend on how climate change affects future flooding, the Corps launched a pilot study. The pilot study aims to determine whether tools and data are available for the Corps to provide reliable estimates of future flooding using climate projections and climate projections. The study also aims to collect information needed to develop policy and guidance for incorporating adaptation into all agency activities, officials say. It is designed to help the Corps test new ideas, develop and utilize information at the project-level scale. Pilot study’s results supports the Corps’ effort to design an approximately $1.8 billion flood risk reduction project on the Red River of the North. Climate change is expected to contribute to long-term imbalances in water supply and demand. Reclamation is partnering with nonfederal entities to conduct focused assessments, known as Basin Studies, to identify specific water resources vulnerabilities and to develop strategies to mitigate climate change impacts on water supplies. All three of the completed Basin Studies projected climate change to result in warming and changes in precipitation that will alter the snow cover and runoff.

Summary:
The Refugee Protection Act of 2011 would make significant revisions to asylum policy. The bill would eliminate the time limits on seeking asylum in cases of changed circumstances. It would also proscribe conditions under which an asylum seeker who was a victim of terrorist coercion would not be excluded as a terrorist. The report opens with an overview of current policy, discussing the threshold of what constitutes asylum and the procedures for obtaining it. The second portion of the report identifies the top sending countries and includes a time series analysis of six selected source countries for asylum seekers. The third section of theReport analyzes asylum approvals by country of origin. conditions). If the asylum officer approves the application and the alien passes the identification and background checks, then the foreign national is granted asylum status. There has been a 79% decrease in affirmative asylum cases filed since the enactment of IIRIRA in 1996. The number of asylum cases approved more than doubled from 13,532 in FY1996 to 31,202 in FY2002, and then fell to the lowest point over the 14-year period—9,614—in FY2009. Asylum applications of aliens who are not granted asylum by asylum officers are referred to EOIR immigration judges for formal proceedings. In some respects, these applicants/aliens are allowed a "second bite at the apple" Asylum applicants in the affirmative process are not subject to the mandatory detention requirements while their applications are being adjudicated, though there is broader authority under the INA to detain aliens for other grounds. Defensive applications for asylum are raised when a foreign national is in removal proceedings and asserts. claim for asylum as a defense to his/her removal. EOIR's immigration judges and the BIA, entities in DOJ separate from the USCIS, have exclusive control over such claims. Generally, the alien raises the issue of asylum during the beginning of the removal process. The matter is then litigated in immigration court, using formal procedures such as the presentation of evidence and direct and cross examination. If the alien fails to raise the issue at the start of the process, the claim for asylum may be raised only after a successful motion. Defensive asylum claims started at a lower level in FY1996 than affirmative USCIS claims (116,877) Since that time, defensive asylum claims have dropped by 53%, to 39,279 in. The immigration judge's ultimate decision regarding both the applicant's/alien's removal and asylum application is appealable to the BIA.to reopen is filed with the court. The applicant/alien is not detained due to their asylum claim, but rather because of the broader authority in the INA to detain aliens. FY2009. EOIR approved 5,131 in FY1996 and 10,186 in FY2009. DHS' Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer must summarily exclude a foreign national arriving without proper documentation, unless the alien expresses a fear of persecution if repatriated. Absent a stated fear, the CBP officer is allowed to exclude aliens without proper. documentation from the United States without placing them in removal proceedings. This procedure is known as expedited removal. According to DHS immigration policy and procedures, CBP inspectors, as well as other DHS immigration officers, are required to ask each individual who may be subject to expedited removal the following series of "protection questions" to identify anyone who is afraid of return. Why did you leave your home country or country of last residence? Do you have any fear or concern about being returned to your homecountry or being removed from the United States? Would you be harmed if you were returned toyour home country? DoYou have any questions or is there anything else you would like to ask? If a foreign national expresses a fear of return, the alien is supposed to be detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and interviewed by a USCIS asylum officer. The asylum officer then makes the "credible fear" determination of the alien's claim. Those found to have a "c credible fear" are referred to an EOIR immigration judge, which places the asylum seeker on the defensive path to asylum. If the alien does not have a credible fear, theAlien may request that an EoIR immigrationJudge review that finding. fear" claims that USCIS has considered has steadily increased from 4,712 in FY2005 to 5,454 in FY2009. Consistent time series data on "credible fear" claims are not available before FY2005. On November 13, 2002, the former INS published a notice clarifying that certain aliens arriving by sea who are not admitted or paroled into the United States are to be placed on a waiting list. On that day, the U.S. placed more than 1,000 aliens on the list. In 2003, the Attorney General ruled that illegal mass migration by sea threatened national security because it diverts the U.S. Coast Guard and other resources from their homeland security duties. The case involved a Haitian who had had expedited removal proceedings and detained (subject to humanitarian parole) The Attorney General expanded on this rationale in his April 17, 2003, ruling that instructs EOIR immigration judges to consider "national security interests implicated by the encouragement of further unlawful mass migrations ..." in making bond determinations. come ashore in Biscayne Bay, FL, on October 29, 2002, and had been released on bond by an immigration judge. The BIA had upheld his release, but the Attorney General vacated the BIA decision. All foreign nationals seeking asylum are subject to multiple background checks in the terrorist, immigration, and law enforcement databases. Those who enter the country legally on nonimmigrant visas are screened by the consular officers at the Department of State when they apply for a visa, and all foreign nationals are inspected by CBP officers at ports of entry. by the U.S. Border Patrol or the ICE agents when they are apprehended. When aliens formally request asylum, they are sent to the nearest USCIS-authorized fingerprint site. They have all 10 fingers scanned and are subject to a full background check by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Distinct from asylum law and policy, aliens claiming relief from removal due to torture may be treated separately under regulations implementing the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (hereafter, Torture Convention) a country where there are "substantial grounds" for believing that he or she would be in danger of being tortured. The alien must meet the three elements necessary to establish torture: 1. the torture must involve the infliction of severe pain or suffering, either physical or mental, and 2. it must be intentionally inflicted. The torture must be committed by or at the acquiescence of a public official or person acting in an official capacity. Generally, an applicant for non-removal under Article 3 has the burden of proving that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured. be tortured if removed to the proposed country. If credible, the applicant's testimony may be sufficient to sustain this burden without additional corroboration. All evidence relevant to the possibility of future torture is required to be considered. If a diplomatic assurance (deemed sufficiently reliable by the Attorney General or Secretary of State) that the alien will not be tortured is obtained from the government of the country to which the alien would be repatriated, the alien's claim for asylum is likely to be successful. If not, the application for asylum will be denied. protection will not be considered further and the alien may be removed. For many years, most foreign nationals who sought asylum in the United States were from the Western Hemisphere. In FY1999, the People's Republic of China (PRC) moved to the top of the source countries for affirmative asylum applications. The U.S. now has more asylum cases filed from China than from any other country in the world, according to the U.N. refugee agency's most recent report on the number of asylum cases. asylum claims, with 4,209 new cases. Somalia followed as a leading source country with 3,125 cases in FY1999. As the overall number of asylum seekers fell in the late 1990s, the shrinking numbers from Central America contributed to the decline. Simultaneously, the number of Asylum seekers from the PRC began rising and reached 10,522 affirmative cases inFY2002. The PRC remained the leading sourcecountry throughout the 2000s. As a result, asylum seekers from PRC dominated both the affirmative and defensive asylum caseloads in FY2009. of the 39,279 defensive cases filed with EOIR. Five of the top 10 source countries of asylum seekers were Western Hemisphere nations in FY2009. The PRC asylum cases peaked in FY2002 for both affirmative and defensive claims. Affirmative asylum claims from El Salvador have steadily declined by 90.4%, from a high of 4,706 in FY 1997 to 453 in FY 2009. The "credible fear" claims have dipped by 54.6%, from 185 in FY2005 to 84 in FY2008. Asylum seekers from Ethiopia comprise the smallest number of cases among the six source countries studied. The number of asylum seekers from Haiti who do reach the United States has not fluctuated greatly over the 13-year period. All three asylum gateways of affirmative, defensive, and "credible fear" claims have each evidenced a drop since FY2006, when defensive claims peaked at 6,056. Chinese, Salvadoran and Mexican asylum claims each yielded similar levels of affirmative versus defensive asylum claims. unique fluctuations over time. Country conditions lie at the core of the principle that the U.S. will not return a foreign national to a country where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. As discussed more fully above, individualized persecution or persecution resulting from group persecution is more likely to cause asylum seekers to seek refuge in the United States. This data analysis suggests that conditions in the major source countries—whether economic, environmental, political, religious or social—were likely the driving force behind asylum seekers. identity may form the basis of the asylum claim. In the individualized instance, if the asylum seeker demonstrates that there is a reasonable possibility of suffering such persecution as an individual if he or she were to return to that country, then the fear of persecution is deemed reasonable. The group identity instance is the same as the individual instance. The asylum seeker must show that there was a pattern or practice in his or her home country of persecution. If the asylum seekers is unable or unwilling to return because of such fear, the fear is deemed to be reasonable. of a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion; then the fear of persecution is deemed reasonable. The PRC led in the number of asylum cases approved by USCIS and EOIR in FY2009 ( Figure 13 ). Moreover, abuse of human rights in the PRC has been a principal area of concern for the U.S. government. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has the authority to grant asylum. concern in the United States for many years. Presumably, PRC asylum seekers are also benefiting from the provision enabling aliens to claim asylum on the basis of persecution resulting from resistance to coercive population control policies. The portion of approved asylum cases from Haiti was consistent with its portion of asylum seekers in FY2009. Specifically, Haiti represented shares of asylum cases that USCIS and EOIR approved. that were comparable to the portion of Asylum cased filed with USCIS in FY 2009—4.5% and 4.6%. The U.S. Coast Guard interdiction of Haitians has undoubtedly suppressed the number of asylum seekers from that nation. Although the continent of Africa was not home to many of the asylum seekers discussed above, the African nations of Cameroon and Eritrea, as well as Ethiopia, appear in the top 10 source countries for asylum cases approved by USCIS and EOIR in FY2009 ( Figure 13). The emergence of the African countries in theTop 10 source nations for approved asylum cases is revealed in Table 1. Iran, Iraq, Indonesia, and Pakistan were top 20 source countries for those who received asylum from FY2000 through FY2009. Iraq and India were the only ones among these countries (along with Nepal) to be among the top 10 in FY 2009. Several top sending countries were also among the decade's top 20 approved affirmative and defensive asylum cases: Colombia, Haiti, Guatemala, and, of course, the PRC. Figure 14 presents the data for the asylee producing countries in the high-volume immigration courts from which these conclusions are drawn. The size of the disparities in asylum grant rates creates a perception of unfairness in the asylum adjudication process within the immigration court system. Researchers at Syracuse University's TRAC have been conducting analyses of the immigration courts for several years. They were among the earliest to identify wide variations in asylum outcomes that were dependent on the immigration judge. "The typical judge-by-judge denial rate—half denied more and half denied less than the average asylum seeker," the researchers say. "We could not measure the effect of case merits on case outcomes," they say. half denied less—was 65% . There were, however, eight judges who denied asylum to nine out of ten of the applicants who came before them. In the New York immigration court, for example, one judge denied only 6% in one case. TRAC's latest study of the FY2008-FY2010 period found that judge-to-judge disparities in asylum decisions have moderated since their earlier studies, but it concluded that the disparities remained substantial. The latest study was conducted by the Center for Immigration Studies. The judge-to-judge range in the San Francisco immigration court was from 32% to 92%. The disparities were also evident when immigration court decisions were analyzed by the asylum seeker's country of origin. The denial rates of Iraq asylum seekers were the lowest, spanning from zero to 4%, and their variation was also the lowest at 4%. In contrast, the New York court's denial rates ranged from 4% to 74% for PRC asylum seekers. of the asylum cases, while another denied 70% of the Asylum cases. denial rates of Salvadoran asylum seekers were the highest, spanning 90% to 98%. Some argue that given the religious, ethnic, and political violence in various countries around the world, it has become more difficult to differentiate the persecuted from the persecutors. Some express concern that U.S. sympathies for the asylum seekers caught up in the current political uprisings in the Middle East, northern Europe, and South America are being misconstrued by the media and the public. Some cite the seemingly inexplicable disparities in asylum approvals rates. Africa, and South Asia could inadvertently facilitate the entry of terrorists. Others maintain that current law does not offer adequate protections for people fleeing human rights violations or gender-based abuses. Some assert that asylum has become an alternative pathway for immigration rather than humanitarian protection provided in extraordinary cases. At the crux of the issue is the extent to which an asylum policy forged during the Cold War is adapting to the competing priorities and turbulence of the 21 st century. Some of these issues are highlighted below. attracts asylum seekers who have weak or bogus claims. Some have warned of "the ongoing separation of asylum from any grounding in the national interest" Others have maintained that migration "push" factors, such as rapid population growth, poverty, and political instability in the sending countries of asylum seekers, are factors over which the U.S. has little control. "The asylum system has become the hole in the fence for millions of dubious claimants—and a major immigration magnet in itself," one critic has concluded. Some argue that the U.S. should re-calibrate asylum policy to provide more protections for asylum seekers. These proponents have expressed a desire for the United States to reaffirm its welcome to those who have fled persecution as well as its commitment to humanitarian efforts. They have argued that some of the statutory revisions in 1996 and 2005 created unnecessary barriers for genuine asylees and that these provisions can be reformed.argued for a serious examination of the forces that propel asylum seekers to seek refuge. Research has revealed disparities in asylum decisions. Many are calling for greater congressional oversight of the immigration courts. Some are pushing for an increase in funding for immigration judges and law clerks. Others, however, contend that the problems related to disparities in Asylum decisions lie with the U.S. government. Without making the United States more vulnerable to unauthorized migrants, criminals, or terrorists, it would not be as vulnerable as it would otherwise be, they say. It would be more secure and less vulnerable to criminals and terrorists. less in the funding shortages and more in the quality of immigration judges. Some are recommending higher recruitment standards for immigration judges and more training, particularly training in the culture of asylum seekers' homelands. Some further recommend a requirement of written opinions in asylum cases. Still others maintain that the USCIS asylum officers also display disparate outcomes among similarly situated asylum cases, and that enhanced training and research support should be available. Establishing mechanisms to foster communication among asylum offices is offered as an option to improve consistency. to consider cases in pairs or panels of three asylum offers. Despite concern over the disparate decisions, there is an argument that greater congressional oversight might politicize the process. Legislative intervention to promote more consistent decisions presumably might undermine the independence of the asylum adjudicators and immigration judges. Because none of the studies that documented the disparities had access to the case facts and evidence, the rationale for decisions remains unknown and thus may indeed be justified. Immigration removal proceedings are civil in nature and, thus, do not entail the right to legal counsel that criminal proceedings do. Asylum seekers' access to counsel has arisen in recent years. Many maintain that few can adequately represent themselves. Charity and pro bono legal projects cannot afford to serve all asylum seekers, many say. Some offer that providing legal counsel is an option for addressing the disparities in outcome, they say. Many cite the GAO study, which found that many can't afford to represent themselves and need legal counsel to get a fair hearing. For confidential support, call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch, or see www.samaritans.org. asylum seekers were three times as likely to obtain asylum if they had legal representation. Some further argue that lack of counsel for a bona fide asylum seeker might result in deportation to a country where the person's life and liberty are threatened. Under current law, a foreign national has one year after the date of arrival to apply affirmatively for asylum, unless there are changed circumstances or extraordinary circumstances related to the delay in filing the application. Supporters of current law maintain that the one-year rule prevents abuses of the asylum system. Many asylum seekers who fail to file within one year of arrival subsequently receive withholding of removal or relief under the U.N. Convention Against Torture. They assert such people would have qualified for asylum but for the one-year deadline. They point out that foreign nationals have the option of seeking asylum defensively during removal proceedings. They advocate for a good cause and cite the drop in asylum applicants after the 1996 revisions to the law that added theOne-year rule to the asylum law in 1996. Asylum seekers are often detained with criminal aliens, a practice that many consider inappropriate and unwarranted. Detention is psychologically damaging, some argue, to an already fragile population. Proponents for current law warn that releasing asylum seekers in expedited removal undermines the purpose of the law. They argue that mandatory detention of asylum seekers is an essential tool in maintaining immigration control and homeland security.. Any loosening of these policies, they allege, would divert the CBP and ICE officers from their homeland security duties to track. Some have long been concerned that terrorists would seek asylum in the United States. Critics point to asylum seekers from countries of "special concern" as potential national security risks. Supporters of current law say it sends a clear signal of deterrence to aliens who consider using asylum claims as a mechanism to enter illegally. Some argue further that because asylum is a discretionary form of asylum, it should not be treated as a law enforcement tool.down wayward asylum seekers. The U.S. is home to hundreds of thousands of pending asylum cases. immigration relief, national security risks should outweigh humanitarian concerns, some argue. Others point out that asylum seekers are subject to multiple national security screenings and that if an asylum seeker is a suspected or known terrorist, the law already bars alien terrorists from entering the United States. They argue that to the extent to which security risks had existed, those risks resulted more from the limits of intelligence data on terrorists in the past rather than the expansiveness of asylum policy. Some further assert that asylees from other countries should be allowed to stay in the U.S. Some argue that the law should be amended to provide an exception for people who have been forced by terrorists to provide support. Opponents of limiting the judicial review of asylum cases contend that it would erode two traditional values of U.S. polity. The law states that an alien who commits an act that is of "special concern" may be eligible for asylum. The right to due process and freedom from repression and persecution are protected by the Constitution. It is illegal to deny asylum to someone who has committed an act of violence against the United States. he "knows, or reasonably should know, affords material support" to a terrorist organization is inadmissible. It makes no exception for instances where the alien has been coerced into providing support. Over the past decade, the United States has admitted or adjusted about 1 million foreign nationals to legal permanent resident (LPR) status each year. Overall, asylee adjustments comprised only 4% (411,972) of the 10.3 million LPRs admitted oradjusted from FY2000 through FY2009. immigration policy, asylum issues are less about the number of foreign nationals involved and more about the qualities of the policies and the efficacy of the procedures. Asylum is an adjudication of a person based upon facts, evidence, beliefs, and circumstances that might be clear at some times yet nebulous at other times. The policy tensions of asylum often pit the promotion of our humanitarian values against the prevention of fraudulent abuses. The protection of the persecuted against the security of our borders; and the obligations of our moral responsibilities internationally against the commitments of our social priorities domestically. balance of these competing concerns may be shaken by a crisis in a neighboring nation or by larger world events. The U.S. Congress plays the key role in considering when and whether revision or re-calibration of asylum law and policies is warranted, says John Avlon, a professor of law at the University of California, Los Angeles. He says Congress should consider whether a change in asylum law or policies is in the best interests of the country as a whole, rather than just the asylum seekers.

Summary:
PPACA requires that private insurers offering group or individual health insurance coverage report annually on the various components that are used to calculate their MLRs. Private insurers first reported this information in 2012, based on their 2011 experience. The MLR data that insurers report to CMS include the following components, as required by law: Medical claims, expenses for quality improvement (QI) activities, non-claims costs, taxes and fees, and community benefit expenditures. The remaining amount of premiums that an insurer does not spend on the components of medical claims, QI activities, and non- claims costs, will be referred to as the insurer’s “premium surplus” Insurers’ spending on QI expenses did not vary across markets. Insurers in the small group market spent a higher share on agents’ and brokers’ fees and commissions than insurers in the individual and large group markets. In 2012 small group insurers spent about 42 percent of their total non-claims costs on agents' and brokers' fees and commission compared to the 23 percent that large group insurers spend. In 2011 and 2012, insurers paid about $1.1 billion in total rebates to enrollees and policyholders who paid premiums. rebates in 2012. These amounts would each have decreased by about 75 percent had agents’ and brokers’ fees and commissions been excluded from the MLR and rebate calculations. Of the $1.1 billion in total rebates that insurers paid in 2011, insurers in the large group market paid 37 percent of this total, or $405 million in rebates. In 2012, the largest amount was paid in the small group market (about $207 million) These rebate calculations are based on the assumption that insurers did not make other changes during this time that would have affected their MLRs. MLR requirements were one factor among a variety of factors that influenced their decisions regarding premium rates. Two of these insurers told us that the MLR requirements have generally moderated their premium increases. All eight insurers we interviewed told us the PPACA MLr requirements have not affected where they do business and have had no effect, or a very limited effect, on their spending on QI activities since 2011. Five of the eight insurers also commented that the 2013 PP ACA MLR calculation, which is based on a 3-year period including 2013 and the prior 2 years, will likely reduce some of the effects of year-to-year variability. One insurer, who paid rebates in 2011, noted that it would not have owed rebates had the MLR formula been based on 3 years of insurers’ experience. Another insurer told us that it will likely owe rebates for 2013 because MLR data it reported in 2011 and 2012 will be averaged into 2013. The insurer added that over time, however, it believes the 3-yearMLR formula should be beneficial for the insurer by reducing its rebates over the next 3 years. the likelihood of owing rebates.

Summary:
The UN headquarters buildings in New York City are in need of renovation. Over the last 50 years there have been no major renovations or upgrades to the buildings or their systems. In September 2005, the headquarters complex was shut down and the staff sent home because a fire broke out in one of the buildings. The UN headquarters complex lacks fire sprinklers, has a deteriorating window structure, and is vulnerable to catastrophic electrical failures. The buildings do not meet current safety, fire and building codes and does not meet UN technology or security requirements. main breaker for electrical power to the top floors of the Secretariat building failed, causing it to fuse to the electrical panel. This failure could have resulted in a major fire. As host country, the United States financed construction of the original complex by providing the UN with a no-interest loan. The rest of the complex was built between 1960 and 1982 and funded through the UN’s regular budget or private donations. In December 2002, the General Assembly endorsed the CMP to renovate the UN headquarters complex. May 2003, we reported that the resulting renovation planning was reasonable, but that additional management controls and oversight were needed. In April 2006, the UN appropriated $23.5 million to finance the renovation’s preconstruction phase and committed $77 million to construction of temporary conference space and supplementary office space rental. The General Assembly has not yet decided whether to approve implementation of the CMP. In a February 2003 resolution, the General Assembly stressed the importance of oversight in implementing the C MP. that all relevant oversight bodies, such as OIOS, initiate immediate oversight activities. In our 2003 report on the CMP, we noted that OIos assigned one staff member to begin researching the C MP on a part-time basis. In July 2005, OiOS reported that it had two auditors reviewing the Cmp. OI OS derives its funding from (1) regular budget resources, which are funds from assessed contributions from member countries, and (2) regular contributions from the UN General Assembly. states that cover normal, recurrent activities such as the core functions of the UN Secretariat and (2) extrabudgetary resources. OIOS audited some aspects of the Oil for Food program and identified hundreds of weaknesses and irregularities. But it lacked the resources and independence needed to audit the entire program, the authors say. The report was published by the International Institute for Social and Economic Research (IISER) on November 14. For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or click here for details. to provide full and effective oversight of this large, costly, and complex UN effort. As the program was implemented, the Oil for Food program was further weakened by inadequate attention to internal controls. In addition to oversight, an effective procurement process is one of the keys to success for any large scale construction project. For more than a decade, experts have called on the UN to correct serious weaknesses in its procurement process. The UN procurement process has been under increasing stress in recent years as a result. procurement spending has more than tripled to keep pace with a rapidly growing peacekeeping program. The UN Department of Management, through its 70-person UN Procurement Service, is ultimately responsible for developing UN procurement policies. Because the UN is a multilateral institution, our oversight authority does not directly extend to the UN, but instead extends through the United States’ membership in the organization. In recognition of this factor, we conduct UN-related work only in response to specific requests from committees with jurisdiction over UN matters. The UN is vulnerable to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement due to a range of weaknesses in existing oversight practices. The General Assembly mandate creating OIOS calls for it to be operationally independent. In practice, however, OI OS’s independence is impaired by constraints that UN funding arrangements impose. In our April 2006 report, we recommended that the Secretary of State and the Permanent Representative of the U.S. to the UN be in charge of OIos. to the UN work with member states to support budgetary independence for OIOS. In passing the resolution that established OI OS in August 1994, the General Assembly stated that the office should exercise operational independence. In addition, the Institute should take into account the independence of the office when preparing the budget proposal. Both the Department of State and OIos generally agreed with our findings and recommendation. The UN mandate for OiOS was followed by a Secretary-General’s bulletin in September 1994 stating that OI SOS discharge its responsibilities without any hindrance or need for prior clearance. UN funding arrangements severely limit OIOS’s ability to respond to changing circumstances and reallocate its resources. UN funding arrangements also limit the ability of an audit organization to fulfill its mandate. International auditing standards also state that financial regulations and the rules of an international institution shouldn’t restrict an audit group from fulfilling its mandate, according to the UN Office of Internal Auditors (OIOS) The UN office of internal auditors is based in New York City and has offices across the world. its multiple funding sources, OIOS locations worldwide, or its operating divisions to address changing priorities. In addition, the movement of staff positions or funds between regular and extrabudgetary resources is not allowed. For example, one section in the Internal Audit Division may have exhausted its regular budget travel funds, while another section may have travel funds available that are financed by extrab budgetary peacekeeping resources. It would breach UN financial regulations and rules if it moved resources between the two budgets. Since 1996, an increasing share of OIOSís total budget is comprised of extrabudgetary resources. The majority of OiOS’s staff (about 69 percent) is funded with extrabbudgetary resources, which increased due to audits and investigations of peacekeeping operations, including issues related to sexual exploitation and abuse. OIos is based in Washington, D.C., and has offices in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, DC. The organization is funded by a combination of its regular budget and its extrab budget, which has increased in nominal terms. dependent on UN funds and programs and other UN entities for resources, access, and reimbursement for the services it provides. OIOS negotiates the terms of work and payment for services with the manager of the program it intends to examine, and heads of these entities have the right to deny funding for oversight work. By denying OIos funding, UN entities could avoid OI OS audits or investigations, says the report. The report was published by the International Institute of Social and Economic Research. and high-risk areas could potentially be excluded from timely examination. For example, allowing the heads of programs the right to deny funding to internal audit activities prevented OIOS from examining high- risk areas in the UN Oil for Food program, where billions of dollars were subsequently found to have been misused. In some cases, fund and program managers have disputed fees charged by OiOS for investigative services rendered. 40 percent of the $2 million billed by OIos after it completed its work is currently in dispute, and since 2001, less than half of the entities have paid. OIOS officials say the office has no authority to enforce payment for services rendered. There is no appeal process, no supporting administrative structure, and no adverse impact on an agency that does not pay or pays only a portion of the bill. In our April 2006 report concerning OIOS, we recommended that the Secretary of State and the Permanent Representative of the United States to the UN work with member states to support budgetary independence. In commenting on the official draft of that report, OI OS said it had no comment on that report. GAO found that current UN financial regulations and rules are very restrictive, severely limiting OIOS’s ability to respond to changing circumstances. GAO: State fully agreed with our findings that UN member states need to ensure that OiOS has budgetary independence. State: State does not believe that multiple funding sources have impeded OI OS’S budgetary flexibility. OIos formally adopted the GAO‘s recommendations. Oios stated that observations made in our report were consistent with OI SOS’’�s internal assessments and external peer reviews. the Institute for Internal Auditors’ (IIA) international standards for the professional practice of internal auditing in 2002. Since then, OIOS has begun to develop and implement the key components of effective oversight. However, the office has yet to fully implement them. The office's shortcomings could undermine the office's effectiveness in carrying out its functions as the UN’s main internal oversight body. Effective oversight demands reasonable adherence to professional auditing standards. In our April 2006 report, we recommended that the Secretary of State and the Permanent Representative of the United States. OIOS has adopted a risk management framework to link the office’s annual work plans to risk-based priorities, but it has not fully implemented this framework. The UN will work with member states to support OIOS’S efforts to more closely adhere to international auditing standards. OIos began implementing a riskmanagement framework in 2001 for prioritizing the allocation of resources to those areas that have the greatest exposure to fraud, waste, and abuse. It includes plans for organization-wide risk assessments to categorize and prioritize risks. risk areas facing each entity for which OIOS has oversight authority. As of April 2006, out of 25 entities that comprise major elements of its “oversight universe,’ only three risk assessments had been completed. As a result, “OIOS officials cannot currently provide reasonable assurance that the entities they choose to examine are those that pose the highest risk,” the report says. OIos officials told us they plan to assign risk areas more consistently to audits proposed. in their annual work plan during the planning phase so that, by 2008, at least 50 percent of their work is based on a systematic risk assessment. Although OIOS’s annual reports contain references to risks facing the UN organization, the reports do not provide an overall assessment of the status of these risks or the consequence to the organization if the risks are not addressed. For instance, in February 2005, the Independent Inquiry Committee reported that many of the Oil for Food program's deficiencies were not described in the annual reports submitted to the UN. OIOS does not have an annual report to assess risks and controls. The General Assembly would have to determine the appropriate vehicle for such a new reporting requirement. The official agreed that OIOS should communicate to senior management on areas where the office has not been able to examine significant risk and control issues. The office has stated that the office does have the ability to assess risk and controls, but that such an assessment does not belong in the annual report in its current form, which focuses largely on the activities of the office. not have adequate resources, they do not have a mechanism in place to determine appropriate staffing levels to help justify budget requests, except for peacekeeping oversight services. For peacekeeping audit services, OIOS does have a metric—endorsed by the General Assembly—that provides one professional auditor for every $100 million in the annual peacekeeping budget. For the CMP, OiOS reported that it has been difficult to support staff increases in oversight areas that lack a comparable metric, according to officials. that it had extrabudgetary funds from the CMP for one auditor on a short-term basis, but that the level of funding was not sufficient to provide the oversight coverage intended by the General Assembly. To provide additional oversight coverage, OIOS assigned an additional auditor exclusively to the C MP, using funds from its regular budget. UN personnel records show that OIos staff took a total of more than $100,000 in fees and expenses in 2013. OI OS does not formally require or systematically track staff training to provide reasonable assurance that all staff are maintaining and acquiring professional skills. than 400 training courses offered by the Office of Human Resources Management in 2005. Since 2004, OIOS has subscribed to IIA’s online training service that offers more than 100 courses applicable to auditors. The Office does not formally require staff training, nor does it systematically track training to provide reasonable assurance that all staff are maintaining and acquiring professional skills. OI OS policy manuals list no minimum training requirement, although they gather some information on their use of training funds for their annual training report. to the UN Office of Human Resources Management, they do not maintain an office wide database to systematically track all training taken by their staff. In our April 2006 report on OIOS, we also recommended that the Secretary of State and the Permanent Representative of the United States to the UN work with member states to support OI OS’s efforts to more closely adhere to international auditing standards. In commenting on the official draft of that report, OIos and State agreed with our overall conclusions and recommendations. The UN has yet to finalize its CMP procurement strategy. To the extent that it relies on current UN processes, implementation of the planned renovation is vulnerable to the procurement weaknesses that we have identified. We have identified problems affecting the UN’s bid protest process, headquarters contract review committee, vender rosters, procurement workforce, ethics guidance for procurement personnel, and procurement manual. In our April 2006 report on UN procurement, we recommended that the Secretary of State and the Permanent Representative of the United States to the UN work with member states to encourage the UN. The UN has not established an independent process to consider vendor protests. The 1994 recommendation of a high-level panel of international procurement experts that it do so as soon as possible. Such a process would provide reasonable assurance that vendors are treated fairly when bidding. It would also help alert senior UN management to situations involving questions about UN compliance. An independent bid would help ensure that the UN conducts business with qualified vendors, and to take other steps to improve UN procurement. The UN would also address problems facing its principal contract-review committee. The General Assembly endorsed the principle of independent bid protests in 1994. Several nations, including the United States, provide vendors with an independent process to handle complaints. The UN’s lack of an independent bid protest process limits the transparency of its procurement process by not providing a means for a vendor to protest, says the UN Commission on International Trade Law. It also does not provide a way for vendors to file complaints with an office or official who is independent of the procurement process, it adds. The UN Procurement Service directs its vendors to file protests to the chief and then to his or her immediate supervisor. If handled through an independent process, vendor complaints could alert senior UN officials and UN auditors to the failure of UN procurement staff to comply with stated procedures. The U.N. hired a consultant to evaluate the internal controls of its procurement operations. One of the consultant’s conclusions was that the internal control of the procurement operations was inadequate. The consultant also found that the UN had not followed its own procurement procedures properly. UN needs to establish an independent bid protest process for suspected wrongdoing. The number of contracts reviewed by the committee has increased by almost 60 percent since 2003. The committee’s chairman and members told us that the committee does not have the resources to keep up with its expanding workload. They said that the UN needs to set up an independent third-party evaluation as well as arbitration, due process, and formal resolution for all reports. It also needs to create an independent body to investigate allegations of wrongdoing. The committee is charged with evaluating proposed contracts worth more than $200,000. Concerns regarding the committee’s structure and workload have led UN auditors to conclude that the committee cannot properly review contract proposals. It may thus recommend contracts for approval that are inappropriate and have not met the committee's requirements, the report said. The committee is responsible for advising the Department of Management as to whether the contracts are in accordance with UN Financial Regulations and Rules and other UN policies. The report was published on Wednesday. The UN does not consistently implement its process for helping to ensure that it is conducting business with qualified vendors. As a result, the UN may be vulnerable to favoring certain vendors or dealing with unqualified vendors. In 1994, a high-level group of international procurement experts concluded that the UN’s vendor roster was outdated, inaccurate, and inconsistent across all the UN member states. The UN has long had difficulties in maintaining effective rosters of qualified vendors, OIOS said in a report. In 2003, an OIOS report found that the Procurement Service’s roster contained questionable vendors. As of 2005, the roster was not fully reliable for identifying qualified vendors that could bid on contracts. The UN has not demonstrated a commitment to improving its professional procurement staff through training, says the report. The report was published by the Open International Organization (OIOS) on October 1, 2005. For more information on OIos, visit www.oios.org. The UN has relied disproportionately on the actions of its staff to safeguard its resources. Recent studies indicate that Procurement Service staff lack knowledge of UN procurement policies. Most procurement staff lack professional certifications attesting to their procurement education, training, and experience. The UN has not established requirements for procurement staff to obtain continuous training, resulting in inconsistent levels of training across the procurement workforce. Furthermore, UN staff have not been trained in a career development path, and other key human capital practices critical to attracting, developing and retaining a qualified professional workforce. officials acknowledged that the UN has not committed sufficient resources to a comprehensive training and certification program for its procurement staff. The UN has been considering the development of specific ethics guidance for procurement officers for almost a decade, in response to General Assembly directives dating back to 1998. Such guidance would include a career path for professional advancement for procurement staff and could encourage staff to undertake progressive training and work experiences. The Procurement Service has drafted such guidance, but has made only limited progress toward adopting it. declaration of ethics responsibilities for procurement staff and a code of conduct for vendors. The UN has yet to include guidance for construction procurement into its procurement manual. In June 2005, a UN consultant recommended that the UN develop separate guidelines in the manual for the planning and execution of construction projects. These guidelines could be useful in planning and executing CMP procurement. Moreover, the UN has not updated its procurement Manual since January 2004 to reflect current UN procurement policy. As a result, procurement staff may not be aware of changes to procurement procedures that theUN has adopted. over the past 2 years. The Procurement Service has been unable to allocate resources needed to update the manual since that time. In our April 2006 report on UN procurement, we recommended that the Secretary of State and the Permanent Representative of the United States to the UN work with member states to encourage the UN to establish an independent bid protest mechanism, address problems facing its principle contract-review committee, implement a process to help ensure that it conducts business with qualified vendors, and to take other steps. steps to improve UN procurement. The Department of State stated that it welcomed our report and endorsed its recommendations. The UN did not provide us with written comments. To conduct our study of UN oversight, we reviewed relevant UN and OIOS reports, manuals, and program documents, as well as the international auditing standards of the IIA and the International Organization of Supreme Auditing Institutions. The IIA standards apply to internal audit activities, not to investigations, monitoring, evaluation, and inspection activities. of international standards for non-audit oversight activities. We met with senior State officials in Washington, D.C., and senior officials with the U.S. Missions to the UN in New York, Vienna, and Geneva. At these locations, we also met with the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services management officials and staff. We reviewed relevant OIOS program documents, manuals, and reports. To assess the reliability of OiOS’s funding, we looked at its funding sources. GAO: If implemented, the CMP will be a large and unique endeavor for the UN. We have identified numerous weaknesses with the existing procurement process that could impact implementation. Long-standing weaknesses in the UN’s procurement office have left UN procurement funds highly vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse. Sustained leadership at the UN will be needed to correct these weaknesses and establish a procurement system capable of fully supporting the UN's expanding needs.

Summary:
The ability to fight and win two nearly simultaneous major theater wars is the cornerstone of U.S. defense strategy. For planning purposes, the military assumes that the two most likely places where these wars would take place are Korea and Southwest Asia. Mobilization of U.,S. forces for such conflicts requires a global system of integrated land, sea, and air resources, and supplies already stored overseas. The fleet of civilian and military passenger and cargo aircraft and the En Route System (ERS) airfields provide the critical air component. The ERS provides the capabilities needed to handle ongoing peacetime operations and requirements associated with smaller-scale contingency operations. For example, ERS bases were used extensively during recent operations in Kosovo. U.S. bases through ERS airfields and on to their eventual destinations at bases located in or near the war zones. The base must have the ramp space to park the aircraft and perform required maintenance, the equipment to load and unload cargo if needed, and the equipment needed to quickly refuel the aircraft. We discussed issues related to the basing of combat aircraft in our recent report on Kosovo operations, but not ERS operations. As shown in figure 1, the 13 ERS airfields are located mostly in Europe and throughout the Pacific. Each is planned to be within an area 3,500 nautical miles from the U.S. and from the war zones. This distance is based on the maximum efficient range, which is determined by climate and proximity to the anticipated war zones, among other factors. Operation of the ERS airfields is shared between the host nation, which owns the airfield, and a number of DOD organizations. Host nation responsibilities vary and are documented in the Status of Forces Agreement for each country. U.S. organizations with responsibility for the airfields include the Air Force, who provides day-to-day operations for all but two of the air fields. According to officials, while space is sometimes shared, it is not shared with the host country and is usually owned by the host. In the event of overlapping major theater wars in Korea and Southwest Asia, the 13 ERS airfields would not currently have enough capacity to move the required amounts of personnel and equipment. DOD expects the shortfall to be largely eliminated by 2005. But the assumptions and modeling approach DOD uses in its calculations raise some uncertainty about the precise size of the shortfall. Some study assumptions tend to underestimate the shortfall, while the modeling approach used could overestimate it, authors say. The net effect of these factors on estimates of ERS capacity in 2005 is unclear. airfields will still be short of requirements at the end of 2005. Capacity requirements for the ERS could be raised even higher if other ongoing missions (such as peacekeeping) were added, further increasing the shortfall. DOD needs to reanalyze ERS to determine whether there might be any extra capacity available to handle the additional missions or whether more capacity must be built. Officials were unsure when this issue would be tackled. U.S. presence overseas has shrunk to the shrinkage to the Cold War. Most (58 percent) of the costs are associated with bases in the Pacific region. Host nations and U.S. allies are expected to fund about 55 percent of the total. It is unclear whether all the projects will be completed as planned, as the projects must compete with each other and with other DOD projects for funding and face other uncertainties. Since the end of the.review in July 2000, the Pentagon has spent more than $1.2 trillion on military operations in the Middle East and Africa. Cold War, many U.S. military locations overseas have been closed and their personnel relocated to bases in the continental United States. Transportation Command officials state that with this drawdown in the 1990s, the ERS lost many of its facilities and much of its flexibility. Today, ERS has access to only 13 locations, compared with 45 in the early 1990s. As a result, the remaining bases have become much more important as the only airfield options available for en- route mobilization support. ERS capacity was about $1.2 billion for fiscal years 1997 through 2006. The estimate was changed to $2.0 billion shortly after that. No one is responsible for monitoring the overall cost to eliminate the shortfall, officials say. The $1-billion estimate was simply carried forward from an estimate developed in the mid-1990s in conjunction with a major review of overall mobility requirements. That estimate was based on a quick world tour by a team of engineers who covered what at the time were about 35 ERS bases. The estimated cost to eliminate the shortfall has grown to about $2 billion, officials say. The increase reflects changes in the bases making up the ERS since the mid-1990s. Most ERS airfields were built during or immediately after World War II, Transportation Command officials tell us. The Air Mobility Command agreed to query all of the various commands involved in the E RS to determine the current cost to eliminating the shortfall. The estimated cost has grown from $1.5 billion to $2billion. The $2 billion will fund repairs and improvements to fuel systems, runways, ramp space, and other base elements. The largest construction cost category is associated with fuel system repair and improvement. According to Transportation and Air Mobility Command officials, the standard fuel systems at current ERS bases were designed and built during the early 1950s and had an estimated life span of 30 to 40 years. At some bases refueling must be carried out by trucks, rather than airplanes. Some components were built by host nations even earlier. by more modern pipeline and hydrant systems. At other bases, hydrants are antiquated or have deteriorating lines that slow and sometimes interrupt fueling operations altogether. Bases in the Pacific region total about $1.14 billion (58 percent) compared to about $825 million (42 percent) for the European bases. Officials emphasize that the proposed projects are intended largely to replace capability lost due to deterioration or base closures. In fact, only 25 of the 516 projects provide additional capacity. About 55 percent of the $2 billion in ERS construction funding will come from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The remaining 45 percent is expected to come from a variety of U.S. programs. Japan has provided some $21 billion for projects under this program, which started in 1979. It is unclear whether all the construction projects will be completed as planned. projects. Remaining projects either upgrade existing capacity to current environmental, safety, or operational standards or replace/repair equipment due to obsolescence or failure. DOD infrastructure is grossly under funded, with facilities currently funded for replacement every 250 years. Projects planned in later years are more vulnerable to funding changes since they have not yet been spent. Officials also note that host nation involvement in funding can create some uncertainty in construction timetables. For example, DOD had to reassign fiscal year 2002 funding for construction projects at one ERS airfield in Europe to other DOD projects because of the host nation's involvement in the project. (See p. 18 for a discussion of DOD problems in infrastructure management.) of a 2- to 3-year delay in host government approval of funding requirements. According to officials, the host government was concerned about sovereignty issues involved in its membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Formal approval has now been received for these projects, and funding has been shifted by about 1 year. Most of the projects have not yet started construction. As of October 2000, about 4 percent ($75.0 million) of total funding had been spent on completed projects with another 10 percent ($194.6 million) spent on projects in progress. About 19 percent of funding under U.S. programs was associated with projects that had either begun or completed work, compared to about 10 percent of host nation and allied funding. Only recently has the ERS begun to receive high priority for funding, Transportation Command officials say. In the past, about $1.5 billion has been spent on ERS projects, but that figure is expected to rise. The ERS program is funded through 2006, but future funding is subject to future budgetary constraints and uncertainties. Air Mobility Command leaders realized how critical the airfields were. To publicize the problem and obtain higher priority, the Air Mobility Command proclaimed 1997 the “Year of the En Route System” However, even with the increased priority, officials told us that it still takes many years to move projects through the budget. The U.S. Air Force has more than 2,000 airfields across the world. The Air Force is home to more than 100,000 military personnel, including more than 1,000 Air Force families. Despite the strategic importance of the ERS, critical information on ERS plans and operations is not available. DOD has not carried out overall cost-benefit studies to document the rationale for its decisions. The ERS has no centralized oversight system to provide readily available, up-to-date data on the condition and readiness of the airfields. Sound strategic planning that clearly lays out missions and goals, needed resources, priorities, strategies, measures of performance, and assigned responsibilities is crucial to achieving program success. gaps in DOD’s overall strategic planning processes that have led to difficulties in assessing performance in a variety of areas. Management of the ERS is fragmented among at least four unified commands and six subcommands, three services, host nations, and other organizations such as the Defense Logistics Agency. A formal, written strategic plan that lays out missions and goals, guiding principles and priorities, performance measures, and monitoring mechanisms is also needed. Without such structure ERS operations are prone to a higher risk of inefficiency in the form of confusing and overlapping lines of authority.

Summary:
GAO: 23 federal housing programs target or have special features for the elderly. It says waiting lists for many types of subsidized housing, including housing for elderly, are long. GAO: HUD and USDA programs target families at lower income levels, but not all. Agency: Only 4 of 23 programs require property owners to provide supportive services to the elderly, and those are not required to do so by HUD or the USDA. The federal government’s system for providing assistance to low-income people is highly fragmented, it says. the delivery of meals and nonmedical supportive services to elderly and disabled residents of public and multifamily housing. While HUD provides up to 40 percent of the cost of supportive services, grantees must pay at least 50 percent. Like the Elderly/Disabled Services Coordinator Program under ROSS, the Congregate Housing Services Program has provided no new grants since 1995. Congress has provided funds to extend expiring grants on an annual basis. The Neighborhood Networks program encourages property owners, managers, and residents. of HUD-insured and -assisted housing to develop computer centers. HUD does not fund each center’s planned costs but encourages property owners to seek cash grants, in-kind support, and donations from sources such as state and local governments, educational institutions, private foundations, and corporations. The ROSS grant program links public housing residents with appropriate services. This program differs from the Service Coordinator Program in that it is designed specifically for public housingResidents. The program is free and open to the public. ROSS program has five funding categories, including Resident Service Delivery Models for the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities. Resident Services funds can be used to hire a project coordinator and assess residents’ needs for supportive services. The Elderly/Disabled Service Coordinator Program has not provided new grants since 1995 but still services existing grants. The Service coordinator program provides funding for managers of multifamily properties designated for the elderly and disabled. The program is funded by federal, state, and local assistance programs. to hire coordinators to assist residents in obtaining supportive services from community agencies. Service coordinators can be funded through competitive grant funds, residual receipts (excess income from a property), or rent increases. According to HUD’s fiscal year 2003 Performance and Accountability Report, service coordinators were serving more than 111,000 units in elderly properties. Elderly residents of public and federally subsidized multifamily housing can also receive supportive services through partnerships between property owners and community agencies, according to HUD. owners and local organizations and through programs provided by HHS. For example, property owners can establish relationships with local nonprofit organizations, including churches, to ensure that residents have access to the services that they need. In Greensboro, North Carolina, we found several examples of such partnerships. At their discretion, propertyOwners may establish relationships that give the elderly access to meals, transportation, and housekeeping and personal care services. Although GAO did not obtain data on the extent to which such services are made available at all public and federally subsidized multifamily housing, in site visits to HUD and USDA multifamily properties, we find several examples. In Plain City, Ohio, residents of a Section 515 property receive meals five times a week in the community’s senior center. A local hospital donates the food and a nursing home facility prepares it. The senior center uses the funds collected from the lunch for its activities. In Carolina, Dolan Manor, a Section 202 housing development, has established a relationship with a volunteer group from a local church. The volunteer group provides a variety of services such as transportation for the residents. Guthrie Properties, also a Section 515 property, has established a relationship with the local Area Agency on Aging. The agency assists residents of Guthrie Properties in obtaining a variety of services, including meals and transportation to a senior center. Some elderly residents of public and federally subsidized housing may also obtain health-related services through programs run by HHS. For example, HHS’s Public Housing Primary Care Program provides public housing residents with access to affordable comprehensive primary and preventive health care. The United Way provides most of the funding for the senior center in Guthrie. The program awards grants to public and nonprofit private entities to establish the clinics. The organizations must work with public housing authorities to obtain the physical space for the clinics and to establish relationships with residents. Currently, there are 35 grantees, 3 of which are in rural areas. According to a program administrator, although clinics are not specifically geared toward public housing designated for the elderly, they can be established at such properties. Elderly residents of federally subsidized housing may also be eligible for the program's assistance. the Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) Waiver Program, which is administered by HHS’s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. HUD has identified these waivers as an innovative model for assisting the frail elderly in public housing. In addition, eligible elderly residents of federally subsidized housing may receive health care through the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) Like the HCBS waiver program, this program, like PACE, is also administered by the CDC. enables eligible elderly individuals to obtain needed services without having to live in an institutional setting. The program integrates Medicare and Medicaid financing to provide comprehensive, coordinated care to older adults eligible for nursing homes. Figure 1 provides information on the housing assistance programs that can use federally funded supportive services programs that assist the elderly. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement. I would be happy to answer any questions at this time. For further information on this testimony, please contact David G. Wood at (202) 512-8678.

Summary:
To protect the U.S., DOD relies on a complex array of computer-dependent and mutually supportive organizational components. Software code that is poorly developed or purposely injected with malicious code could be used to disrupt these and other DOD information systems. DOD has reported that countries hostile to the United States are focusing resources on developing information warfare strategies. Information systems technology was the most sought after militarily critical technology by these entities, the DSS says. The National Industrial Security Program Operation Manual establishes mandatory procedures for the safeguarding of classified information that is released to contractors. limits access to U.S. citizens with appropriate security clearances and establishes eligibility policies for contractors determined to have foreign ownership, control, or influence. Further, an additional DOD directive requires programs containing classified military information to have controls to prevent the unauthorized release of this information to foreign recipients. In addition, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) controls foreign access to defense articles and services through the establishment of the export license and authorization process. U.s. entities, including defense contractors, may apply to the Department of State for authorization to export controlled information and technology to qualified foreign recipients, DOD estimates that it spends about 40 percent of its Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation budget on software. About $8 billion of that amount may be spent on reworking software because of quality-related issues. Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute (SEI) has developed models and methods that define and determine organizations’ software process maturity. Better software development practices are seen as a way to reduce the cost of software development in the U.S. and around the world. number of software defects and therefore improve overall software quality, but alone the practices cannot be expected to address malicious software development activities intended to breach security. DOD’s approach to software development and acquisition generally is more cautious than other agencies’. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Networks and Information Integration) and the Federal Aviation Administration Chief Information Office are co- sponsoring a project aimed at developing ways to provide safety and security assurance extensions to integrated software maturity models. The project will be led by SEI and will include the Department of Energy, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and SEI. Despite risks associated with foreign access to defense systems, DOD acquisition policy does not require program managers to identify and manage the amount of foreign involvement for software development in weapon systems. DOD information system security requirements focus on operational software threats, rather than potential threats posed by software developers. While recent DOD initiatives could increase DOD’s focus on software security, efforts to date have not translated into greater knowledge for program managers about foreign software development activities, the authors say. The authors say DOD should focus on improving overall quality, leaving decision making on software suppliers and security with individual program managers. program managers discretion in managing foreign suppliers used for software development. This policy consists of general guidance for meeting overall acquisition management principles. For software acquisition, program managers are encouraged to develop open software systems architectures, use COTS computer system products, and allow incremental improvements based on reusable software. All of these practices, while having the potential to benefit cost and schedule for weapon programs, could result in greater software vulnerabilities by introducing potentially malicious code from unknown software. The policy instructs program managers to use systems engineering practices, when applicable, that focus on cost, schedule, and performance. DOD acquisition policy requires major weapon programs to maintain information about the software project’s size, effort, schedule, and quality. It does not require program managers to identify and manage suppliers or the potential security risks from foreign suppliers. On October 30, 2002, DOD issued the Interim Defense Acquisition Guidebook, which contained the following security considerations to be used when foreign nationals participate in software development. The change control process shall indicate whether foreign nationals, in any way, participated inSoftware development, modification, or remediation. Foreign nationals employed by contractors. or subcontractors to develop, modify, or remediate software code specifically for DOD shall each have a security clearance commensurate with the level of the program in which the software is being used. Primary vendors on DOD contracts may have subcontractors who employ cleared foreign nationals that work only in a certified or accredited environment. DOD software with coding done in foreign environments or by foreign nationals shall be reviewed by software quality assurance personnel for malicious code. Vendors of COTS software that demonstrate efforts to minimize the security risks associated with foreign nationals will be given preference in product selection or evaluation. Laws, requirements, and policies that are intended to provide information assurance for operational security do not fully address risks during software development. Under the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002, all executive agencies, including DOD, are required to ensure that information security policies, procedures, and practices are adequate. Air Force, Army, and Navy regulations implement DOD-wide acquisition policies. As such, they defer to DOD guidance and do not specifically address software security issues and related risks that may be inherent with foreign software. The process includes a requirement for a threat assessment, but does not articulate how this information should be developed or reported. While the process is mandatory, the implementation details may be tailored and, in some cases, integrated with other acquisition activities and documentation. While DOD initiatives have begun to recognize potential risks from foreign software suppliers, this is not always the case within the weapon programs where software is developed or acquired, the authors say. They say DOD has taken steps to strengthen software acquisition practices, but has yet to implement practices to better manage software development security risks in weapon programs. Onboard software is that which actually runs the weapon system, even if that software is not located on the main component (aircraft, missile, satellite, etc). Onboard software for a missile system could include software located on a remote platform used to guide the missile toward its target. In 9 of the systems we reviewed, either prime contractors or major subcontractors conducted software development for the onboard systems. Officials for 13 of the programs reviewed had almost no insight into the use of foreign developers for any COTS software. Programs had opportunities to gain such knowledge through practices designed to collect other information. Many of the program offices in our review were able to obtain some information on software suppliers. For 11 of the 16 systems, program managers have not identified foreign supplier involvement in software development as a significant risk to the security of their weapon systems. The relative importance of software security in risk mitigation efforts also varied greatly across the systems we reviewed, the report says.. In at least two cases, program software managers became aware of foreign software suppliers while collecting information requested for this review.

Summary:
Social Security plays an important role in reducing poverty, not only among the aged but among children as well. In addition to receiving Social Security benefits in their own right, children may economically benefit from Social Security by living with other family members who receive benefits. Social Security Administration (SSA) data indicate that in December 2012, 3.3 million Social Security beneficiaries (5.7% of all beneficiaries) were children under the age of 18. Average monthly benefits of children of disabled workers were lowest, about $323. The U.S. Census Bureau Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) data are used in this report. The most recent SIPP data are from the 2008 panel, which is designed to interview a representative sample of families every four months over a 64-month period. The SIPP collects detailed information on family composition, labor force participation, income, and program participation among families and their members in each of the 64 months they are included in the survey. With children, other data sources must be used. CRS analysis of SIPP data for April 2013 indicates that among an estimated 73.0 million children under age 18, an estimated 8.5 million (11.6%) lived in families in which one or more family members received Social Security. This is over two and one-half times the number of children estimated to receive Social Security benefits based on the administrative data discussed above from four months earlier (3.3 million in December 2012). As discussed in greater detail, the methodology used in this report is described in the Appendix. Among 8.5 million children living in families that received Social Security in April 2013 based on SIPP data, an estimated 3.2 million (37%) were in families in which Social Security was reported as having been received on behalf of at least one of the children in the family. Another 1.9 million (22%) lived in families where a parent or guardian reported receiving Social Security benefits. These 5.1 million children are grouped together in analyses that follow as child beneficiaries and children of parents or guardians that receive Social Security. Security benefits may have been received by an extended family member (e.g., grandparent, aunt or uncle, cousin, niece or nephew) For this latter group, children may incidently be affected by Social Security, but not directly as a matter of policy aimed at them. For such purposes, poverty status of children must be estimated both before and after counting families' income from Social Security. Also, the after-the-fact comparison of poverty status by family Social Security receipt doesn't take into account the effect that Social Security itself has in reducing poverty. Social Security lifted nearly 2.0 million children above the poverty line in April 2013. The effect is limited to just the 8.5 million children that are in families that received Social Security. In families where Social Security benefits are received on behalf of children or by parents or guardians, Social Security reduces their poverty rate from 54.2% to 27.2%. The relative effect of Social Security on the poverty status of all 73.0m children in the U.S. appears much more modest. Among families with child beneficiaries, about $3.847 billion in Social Security benefits were reported in April 2013. Of this amount, nearly half (49.2% ) went to families that had total incomes, excluding Social Security , below the poverty line. This is more than five times the estimated $4.485 billion in federal cash welfare spending under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program in FY2013. Whereas TANF may be considered "target efficient," in terms of targeting the poor, Social Security is more targeted. Social Security plays a much greater role in reducing poverty among children than does TANF. The estimates presented in this report are based on survey data and are subject to respondent misreporting. The SIPP data do not provide the comprehensive detail to precisely identify child beneficiaries. It should also be noted that estimates of the pre-transfer poverty status of children (i.e., poverty status excluding Social Security from total income) provide one measure of the relative importance of Social Security in combating child poverty. It is not possible to precisely identify the Social Security beneficiary status of children on the SIPP. The SIPP collects information on Social Security receipt and the reasons for receipt for persons age 15 and over. It collects information about whether an adult collects Social Security on behalf of children. The pre-transfer poverty estimates should not be confused with the full effects on poverty of eliminating the Social Social Security program, as some individuals would alter their behavior in absence of the program. For more information, visit www.poverty.org. under age 21. In such cases, however, it does not identify the specific children in the family for whom Social Security benefits are received. Some adults may include the child's portion of their Social Security benefit as their own, without explicitly indicating that they received Social Security on behalf of a child. In total, about 8.5 million children under age 18 were identified on the SIPP in April 2013, according to the Social Security Trusteeship Program for Individuals with Disabilities, or SIPP. as living in families in which Social Security benefits were reported, either on their own behalf, or on behalf of another family member. In April 2013, an estimated 3.148 million children under age 18 on the SIPP were identified as Social Security child beneficiaries. An additional 1.893 million children lived with a parent or guardian who reported receiving Social Security but who did not indicate that benefits were received for a child. In some cases the benefits received by these parents or guardians may contain an allowance for beneficiary children that is not separately identified.

Summary:
In fiscal year 1998, the Congress appropriated $25 billion in discretionary budget authority for the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s programs. HUD provides rental housing assistance-about $21 billion in fiscal year 1996-that enables about 4.7 million low-income households to obtain safe, decent, and affordable housing. HUD assists about two-thirds of these households through its Section 8 housing assistance program. HUD estimates that the cost of Section 8 contract renewals for the tenant-based program alone will increase from $2.5 billion in 1997 to $10.5billion in 2002.  HUD’s financial management systems did not provide summary information to determine the number of expiring Section 8 contracts. HUD could not assure the Congress that its Section 8 budget requests for fiscal years 1992 and 1993 were reasonably accurate. To help correct the deficiencies, HUD implemented a new Section 8 tenant-based information system in fiscal year 1995. The system contains the actual cost incurred by each housing agency for providing rental assistance. It also provides the amount of unspent budget authority credited to each housing agencies at the end of the agency's fiscal year. OIG: $9.9 billion of budget authority excess to program needs has accumulated in housing agencies’ reserve accounts. Congress rescinded $4.2 billion, and after other adjustments, the current balance is about $3.5 billion. HUD recaptured $7.7 billion of this excess balance and retained the difference of $2.2billion to cover contingencies and to account for future transactions. OIG provided a draft of this report to HUD for review and comment and we address HUD’s comments at the end of each applicable chapter. contingencies, far less than the amount that HUD has reserved for this purpose. During fiscal year 1996, an additional $1.4 billion in excess budget authority accrued. HUD plans to adjust its reserve level after it examines in more detail housing agencies’ actual use of available unexpended budget authority in fiscal years 1996 and 1997. HUD is not required to and does not currently report in its annual budget justifications the aggregate amount of excess unexpending budget authority credited to housing agencies' reserve accounts. In September 1997 HUD proposed changes in its contract renewal estimate that lowered the average unit cost by approximately 14 percent, from $6,386 to $5,499. This change represented a decrease of $1.123 billion in the budget authority requested by HUD for its tenant-based program. In fiscal year 1995, HUD began reducing the terms for renewed expiring contracts from 3 to 5 years to 1 year. HUD does not appear to need additional funding for tenant- based amendments beyond fiscal year 1998.  HUD’s budget operations have been fragmented and disjointed, preventing clear accountability and the necessary coordination. HUD plans to no longer extend expiring tenant-based contracts with excess budget authority within the program reserves. All program divisions are hiring a chief financial officer to mirror the operations of the Department's Office of the CFO. HUD also has implemented a risk management program to protect resources from fraud, waste, and abuse and to maintain the agency's financial integrity. efforts to correct the problems identified, HUD has no specific time frames for their completion.

Summary:
In the 1800s, the private sector played a central role in financing early transportation infrastructure development in the United States. More recently, there has been a move back towards policies that encourage more private and public blending of funding, responsibility, and control in transportation projects. Much of the federal government’s share of new capital investment in mass transportation has come through the New Starts program. We have previously identified New Starts as a model for other federal transportation programs because of its use of a rigorous and systematic evaluation process. process. If the agreed-upon cost, schedule, and risk transference are not met, the government withdraws its funding. United Kingdom Department for Transport officials told us that they have experience withdrawing funding when such conditions have not been met. We also found that other U.S. Department of Transportation modal administrations have also withdrawn funding for transit projects when they have not met the agreed conditions. We have asked Transport Canada for comment and will update this article if we receive a response from Transport Canada. The Federal Aviation Administration has granted 90 of these multiyear awards since 1988. The Federal Highway Administration grants early conditional approvals to highway project sponsors seeking Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act funds. The FAA uses Letters of Intent in its Airport Improvement Program to establish multiyear funding schedules for projects that officials said allow project sponsors to proceed with greater certainty regarding future federal funding compared to the broader program. It also helps prevent project stops and starts, officials said. It is intended to encourage greater private sector involvement in projects. private sector bidders to incorporate these funds into their financial plans without having to individually apply as otherwise required. The Federal Highway Administration has also carried out three pilot programs that have allowed projects to move more efficiently through its grant process by modifying some of its requirements. These pilot projects waived certain aspects of the federal-aid highway procurement provisions, such as moving forward with final decision prior to a National Environmental Policy Act decision, and allowed federally funded highway projects to use alternative approaches including design-build. Pilot program allowed project sponsors in two states to contract with the private sector at a much earlier point in the project development cycle than was previously allowed. FTA does not yet have an evaluation plan to accurately and reliably assess the pilot program’s results, including the effect of its efforts to streamline the New Starts process. Having helped pave the way for design-build to become the standard project delivery approach in highway projects, pilot program has been a big success for the federal government. The Federal Highway Administration has not yet granted project sponsors any major streamlining modifications. A sound evaluation plan is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of a pilot program, says FTA. Without such an evaluation plan, FTA is limited in its decision making regarding its pilot program. The plan should incorporate key features including: well-defined, clear, and measurable objectives, measures that are directly linked to the program objectives, criteria for determining pilot program performance, a way to isolate the effects of the pilot program; a data analysis plan for the evaluation design; and a detailed plan to ensure that data collection, entry and storage are reliable and error-free. Congress will be limited in its decision making about the pilot program’s potential broader application. FTA officials told us that they have not yet developed an evaluation plan for its pilot program. The alternative approaches we reviewed have protected the public interest in various ways to ensure the public receives the best price for a project and to create incentives for the private sector partner so that the project progresses and operates based on agreed-upon objectives. Project sponsors we found that the alternative approaches protect the public's interest. Interviewed have attempted in part to protect the public interest by ensuring the use of competitive procurement practices. These practices are not unique to alternative approaches and are sometimes used in conventional procurements. Federal law and regulations generally require federal contracts to be competed unless they fall under specific exceptions to full and open competition. Nevertheless, project sponsors told us that maximizing the use. of these competitive procurement Practices helps to maximize the public's interest in transit projects, the authors say. The authors say the public should be able to have a voice in how transit projects are funded. European Union countries are required to have multiple bidders for procurements. Procurements with only one bidder are less competitive and can result in less attractive bids. For example, although Bay Area Rapid Transit prequalified three contractors for the first version of its Oakland Airport Connector, two contractors withdrew during the negotiation period due to concerns about the project affordability. Bay AreaRapid Transit negotiated with the sole remaining bidder on costs for nearly a year but then let the Request for Proposals expire with no bids. Minnesota Metro Transit Hiawatha Corridor and Denver’s Transportation Expansion light rail offered proposal stipends to private sector entities that submitted formal bids. Stipends add costs that must be weighed against the benefits they provide. Project sponsors have encouraged early and sustained interaction with the private sector to test the project's marketability and whether and in what form private sector participation is advantageous. Such feedback can be helpful in the development of a project's plans and plans for the future, the authors say. be obtained through bidder information sessions and from consultants. Project sponsors then conduct a request for qualified bidders to gain more detailed input from the private sector on a project. The request can establish a higher threshold of responsibility for private partners compared to traditional procurements in which a private partner is selected based primarily on bid price. Thus, sustained and iterative interaction between the project sponsor and theprivate sector can refine the project’s scope and terms and determine how best to use the funds. include the private sector. The Canada Line project sponsor used a list of essential elements agreed upon by the public agencies funding the project. The Hiawatha Corridor project used a request for qualifications to select bidders and solicit private sector’s review of project details. Minnesota Metro Transit told us that input from the privatesector produced several good ideas that were incorporated into the project, such as a shared risk fund to provide an incentive for theprivate sector to reduce construction delays. The pilot projects are part of the Federal Transit Administration's "Transit for All" program. Project sponsors seek to protect the public interest through an emphasis on performance. Performance specifications focus on desired project performance and not design details. When specifications are focused on performance, bidders can offer a range of design and technology options as well as follow best practices that meet best practices for project delivery. For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90 or visit a local Samaritans branch, see www.samaritans.org for details. In the U.S. call the National Suicide Prevention Line on 1-800-273-8255. The East Corridor and Gold Line pilot projects initially had a 700-page design specification document for their commuter rail vehicles. After industry review and feedback that the specifications would lead to customized vehicles that would be expensive and difficult to operate and maintain, the project sponsor responded by creating a 15-page performance specifications document for the vehicles. An advisor noted that the use of design specifications is more challenging with transit projects than in highways and other sectors given the technology issues and environmental concerns. The advisor also noted that design specifications are difficult to use on transit projects due to technology issues. Project sponsors have sought to use performance standards to protect the public interest. These standards are what the private sector partner must meet to be compensated during the project. In contrast, one project sponsor noted that performance specifications should not be used when conditions of the facility or surrounding environment, for example, are unknown as unforeseen circumstances could occur that would require more specific design specifications. Also said that projects with a range of technology options must undergo the environmental review process at the highest possible level of design given the effect of different technologies on the environment. project’s construction, operations, and maintenance phases, helping to ensure adequate performance. If the private sector partner does not meet the standards, then it is penalized with no, reduced, or delayed payments. Standards for construction include delivering a completed project or project element within a set schedule. For example, the Canada Line had 400 milestones that it needed to complete and have certified in order to continue to receive timely payments during the project's construction period. Performance standards for operations and maintenance cover all aspects, also called key performance indicators. of service including the availability, frequency, and reliability of service and conditions of facilities. Some projects have also incorporated standards that link to increased ridership to provide incentives for the private sector partner to provide good customer service. For example, Nottingham Express Transit has 20 percent of its payments to the privatesector based on ridership. Additionally, the draft concession agreement for Denver’s metro area has a 20 percent ridership link to private sector payments. The London Underground chose to emphasize key performance indicators in four areas—availability, capability, ambience and service points. Regional Transportation District East Corridor and Gold Line pilot projects incorporate payment deductions. Low performance, such as delayed trains and littered or unclean railcars, persists. If low performance continues over a period, the project sponsor can terminate the concession agreement and rebid the project to another private partner. Project sponsors also protect the public interest in transit public-private partnership and other alternative approaches through the incorporation of private equity capital. When a private sector partner finances a project using equity capital, the private sector uses payments received from the project sponsors to repay. its costs plus provide a return on investment. Since the private sector partner borrows to finance its costs, it has equity at risk if it does not meet standards. Bank lenders protect their investments by ensuring that the privatesector properly develops a concession agreement and then delivers on it. This situation can create incentives for theprivate sector partner to deliver according to the terms of the agreement, the authors say. They say it can also provide incentives for project sponsors to deliver on their promises to project sponsors. The public interest is further protected by this integration of responsibilities. The bank lender and concessionaire provide additional project oversight through the monitoring of cost overruns and schedule delays, among other issues. To better protect the public interest, project sponsors have also incorporated clauses into project agreements that protect public interest. For the Croydon Tramlink, the private sector partner contributed 30 percent of project costs. In the case of the Canada Line, theprivate sector partner did not miss any of its 400 payment milestones. allow for flexibility under certain circumstances. For example, Houston Metro’s North and Southeast Corridor projects’ concession agreement incorporated this flexibility by including an operations and maintenance agreement for the first 5 years after service begins with the option for renewal. According to a consultant that works on the project, this approach was chosen in part because the project sponsor wanted to protect the public interest in the project. The project sponsor also said it was in the interest of the city to have a long-term concession agreement. Both of the London Underground’s maintenance 30-year concession agreements are reviewed for scope of work and costs by a public-private partnerships arbiter every 7.5 years. The concessionaire has the ability to request an extraordinary review by the arbiter if costs rise above a specified threshold. Periodically revisiting terms, or shorter concession periods, can also allow for changes such as system extension. One of the Docklands Light Railway extensions has breakpoints at the years 2013 and 2020 in its concession agreement. project sponsor an option to break and buy back the agreement for a set price. In contrast, in the previously mentioned example of Manchester Metrolink, concessions for phase 2 were terminated by the project sponsor to allow for system expansion in a third phase. According to consultants we interviewed, the terminations could have been avoided if the initial concessions had been shorter. Shorter concession periods are thus being used as a means to revisit terms and rebid if desired. In addition to clauses that allow project sponsors to revisit concession agreement terms, other clauses that allow for flexibility can also protect the public interest. Denver Regional Transportation District’s draft concession agreement includes clauses specifying both triggers that could lead to default and terms of compensation in case of default. Other advisors to project sponsors told us that a clause specifying the sharing of “refinancing gains” between the project sponsor and concessionaire could also help to protect public interests. These provisions help to minimize disputes, according to the advisors to the project sponsors, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Refinancing gains refer to savings that occur when the private sector revises its repayment schedule for its equity investment by taking advantage of better financial terms. The governments of the United Kingdom as well as Victoria and New South Wales, Australia, require that any refinancing gains achieved by private concessionaires generally be shared with the government. Some foreign governments have recognized the importance of protecting the public. The public interest is at the heart of the highway public-private partnerships, says the government's report. interest in public-private partnerships through the use of quantitative and qualitative public interest assessments. We have previously reported that more rigorous, up-front analysis could better secure potential benefits and protect the public interest. For example, a Value for Money analysis is a tool used to evaluate if entering into a project as a public/private partnership is in the public's best interests. The use of such tools can help lay out the expected benefits, costs, and risks of the project. Conversely, not using such tools could potentially allow aspects of thepublic interest to be overlooked. The United Kingdom, and British Columbia in Canada, among others, require a Value for Money analysis for all transportation projects over a certain cost threshold. Domestically, Florida requires avalue for money analysis for public- private partnerships, one of which was recently conducted on the Florida Turnpike. Public-private partnership is the best project delivery option available, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. The U.K. requires a Value For Money analysis if a project costs more than about $24 million, while British Columbia requires one if the cost is over $46 million. Value for Money evaluations examine total project costs and benefits. They are used to determine if a public-private partnership approach is in the public interest for a given project. Value for Money tests are often done by comparing the costs of doing a proposed project. against an estimate of the costs. of procuring that project using a public delivery model. The I-595 Corridor Roadway Improvements Project in Broward County was one of the projects assessed. The Bay Area Rapid Transit’s Oakland Airport Connector was also assessed. Value for Money analysis includes both quantitative and qualitative factors. Project sponsors can also use financial assessments such as Value for Money for other reasons. For example, they can assess if one public-private partnership option is more advantageous than another if it is decided that private participation in a project is beneficial. They can also give a range of possible project costs when coupled with a sensitivity analysis, such as for the Canada Line. The value of unquantifiable risks transferred to the private sector can also be considered. Money analysis, cautioned that the assessments are not without limitations. For example, officials and consultants told us that these analyses are inherently subjective and rely on assumptions that can introduce bias. Assessments can include the assumption that the public sector will likely have higher construction costs due to a history of cost overruns. In the United Kingdom, an “optimism bias” of 15 percent is added to a public sector comparator in part to account for this. Consultants noted that there is subjectivity in valuing risks as detailed data on the probability of particular project risks occurring are unavailable. use data from past projects and their own professional views to conduct the analysis. Some countries have further protected the public interest in transit projects that use alternative approaches by establishing quasi- governmental entities to assist project sponsors. Entities such as Partnerships UK, Partnerships Victoria, and Partnerships BC are often fee-for-service and associated with Treasury Departments on the provincial and national levels. In sum, government officials and consultants noted that Value for Money should be considered as a tool rather than the sole factor in assessing whether to do a public-private partnership. entities all develop guidance such as standardized contracts and provide technical assistance to support transit projects that use alternative approaches. According to an advisor for project sponsors, contracts for these partnerships and approaches generally follow a standard model. The United Kingdom’s standard contract outlines requirements as well as factors to consider from a project’S service commencement through termination, which is periodically updated to reflect lessons learned. For example, after the government of the United.Korea decided to build a new rail line, it decided to use an alternative approach. Kingdom required the private sector to share any refinancing gains with the project sponsor, the standard contract was subsequently updated. quasi-governmental entities provide technical assistance to support transit projects that use alternative approaches. For example, Partnerships BC provides project sponsors assistance on conducting a Value for Money assessment to determine whether private sector participation in a project is beneficial. In addition to this assistance, these entities provide other varied services to facilitate public-private partnerships across different sectors. for more information on Partnerships UK and Partnerships Victoria click here. project sponsors to help develop and close public-private partnership contracts in British Columbia. Quasi-governmental entities can further protect the public interest through the benefits they provide. According to government officials in the United Kingdom and Canada, these entities create a consistent approach to considering public- private partnerships. Further, by using standardized contracts developed by these entities, project sponsors can reduce transaction costs of implementing transit projects that use alternative approaches, they say. The project sponsors and consultants told us that they are looking forward to working with the government on the project. GAO: Without the services provided by quasi-governmental entities, project sponsors that plan to or use alternative approaches for a transit project will develop them on a case-by- case basis. While DOT has established an office to support project sponsors of highway-related public-private partnerships, DOT does not provide similar support for transit projects. FTA distributes billions of dollars of federal funding to transit agencies for the construction of new, large-scale projects; as such, it is critical that the public interest is protected and federal funding is spent responsibly. We reviewed transit project information from DOT, GAO, the Congressional Research Service, and other reports as well as interviews with DOT officials, project sponsors, industry representatives, and academic experts. We selected projects that were either completed or had already carried out substantial planning. We determined that we would focus solely on projects that have or are expected to go through the Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) New Starts process. We conducted a review of public-private literature of alternative financing and project delivery practices. reviewed pertinent federal legislation and regulations, including: Federal Register Notices and guidance for FTA’s Public-Private Partnership Pilot Program and the New Starts Program. To determine how project sponsors and DOT can protect the public interest in transit projects that use alternative approaches, we conducted site visits of selected transit public-private partnerships and visited the United Kingdom and Canada. We conducted, summarized, and analyzed in-depth interviews with project sponsors, private sector participants, international stakeholders, and experts regarding the competitive procurement process. In addition to the individual named above, Steve Cohen, Assistant Director; Jay Cherlow; Patrick Dudley; Carol Henn; Bert Japikse; Joanie Lofgren; Maureen Luna-Long; Amanda K.

Summary:
Education administers and oversees federal student aid programs authorized by HEA. Among these financial aid programs is FFELP. The five principal entities involved are students, schools, lenders, guaranty agencies, and Education. Most lenders contract with a third-party entity to service the loan and collect payments from borrowers. If the student defaults on the loan, the lender files a claim with the guaranty agency for reimbursement of most of its loss. In general, HEA designates which entities are eligible to makeFFELP loans to students. an eligible lender is defined as under certain circumstances, a national or state chartered bank, a mutual savings bank, or a savings and loan association. A pension fund as defined in the Employee Retirement Income Security is an insurance company that is subject to examination and supervision by an agency of the United States or a state. An eligible institution is also defined as the Student Loan Marketing Association or the Holding Company. A single state agency or a single nonprofit private agency designated by the state is an eligible institution. of the Student Loan Marketing Association, including any subsidiary of the Holding Company, or an agency of any state functioning as a secondary market. The majority of organizations making loans to students fall into one of these eligible lender categories. However, organizations that do not meet HEA criteria may still participate in FFELP by contracting with an eligible lender to serve as its trustee. These ineligible lenders include: a Rural Rehabilitation Corporation; under certain circumstances, any nonprofit private agency functioning in any state as asecondary market; and a consumer finance company subsidiary of a national bank. lenders fall into two categories: (1) secondary marketsthat have not been designated as an eligible lender for a state and (2) private companies that wish to make and hold student loans. Ineligible lenders generally contract with trustees for three purposes. First, ineligible lenders use trustees to allow the ineligible to originate student loans or to purchase them from another originating lender. Second, ineligibles using trustees to securitize portfolios of student loans and third, trustees are used to raise capital necessary to make or purchase student loans without securiting other loans. by selling tax-exempt bonds to investors. Report is concerned primarily with trustee arrangements used to enable ineligible lenders to make and hold student loans. At FFELP’s outset, the government expected to share the program's financial risks with state-designated guaranty agencies. When states failed to establish such agencies, the Congress enacted legislation with several incentives to increase lender and guaranty agency participation. In providing these incentives,. the Congress kept the financial risk almost entirely with the federal government. Congress has since shifted some risk back to the guaranty agencies and lenders by reducing the maximum reimbursement and insurance rates on defaulted loans. These actions were intended to encourage both lenders and guaranty agency to work with borrowers to prevent them from defaulting on their loans. Apart from the defaults that occur when borrowers fail to repay their loans, some loans lose their federal guarantee because lenders, servicers, or Guaranty agencies fail to follow the Department’s requirements for making, servicing, and collecting loans. penalties, refuse to make future payments, or recover payments already made to lenders and agencies for such things as interest subsidies and insurance claims. Loss of the federal guarantee due to servicer problems has occurred under the auspices of trustee arrangements in the past. In 1998, HEA was amended to include a provision stating that eligible lenders that act as trustees are responsible for meeting statutory and regulatory requirements for the loans they hold as trustees. For example, in the late 1980s, Bank of America served as trustee for the California Student Loan Finance Corporation. The Department of Education reports that approximately 125 trustee arrangements exist between eligible and ineligible lenders. These arrangements account for approximately $400 million in student loans. servicer problems that may result in loan guarantee loss can also occur on loans held by eligible lenders and are not unique to trustee arrangements. The Department of education reports that about 125 trustee arrangement exist between ineligible and eligible lenders. For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or see www.samaritans.org for details. The 125 arrangements represent liaisons between 16 eligible lender trustees and 31 ineligible lenders. Ineligible lenders can be further grouped as 17 secondary markets and 14 other ineligibles. Costs of trustee arrangements fall into two categories—payments to initiate the agreement and annual fees to maintain it. The ineligible lenders we interviewed reported that initiation costs were generally a flat fee ranging from $1,000 to $2,000.for $25.3 billion in outstanding loans— approximately 19 percent of the outstanding balance of all FFELP loans as of December 1999. between $2,500 and $20,000. Some secondary markets reported that their trustee charged this initiation fee each time they issued bonds to raise capital. Annual trustee fees reported by ineligible lenders ranged between $4,500 to $75,000, depending on a number of factors. These lenders reported that the fees could be a flat fee or calculated as a percentage of outstanding loan balances or on the outstanding balance of bond issues. Ineligible lenders reported the annual costs are used to pay for trustee fees. maintain the arrangement and cover the necessary services provided by the trustee. Some eligible and ineligible lenders reported that a variety of other factors could influence the size of both initiation and annual fees. Some of these factors included the structure of the trustee arrangement and the complexity of the the geographic region in which the trustee and ineligible lender operate. The trustee handles paperwork associated with the guarantors and servicers involved in the loan transactions, and carries out administrative activities associated with obtaining financing to originate or purchase loans. Some ineligible lenders feared that the provision of HEA that makes trustees fully responsible for trustee-held loans might have an impact on costs. They reported that costs did not significantly increase or decrease after the 1998 amendments were enacted and that they did not see a change in the role of the trustee. According to ineligible lenders, the trustee’s decision to charge administrative fees on a per-loan basis rather than as a flat fee, and the additional services the trustee will perform for the ineligible lender, such as payroll services, are key factors. lenders we interviewed, current initiation and annual trustee fees do not prohibit them from conducting business in the student loan market. Trustees and ineligible lenders reported similar criteria used by trustees to evaluate ineligibles before they entered into arrangements. For example, trustees reported that most important in deciding whether to enter an arrangement is the business reputation of the ineligible lender. The reputation of an ineligible lender is more important than the reputation of a trustee, according to the trustees. The trustee arrangements we reviewed shared several characteristics. the loan servicing organization it has chosen. In addition, some trustees review the structure of the financing method used by the ineligible lender to raise the capital necessary to originate or purchase loans. This review might include examining a rating agency’s report on the transaction. Trustees and ineligible lenders also reported that their contracts included similar clauses covering trustee and ineligible lender resignations. For example, they reported that trustee resignation clauses allow the trustee to resign from the arrangement by giving a specific number of days’ notice. 60 or 90 days. If ineligible lender is unable to locate another trustee within that time period, the resignation clause sometimes provides for additional time to obtain a new trustee. Most trustees and ineligible lenders reported that the trustee would probably remain in place until a new one can be engaged, even if the designated time periods have elapsed. The trustee arrangements we reviewed were also similar in the requirements placed on the ineligible lender and the amount of monitoring the trustee performed. For example, trustees generally require ineligible lenders to abide by HEA requirements. Eligible lender trustees and ineligible lenders reported limited day-to-day interaction. One trustee reported no daily interaction. Some trustees reported that they interact with the ineligible lender only when it is necessary to sign forms, such as quarterly reports that must be submitted to the Department of Education. Trustee arrangements come with some protections, but not all trustees feel they have enough protection to oversee the loan servicer, the report says. The report says the trustees perform limited monitoring activities and mostly review annual reports and audits. The most direct protection comes from an HEA provision that holds eligible lenders fully responsible for any loans they hold as trustees. For example, a loan may lose its guarantee because of servicing errors or because of negligence on the part of the servicer or the lender. When these problems occur, the federal government will not reimburse the guarantor. To ensure the government’s investment in FFELP is secure while allowing ineligible lenders to participate in the program, the HEA must be changed. or the lender for the associated dollar loss. However, because some problems may not be found until after the federal government has already provided reimbursement, the government may have to recover these monies from the parties involved. According to Education officials, the HEA provision that holds trustees responsible for an ineligible lender’s loans allows theFederal government to recoup the losses from the eligible lender trustee rather than the ineligible lender. Education officials further stated the ability to Recoup losses from a trustee is important since they believe they do not have direct oversight authority of ineligible lenders. believe the federal government is likely to recover its losses from trustees for two reasons. Most financial institutions that serve as eligible lender trustees are subject to federal oversight. Because ineligible lenders are generally not subject to financial safety and soundness reviews by government agencies, Education lacks assurance that these lenders would be able to meet their financial obligations in the program. Most ineligible lenders have merged with each other in recent years. Recent mergers include First National Bank of Chicago and Bank One, Norwest and Wellswest. with HEA. Obtaining a trustee arrangement does not appear to be a widespread problem among ineligible lenders to date. Education agreed with our recommendation that it clarify its interpretation of how the HEA provision applies to loans held by the trustee for an ineligible lender. Education did not say when it expected to implement our recommendation. We are sending copies of this report to the Honorable Richard Riley; eligible lender trustees; ineligible lenders; and other interested parties. Copies will also be made available to others on request. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please call me at (202) 512-7215.

Summary:
MRAPs are a family of vehicles with a "V"-shaped hull and armor plating designed to provide protection against mines and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) The Army and Marines first employed MRAPs in limited numbers in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2003, primarily for route clearance and explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) operations. As of July 21, 2011, 14,749 MR APs had been delivered to Afghanistan, including 6,980 M-ATVs. MRAP-All Terrain Vehicle (M-ATV) designed to better handle the rugged terrain of Afghanistan. DOD reportedly concluded a $245 million dollar contract with Oshkosh to acquire 5,100 sets of armor. Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics Ashton Carter supposedly intends to outfit all of the almost 7,000 M-ATVs in Afghanistan with these armor kits. There are concerns that additional armor might have an adverse impact on vehicle mobility, which was the prime consideration for the development of the M- ATV. Their current classified capability. While additional armor and interior improvements could improve M-atV survivability up to a point. Congress appropriated $38.346 billion for all versions of the MRAP. The full FY2011 DOD budget request of $3.4 billion was authorized by the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for FY2011 ( P.L. 111-383 ). In the President's FY2012 DOD budget proposal, there was no request for procurement funds for the MR AP program. Citing an operational requirement for 27,344 MRAPS to support CENTCOM operations, DOD requested $3,195 for theMRAP vehicle program for FY2012. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees recommended fully funding the FY2012 OCO budget request. As previously noted, many older MRAPs shipped to Afghanistan are reportedly not being used because their size and weight severely limit their effectiveness. If a large number of MRAPS are, in fact, not being use, the budget request could be in jeopardy. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended fully Funding the FY 2012 OCO Budget request. The FY2012 budget request includes $.765 billion for survivability and mobility upgrades; and $.03 billion for automotive and ballistic testing. Pentagon agreed to loan 300 MRAPs in Afghanistan for one year to 15 allied nations currently. If these vehicles are not being used, is there a better use for them elsewhere or are they to be left in country after the eventual departure of U.S. forces? Some say the vehicles were shipped to Afghanistan, as some say, for symbolic as opposed to operational reasons and, if so, what is the total cost for these unused vehicles to be shipped and maintained in theater? About 85 MRAPs are already out on loan to Poland, Romania, Georgia, and the Czech Republic. All countries that are loaned MR APs can request an extension on the loan and the borrowing countries are responsible for the costs associated with maintaining these vehicles. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) says the loans could help to reduce allied casualties and help to recoup some of the associated procurement costs of the vehicles. In August 2009 briefings to the House Armed Services Committee Air and Land Forces, and Seapower and Expeditionary Forces Subcommittees, the GAO said that the loans would help reduce casualties in Afghanistan. noted that "the introduction of MRAP, M-ATV and eventually the JLTV creates a potential risk of unplanned overlap in capabilities," a risk that needs to be managed. Defense officials have also been asked if there is a need for the MRAP/M-ATVs and JL TV programs, as these programs share as many as 250 requirements. Some analysts question the need for three distinct tactical wheeled vehicle programs, particularly in light of anticipated defense budget cuts. look for "the next best thing" in terms of tactical wheeled vehicles instead of committing to the M-ATV and JLTV programs. They could run the risk of significant redundancies and not being able to afford recapitalizing and replacing the HMMWV fleet. Substituting MRAPs whenever operationally feasible might be a more timely and cost-effective option as opposed to DOD's plans to arbitrarily uparmor approximately 7,000 M- ATVs. The use of larger and more lethal IEDs by Afghan insurgents has necessitated adding additional armor to M-atVs.

Summary:
The EU's Emissions Trading System (ETS) is a cornerstone of the EU's efforts to meet itsobligation under the Kyoto Protocol. It covers more than 11,500 energy intensive facilities acrossthe 25 EU Member countries, including oil refineries, powerplants over 20 megawatts (MW) incapacity, coke ovens, and iron and steel plants, along with cement, glass, lime, brick, ceramics, and paper installations. Covered entities emit about 45% of the European Union's carbon dioxide emissions. The figures in this column indicate the number of installations with active registry accounts on 30 April 2006. They differ from figurescommunicated in earlier press releases because they are updated for installations that opted-out for the first trading period, opted-in, andinstallations without open accounts. As all data are held in the CITL and national registries, no data are available for those Member States without an active registry. a. The figures are allowances allocated to existing installations at the start of the scheme. installations at the start of the scheme but put aside mainly for new entrants andauctioning (in the cases of Denmark, Hungary, Ireland, and Lithuania). d. Due to technical problems in the national registries of the Czech Republic, France, the Slovak Republic, and Spain, the CITL did not receivewholly reliable information on the installation level surrenders from these Member States. Some commentators have suggested that annual average 2005-2007 allocations that are actually 44.1. The Climate Action Network (CAN), a network of 365non-governmental organizations, stated the following: Emissions limits set by MemberStates for the first phase were a major disappointment. CAN: To ensure maximumenvironmental benefit of the ETS and the overall success of the system as awhole, they need to be strengthened considerably. The Kyoto targets requireambitious caps with new entrants. The EU is not on the path to the Kyoto requirements nordeveloping the trading market. This "over-allocation" does not includethe 73.4 million metric tons of allowances held in reserve by the various countries. absolute reductions for the phase 2008-2012. In general, the EC has seen the over-allocation issue as part of the"learning-by-doing" process that should help the EU in implementing the secondtrading period beginning in 2008. The new 2005 emissions data givesindependently assessed installation-level figures for the first time and so providesMember States with an excellent factual basis for deciding upon the caps in their national allocations plans. The plans are subject to approval by theCommission, which will also be making extensive use of the new data. The EU-ETS traded 362million metric tons of CO 2 in 2005, valued at 7.218 billion euro. Brokers wereresponsible for 57% of the volume, exchange markets did 15%, and bilateraltransactions accounted for 28%. Of the exchange market volume, the EuropeanClimate Exchange (ECX) had the largest share at 63%. The average price for an allowance traded in 2005 was 19.9 euro, withbrokered and exchanged allowances averaging 20.6 euro and bilateral transactionsaveraging 18.2 euro. in 2005, as indicated in Figure 1 below. Inparticular, allowance prices dropped from almost 30 euro to about 9-11 euro inApril and May, sparked by a series of reported over-allocation of allowances inseveral Member States. The EU-ETS is a maturing but still narrow market. Monthly volumes areincreasing, but have never exceeded a 1.6% monthly average. By July 2006, allowance Prices had recovered to about 17euro in July.

Modestvolume for a new system is not surprising; trading volumes under the U.S. CleanAir Act Title IV sulfur dioxide trading program were very thin in the beginning. Even after several years of operation, SO 2 allowances prices can changeunpredictably and inexplicably. Some reasons for ETS allowance price derivatives are explicable. ETS market responded to a variety of regulatory,climatic, and economic events over the first trading period. Regulatory eventsinclude the late approval of NAPs for several countries, along with the resultingover-allocation causing the sudden market correction in May. Climaticevents influencing prices include cold weather, which increased energy usage, anddry conditions, which decreased the availability of hydroelectric power. During 2005, Point Carbon analysis indicates 79% of the variance (R 2 ) inallowance prices was explained by changes in fuel prices (particularly for electricpower), with 23% ofthe variance explained by the weather. This linkage betweenallowedance prices and the power market is not a linkage between power market and CO2 prices, according to Point Carbon. surprising, as the power sectorconducted the majority of trades in 2005 and therefore significantly influencedprice development. Kaasik argues that the evidence from the past year indicates that fuelprices influence carbon prices, but not the reverse. He sees allowance prices as a derivative of natural gas and coal pricing, at least in theshort-term. Assuming natural gas-fired and coal-fired generation are the marginalcost suppliers of power, allowance prices will respond positively to increasingnatural gas prices or decreasing coal prices. electricity price byinfluencing the marginal price of electricity. The EU-ETS has provisions for linking its trading scheme to the JointImplementation (JI) and Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) components of the Kyoto Protocol. How this has evolved during the firsttrading period is illustrated by Figure 3 . Figure 3. There is a Very Long-Term Correlation Between CO2 and Electricity Price: Link Via Marginal Producer Source: Margus Kaasik, Eesti Energia, Carbon Market: EUETS (May 9, 2006) p.11. CDM. TheEC's linking directive allows operators to fulfil their allowance obligations underthe EU-ETS using credits derived from JI and CDM projects. Their credits areequivalent to allowances in environmental and economic terms, but are notinterchangeable. "Certified Emissions Reductions" (CERs) under the CDM mustbe issued by the Clean Development Mechanism Executive Board and may beused in either the first or banked for use in the second trading period. Emissions Reduction Units (ERUs) under JI are transferred from one country toanother. Several EU countries have established carbon funds topursue JI and CDM opportunities. In general, CER and ERU credits have sold at a discount to ETS allowanceprices. The degree of discount has depended on the riskiness of the project. CERand ERU Credits are available only when the projects are completed. Thus, wherebuyers take the risk, they are entered into the surrendered allowance table. The amount of CERs and ERUs that can used by an affected unit is limited by a percentagespecified by its country. of non-delivery, such as an emissions reduction purchaseagreement (ERPA), prices are in the range of 8-12 euro. In contrast, for CERsalready issued, or where the sellers take the risk, prices are  13-15euro. The real impact of CDM and JI on theEU-ETS system will not be fully known until the second trading period, when EUdemand for credits will increase substantially and other non-EU countries wouldbe implementing their own Kyoto compliance strategies. companies, governments, industryassociations, market intermediaries, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) asked which of 12 topics they felt were most important to them. Table 3 indicates thetop five topics according to governments surveyed, along with their correspondingranking by other stakeholders. The five issues are discussed below. Source: European Commission, Review of EU Emissions Trading Scheme (November 2005), p. p. 1. The European Commission's review of the ETS was published in November 2005. 13. With the over-allocation issue in the first trading period, it is likely that theEC will take a harder stance in reviewing NAPs for the second trading period. In general, the originalEU-15 countries have to reduce their emissions caps the most to meet their share of the EU's requirements under the Kyoto Protocol. Several countries facingdouble-digit percentage reductions. As indicated, EU-15 states, on average, have toreduce their emissions on an annual basis. caps 6.8% (119 million metric tons) from their current level. In contrast, as a group, the newer countries and the EU as a whole are in substantiallybetter shape. At first glance, it would appear that the EU would have little difficulty meeting its Kyoto Protocol requirements during the second trading period. However, some sectors not covered by the ETS may growfaster than sectors covered byThe ETS. Attempts to balance the burden between ETS and non-ETS sectors have already created tension in Germany. questionnaire conducted by theEuropean Environmental Agency's Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change. Most Member States would welcome harmonization of the treatment of new entrants and closures across the EU. Analogous to the U.S. acid rain program, EU states have set up reserves toprovide allowances to new entrants. In general, these allowances are provided free,as that is widely seen as helping boost new investment. Most states have yet to dip intotheir reserves for new entrants; however, the importance of the reserve will increase as the ETS enters its second, and eventually third, phase. third, trading period. Allocating allowances according to output and not differentiatingaccording to the carbon intensity of the project would provide an incentive to developlow carbon alternatives. An example provided by Grubb and Neuhoff: New entrant reserves should be basedon output or capacity, and avoid differentiating according to the CO 2 -intensity of thenew investment. In particular, giving more to coal than gas plants would be an incentive for development of low-carbon alternatives. The manner inwhich new entrants receive allowances may have a significant effect on the long-termdirection of investment -- whether it is directed toward low- carbon opportunities orused to support continuation of current economic development. rewardsinvestment in new coal facilities, which would conflict with objectives to tackleclimate change. The damaging effects would be amplified ifcarbon-intensive new entrants not only receive free allowances for the period2008-2012 but also receive promises for subsequent periods. The proposed treatment of coal-fired powerplants by the German Government shows how difficult it will be to direct future investment toward low-carbon projects. However, it could be argued that the long-term success of the ETS and theEU's commitment to Kyoto rests on such agreements. aredirection with respect to new entrants and long-term investment. Another area in which several Member States would like more harmonizationacross the EU is the definition of a combustion installation. Concernsrevolve around ambiguity in the current definition. The ETS applies to energyactivities for all sectors with combustion installations above 20 MW of thermal rated input, oil refineries, coke ovens, and, subject to size criteria, iron and steel, cement,lime, glass, ceramics, and pulp and paper facilities. Small installations (between 20MW and50MW) account for 30% (about 3,000) of the total facilities covered under the ETS. 36% of the covered installations produced less than 10,000 metrictons of CO 2 annually. Germany is attempting to have some planned coal-fired powerplants, which will be large producers ofCO 2, able to opt-out of the Ets for 14 years. The somewhat weak emissions data available at the time of the EU questionnaire suggest this is unlikely to happen. that while three-quarters of all emissionsare produced by the largest 7.5% of installations, the small installations are responsible for less than 1%. Whether the ETS shouldcontinue to cover the roughly 3,500 facilities under 10,000 metric tons annuallyremains a hotly debated issue. In choosing a gradual, incremental approach to emissions trading, the EU isrelying on other programs to control greenhouse gas emissions in other sectors, suchas transportation. The difficulties the EC may encounter in not choosing acomprehensive approach to begin with is suggested by its survey of stakeholders. in terms of increasingcoverage is toward incrementally adding more economic sectors, rather thanaddressing the more complex issue of a comprehensive system. Based on the survey,the focus is currently on the chemical, aviation, and aluminum industries. At first glance, the ETS would appear an effective vehicle for the EU to meetits Kyoto Protocol obligations during the second trading period. The anticipateddeficit between the second and third trading periods is estimated to be around $1.2 billion. The European Commission has not set a date for the full implementation of its ETS. period for the original 15 Member States can becovered by trading with the newer Member States that anticipate a surplus. Table 6 provides one series of estimates ofavailable allowances for the Kyoto Protocol's five-year compliance period.Obviously, not all these allowances may be available to the EU alone. Othercountries, such as Japan and Canada, may decide to incorporate emissions tradinginto their implementation strategies and acquire allowances from these sources. Yet,the totals suggest that all else being equal, the supply of allowances would beadequate. The availability of surplus credits created via JI and CDM is restricted by the EC linking directive. Each country is tospell out what "supplemental" means in its NAP for the second trading period.Individual countries are likely to define that term differently -- restricting allowancetrades and purchases in some countries. Another consideration is the availability of credits to be used for domestic emissions reduction efforts. The availability of Credits to be Used for Domestic Emissions Reduction Efforts is also restricted. is the overall commitment of the Kyoto Protocol. The ETS only covers a percentage of the overall greenhouse gasemissions in the various Member States of the EU. Some sectors not covered by theETS may grow faster than sectors cover by the ETS. It is too early to tell whether the Ets market signal and individualcountries' NAPs will move investment in low-carbon technologies. The transportation area is already a major source ofconcern. A final consideration for the E TS is its suitability for directing long-terminvestment toward a low- carbon future. the appropriate direction. Germany is attempting to direct its second NAP toward carbon-intensive, coal-fired electric generating facilities rather than low-carbon alternatives. Reluctance by countries to redirecttheir NAPs and an inconsistent price from the ETS make the long-term effect of theETS uncertain. Norway, a non-EU country, also has an emissions trading system that beganoperating on January 1, 2005. Norway's system covers 51 facilities in the energy andprocess sectors such as oil refining and iron and steel processing. The carbon tax is levied on about 64% of the country's CO 2 emissions. Other parts of Norway's industry, particularly its offshore oiland gas sector, are covered by a carbon tax of almost 40 euro per metrictonne of CO 2. The firstphase of the trading program covers the period 2005-2007, with a second, expandedphase to begin in 2008. The government had indicated earlier that it would consider expanding the system from 2008 to include as many sources of emissions as practical.

Summary:
Title V of the Social Security Act (SSA) authorizes funding for services and projects that are intended to improve the health of mothers and children. This report focuses on the MCH Services Block Grant, which receives the largest single appropriation under Title V. The Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) administers the grant. The grant is administered by the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program. Title V was enacted by Congress in 1935 as part of the Social Security Act (SSA, P.L. 74-271) to promote and support the health of mothers and children. Two grant programs were established to enable states to improve maternal and child health services. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 replaced the term "crippled" with the term 'children with special needs' in the original Title V of the SSA. The term 'special needs' is now used to refer to children with disabilities. Children with special health care needs (CSHCN) are defined by HRSA as "those who have or are at increased risk for a chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional condition" CSHCN includes children with disabilities who receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI, formerly §1615 [c] of the SSA); lead-based paint; and low-income women and children. Over time, additional programs targeting these children were added to the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and SSA. Title V was converted to the MCH Services Block Grant in 1981 by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) OBRA 1981 consolidated the existing categorical programs listed above into a single block grant. The consolidated block grant was intended to give the states more flexibility in determining how to use federal funds to address maternal and child health. Title V was also used to fund poisoning prevention programs, genetic disease programs, hemophilia treatment centers, adolescent pregnancy grants, and sudden infant death syndrome programs. The MCH Services Block Grant currently has three components: block grants to states, a set-aside for Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS), and another set- aside for the Community-Integrated Block Grant. It required that each state receive, at a minimum, the combined funding of the programs that were consolidated under OBRA 1981. Additional changes were made to the block grant under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989. These changes increased the authorization of appropriations, called for greater accountability, and created stricter rules. The MCH Services Block Grant was appropriated $638.2 million in funding for FY2016. The majority of this funding is distributed to the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau. Some of these funds are reserved for CISS grants, and others are devoted to research via the SPRANS grants. Title V of the Social Security Act established seven broad goals for the program. the MCH Services Block Grant. Maternal and child health services, research, training, demonstrations, and other activities funded by the block grant must be linked to one or more of these goals. The seven goals are as follows: ensure access to quality health care for mothers and children, especially those with low income or limited availability of care. reduce infant mortality; provide and ensure access. to comprehensive prenatal and postnatal care to women (especially low-income and at-risk pregnant women); increase the number of children receiving health assessments and follow-up diagnostic and treatment services. Primary use of MCH Services Block Grant is to fill gaps in core public health services. States are required to use at least 30% of their block grant allocations for preventive and primary care services for children. MCH workforce development, genetic services, and diagnostic and treatment services for hemophilia are funded by SPRANS. CISS grants fund projects that support integrated maternal and child health services at the community level. The law provides that block grant funds are to be used by the states "to provide and to assure mothers and children (in particular those with low income or with limited availability of health services" Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant provides funding for core public health services provided by maternal and child health agencies. Services funded by the block grant may include prenatal care, well-child care, dental care, immunization, family planning, and vision and hearing screening services. Block grant funding is also used to support school-based health centers. Distribution of funds depends on the needs of the states' populations, and the gaps left by other health and social service programs that are identified by the states. V agency contracts with health providers to provide the services. Agency administering the state's Medicaid program assumes the responsibility for reimbursement of those services. States may also include coordination with other services, such as WIC, under the agreement. HRSA's 2008 analysis recommended specific components for interagency agreements and provided a model interagency agreement. Adoption of a model agreement could build upon the Title V effort to ensure coordination among the block grant, Medicaid, and other programs. The SPRANS program is a HRSA- administered discretionary grant program for research and training for maternal and child health and children.  SPRANS projects must support national needs and priorities or emerging issues. They must also demonstrate ways to improve state systems of care for mothers and children. Approximately 15% of MCH Services Block Grant funds are set aside for SPRANS programs. The FY2016 budget included appropriations language that provided appropriations language for the SPRANS program. The program is funded by the MCH services block grant program. It provides funding for programs that train health care and maternal and child health personnel. It also provides funds for research into maternal and children's health. SPRANS set-aside funds for oral health ($5.00 million); epilepsy ($3.64 million); sickle cell ($2.96 million); and fetal alcohol syndrome ($0.48 million) SPRANS may also be used for genetic disease testing, counseling, and information development and dissemination programs. Preference is given to applicants who demonstrate that activities in these categories will be carried out in areas with a high infant mortality rate. Generally, the priority for funding SPRANS projects is determined by HRSA. has sometimes provided specific directives for certain programs, including set-asides for the programs listed above. In FY2016, these congressional directives comprised about 16% of SPRANS funding. In addition, the Family-to-Family Health Information Centers program funds family-staffed and family-run centers. The F2F HICs provide information, education, technical assistance, and peer support to families of children with special health care needs. They also assist in ensuring that families and health professionals are partners in decisionmaking at all levels of care. CISS grants and contracts support development and expansion of integrated services at the community level. Public or private organizations or institutions are eligible for these grants. Strategies used include maternal and infant health home visiting; projects to increase participation of obstetricians and pediatricians in Title V and Medicaid; integrated maternal and child health service. CISS is a HRSA-administered discretionary grant program that funds projects which seek to increase service delivery capacity at the local level and to promote community-based health systems. MCH Services Block Grant funds are distributed by formula to states and territories. States must contribute $3 for every $4 of federal funds awarded. States are required to maintain at least the state's FY1989 level of funding for maternal and child health programs. The program also receives 15% of funds remaining above $600 million after CISS funds are set aside. The CISS program is initiated whenever the MCH Services block grant appropriation exceeds $600million. The SPRANS program has additional funding of $5 million to develop Family to Family Information Centers. Grant program is currently authorized to receive $850 million annually. The final appropriation for FY2016 was $638.2 million. Full-year appropriations for FY2017 have yet to be enacted. Figure 2 shows historical and current funding in total and for the three components of the MCH Services Block Grant. The President's budget requested $637.6 million for the program for FY 2017. The program is discretionary and subject to the annual appropriations process. It is funded by a combination of block grants to states and SPRANS. MCH Services Block Grant funding was $638.2 million in FY2016. Funding for the program peaked at $731.3 million inFY2002. decreased federal funding for the block grant may be temporarily offset by funding for new Title V programs authorized in the ACA. The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program is funded through FY 2016. While this program is not intended as a flexible source of funds, the home visiting program has maternal and infant programs. Child health objectives that are consistent with those of the MCH Services Block Grant. Funding for MCH services is not determined solely by federal funding. States are required to provide $3 for every $4 of federal block grant funding. Other local, state, or federal funds may be used to support MCH activities. Certain MCH programs generate income through insurance payments and Medicaid reimbursements. Figure 3 shows national Title V block grant partnership funding by source of funding for FY2015. The MCH Service Block Grant has several reporting mechanisms required by the federal government. HRSA must report to Congress on the activities carried out under the SPRANS and CISS programs. HRSA has developed national performance measures in coordination with states and grantees. States have also developed and reported additional state-level measures. The first national audit of the program will be performed every two years. The second audit will be carried out every three years, and the third will be every five years, unless there is a change in the program's funding source or the program is terminated. performance measures (NPMs) for MCH were instituted in 1997. In 1998, HRSA introduced the Title V Information System (TVIS) to collect and publicly report state-level Title V data. This interactive, web-based system provides public access to Title V performance measures by state. Since 2011, all states have reported annually on their progress toward achieving the targets they set for 18 National Performance Measures. That will end with the FY2015 annual report (see Table E -1 ). Changing trends in MCH risk factors, outcomes, health services, data sources, and advances in scientific knowledge, in conjunction with budgetary constraints led the The new performance measurement system has three tiers: NPMs, national outcome measures (NOMs), and evidence-based/informed strategy measures (ESMs) Beginning with the annual report for FY2016, each state Title V program selects 8 out of 15 N PMs for programmatic focus during the five-year reporting cycle. A comprehensive list of national performance measures is provided in Appendix E . In addition to state-reported measures, the Maternal and Child Health Bureau administers two surveys, the National Survey of Children's Health and the National survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs. and submit an annual report to the Secretary on all Title V activities. States must provide a list of activities and recipients of Title V funding, along with a description of progress toward meeting national and state health objectives. The reports must be presented in a standardized format. While the measures are designed to standardize reporting across the states, they are not intended to replace state-by-state reporting. The measures are intended to provide a framework for state-to-state comparisons. They are not meant to replace individual state- to state reporting. There is still variation among states in terms of capacity for collecting and reporting data. Priority needs that were frequently identified in states' FY2013 MCH Services Block Grant applications include family support services, oral health services and childhood obesity treatment and prevention. The statute requires states to provide the number of individuals served, either in the state or in the U.S. as a percentage of the total population. The state may annually adjust the strategic plans as their priorities change. The federal government provides funding for MCH services in the form of grants to states. person or by phone, by the Title V block grant. States are also required to report expenditures by the four broad categories of service (direct health care services, enabling services, population-based services, and infrastructure-building services) Maternal and child health measures provide information on the overall health of mothers and children in each state. The numbers provided by states may be estimates if the actual numbers are not available. These measures include data on maternal mortality rates, infant mortality rates and other health statistics. HRSA differentiates between health "performance" measures and health "outcome" measures. The performance measures include data on breastfeeding, oral health care, the suicide rate, and the teenage birth rate. Outcome measures include the infant mortality rate, the ratio of the black infant mortality rates to the white infant mortality Rate, and child death rate. States are required to report data on these maternal and child health indicators by county, race, and ethnicity. Title V programs serve women and children who are covered by private and public insurance, as well as those who have no insurance coverage. Title V funding is only one component affecting these measures. Other federal and state programs and policies, including Medicaid, and WIC, as well as complex societal issues, also substantially affect the health and well-being of low-income children and their families. Access to quality health care for mothers and children is measured by several questions in the National Survey of Children's Health. Participants were asked whether they have public, private, or no insurance coverage. Participating families were also asked if their children had any health insurance. children had at least one preventive care visit in the prior year, whether they had unmet health care needs, and whether or not they had a medical home. According to the 2011-2012 National Survey of Children's Health, almost 95% of all children have health insurance coverage. The proportion of children with health insurance Coverage varies considerably by race, ethnicity, and poverty status. For example, 81% of children living in households at or below the federal poverty level have health Insurance, compared with 99% of kids living in homes at 400% or more. 90% of Hispanic children had health insurance, compared with 96% of non-Hispanic white children and 95% ofnon-Hispanic black children. The infant mortality rate (IMR) is frequently used as a proxy indicator for the health status of children generally. The most recent data reported to HRSA by the states are shown in Figure D -1 , although current reporting years vary among the states.. CDC's National Center for Health Statistics has published the most recently available data on infant mortality rates. Of the 50 states, Mississippi had the highest IMR (9.97 per 1,000 live births) and New Hampshire had the lowest (3.95) IMR is generally higher in the South and Midwest, and lower in other regions. Risk factors for infant mortality, including higher rates of teenage births, prematurity, and inadequate prenatal care in the first trimester, disproportionately affect low-income people.single-year linked birth and death certificate information on IMR. Comparing data from both HRSA and CDC, the data show similar variability in rates by state and region. In 2012, the infant mortality rate for women enrolled in Medicaid was 10.3 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, compared with 7.7 for those not in the Medicaid program. Prenatal care is recognized as an important factor in the health and well-being offamilies.

For confidential support, call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90 or visit a local Samaritans branch or click here. Pregnant women who receive late or no prenatal care are more likely to experience complications of childbirth, including low birth weight. The rate of pregnant women entering prenatal care in the first trimester is generally higher among non-Medicaid populations than among women enrolled in Medicaid. These rates also vary by state. For example, in 2012, 92% of pregnant woman in Maine received prenatal care. However, in the same state, this rate was 90% among those enrolling in Medicaid and 97% among the general population. In Georgia in 2012, 45% of pregnant women received care in the first trimester. This rate was 41% among the Medicaid population and 52% among non-Medicaid populations. Lack of insurance coverage and lack of access to a primary care provider may be barriers. These barriers tend to be higher among racial and ethnic minorities, researchers have found. In Medicaid enrollees, limited availability of maternity care providers, limited. availability of transportation, and late enrollment in Medicaid as barriers to early prenatal care. Overall, 84% of children had one preventive health care visit in the year preceding the 2011-2012 National Survey of Children's Health. Non-Hispanic white children had the highest rate (86%) of preventive health Care visits in the preceding year, followed by non-Hispanic black children. There was slight variation among racial and ethnic groups; non- Hispanic black children had a higher rate of preventive Health Care Visits than Hispanic white children (87% vs. 85% in the previous year). children (84%), and Hispanic children had the lowest rate (81%). Children who were uninsured (54%) were less likely than those covered by public insurance (84%) to have received preventive health care in the past year. These rates also varied by age, with older children and teenagers less likely to have gotten preventive care than infants and preschool-aged children. Children with special health care needs often need health, mental, and social services beyond preventive care. They also are more likely to be uninsured. injuries that require medical care. Accessing these additional services may create additional access and financial burdens on families. Children with special health care needs may qualify for Medicaid or CHIP, and they are more likely to have health insurance. In the 2009-2010 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, access to preventive and health care services is measured by a series of questions on use of services and unmet needs. Overall, 76% of children did not have an unmet need for specific health care Services in the year prior to the survey. an unmet health care need was much higher among children with no insurance than children with insurance. Shared decisionmaking between families of children with special health care needs is another goal for the MCH Services Block Grant. Multiple components determine whether a family is receiving family-centered care. These components include the amount of time spent with health care providers, their level of attentiveness, sensitivity to families' values and customs, and the relevance of information provided to families, according to the grant's website. and whether the family felt like a partner in their child's health care. The 2009-2010 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs found that families with insurance coverage were more likely to report family-centered coordinated care than families without insurance coverage. Another approach to ensuring family- centered, community-based care is the medical home. Medical homes provide patients access to primary care medical providers and a coordinated care team. They have been associated with improved care outcomes and outcomes for children with special health needs. 47% of children with special health care needs had a medical home in 2011-2012. Access to care is often cited as a barrier to health services. State toll-free hotlines provide callers with state-specific Medicaid enrollment information. In 2012, state toll- free hotlines recorded 1.3 million calls regarding Medicaid enrollment. The Maternal and Child Health Services provides coverage for maternal and child health services in the U.S. It also provides care for the elderly and disabled. Block Grant is not a single program, but rather a combination of block grants to states and two discretionary grant programs. The issues related to the MCH Services Block Grant span the intersection of clinical health services, prevention, and public health. This combination of approaches provides flexibility to states in achieving maternal and child health goals, while allowing both Congress and HRSA to maintain a degree of control in guiding national initiatives, the report says. The report says the Block Grant provides increased access to health care, coverage for preventive services and other health care. HRSA: MCH Services Block Grant provided services to over 34 million children in FY2013. Of those children, nearly 15 million had Medicaid or CHIP coverage. Changes to public and private insurance markets under the ACA may affect the number of pregnant women and children served by the block grant. Some policymakers contend that during this time, pregnant women may not be able to get the care they need to stay healthy. The block grant provides coverage for preventive care without cost-sharing, and provisions for coverage of individuals with preexisting conditions. The MCH formula block grant and its discretionary grants are integral to assuring continuity of care. States may argue that block grant funds can and should be redirected to meet other maternal and child health goals, and not decreased. One general concern with block grants may be that federal funds are being used to address state-specific issues and are not held accountable to national concerns. Congress must decide whether block grants should continue to be used for Medicaid and CHIP coverage expansion to those who currently receive block grant-funded services.  states may be best suited to use block grant funds in situations where there is wide variability in burden and cost. Filling in the gaps left by Medicaid and CHIP is one such area, due to variable enrollment eligibility among the states. As mentioned earlier, the indicators discussed in this report are referred to as outcome measures and performance indicators by HRSA. improvement in these measures is an objective of Title II of the MCH Services Block Grant Act of 2013. The report was compiled by the HRSA, CDC, and the Department of Health and Human Services. V funding is only one component affecting these measures. Other federal and state programs and policies, including Medicaid and WIC, also affect the health and well-being of low-income children and their families. Progress toward national health objectives, such as reduction of the infant mortality rate, has shown past improvement but has stagnated in recent years. Due to the flexibility of funding, varying circumstances in states, and other societal issues, it is impossible to globally track the direct impact of maternal and child health block funding. grant funds on national health indicators such as IMR. Congress and the executive branch cannot direct states to specifically target one data point with block grant funding, but may use other approaches. Programs such as the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program and Strong Start have been promoted by policymakers as direct approaches to improving this particular health objective. Healthy Start, a national program that targets the infant mortality rate in selected communities, has been promoted as an alternative to block grant funds. has been successful in targeted communities. Some have argued that the decentralized nature of block grants makes it difficult to measure program performance and accountability. The quality of services provided under block grant funding is not currently tracked. However, the existing data required by Title V may be used to determine whether states are efficiently funding their gap areas with block grant funds. In addition to the MCH Services Block Grant, Title V contains a Health and Human Services (HHS) Block Grant. The HHS Block Grant provides funding for health and human services. Most of the provisions created under the ACA included mandatory appropriations for FY2010 through FY2014, with the exception of the Postpartum Depression program, which was authorized but has not been funded. SSA §510, Abstinence Education This program provides funding to states for abstinence education. P.L. 114-10 , the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, increased the Title V Abstinent Education block grant to $75 million per year for FY2016 and FY2017. and ethnic diversity, and other related subjects; (3) financial literacy; (4) parent-child communication; and (5) educational and career success. The ACA appropriated $75 million annually for each of the five fiscal years FY2010 through FY2014. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 extended PREP ($75 million per year) through FY2015.

The MCHB Discretionary Grant Information System (DGIS) electronically captures performance measures (see Table E-5 ), program, financial, and abstract data, and products and publications about these discretionary grants from the grantees. The data collected are used by M CHB project officers to monitor and assess grantee performance as well as assist in monitoring and evaluating MCHb's programs. The notice pertaining to changes in the DGIS was published in the Federal Register on March 15, 2016. MCHB's purpose in revising the performance measures is to better measure progress toward program goals. The overall number of performance measures has been reduced from prior DGIS data. The revised measures will more accurately capture the scope of services provided through the Title V Block Grant. It is hoped that the measures will better align with and support the Block Grant, specifically population domains and National Performance Measures, where reasonable. collection, and the average number of performance measures each grantee will be required to report is reduced. Further, the structure of the data collection has been revised to better measure the various models of programs and the services each funded program provides. This revision will allow a more accurate and detailed picture of the full scope of services provided through grant programs administered by MCHB. It is hoped that this revision will give a better picture of what is available to the public in the form of grants and loans.

Summary:
There were 143 petroleum refineries in the United States as of January 2013, with a capacity to process 17.8 million barrels of crude oil per day. Most refining capacity (almost 90 percent) is located in the Gulf Coast, West Coast, and Midwest regions. These refineries employed over 70,000 people in 2013. Refineries process crude oil into products primarily through a distillation process that separates crudeOil into products. The U.S. petroleum refining industry is one of the largest industries in the world. different fractions based on their boiling points, which can then be further processed into final products. One barrel of crude oil can be processed into varying amounts of gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and other petroleum products. Through the addition of specialized equipment, refineries can be optimized—or “upgraded” to produce greater proportions of specific types of products. For example, a coker unit upgrades the low-value residual oil from the distillation process into higher value products such as jet fuel. diesel, increasing a refinery’s ability to process heavier crude oils. U.S. refineries primarily produce gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel that are used in the transportation sector, along with heating oil and liquefied petroleum gases such as propane used in home heating. The industry consists of firms of varying sizes that, in addition to operating refineries, may also have operations in other related industry segments. The upstream segment consists of the exploration for and production of crude oil; the midstream segment, which consists of. pipelines and other infrastructure used to transport crude oil and refined products; (3) the downstream segment, which consists of the refining and marketing of petroleum products such as gasoline and heating oil; and (4) the renewable fuels segment. To varying degrees, refiners may primarily operate refineries or may be integrated, participating in various other related industry segments. HollyFrontier Corporation is an example of a merchant refiner that purchases crude oil from unaffiliated producers and sells refined products to consumers. Chevron is an example of a fully integrated company, a refiner that also produces crude oil and operates pipelines and retail fueling outlets across the United States. Crude oil, petroleum products, and renewable fuels are transported between market participants through an extensive supply infrastructure including pipelines, tanker vessels, rail, trucks, wholesale terminals, and retail outlets. In 2012, refineries received the majority of their crude oil by pipeline (over 50 percent) and by tanker vessel (37 percent), with trucks and rail generally playing a more limited role according to EIA data. Retail prices for regular gasoline averaged $3.63 per gallon in 2012, the highest annual average price when adjusted for inflation since 1976. Retail prices have declined in 2013, but are still near historic highs. Market dynamics anywhere along the supply chain can influence consumer prices, beginning with upstream crude oil production, the production of renewable fuels, and the refining of crude oil and gasoline. The refining industry was a low-return industry for much of the prior two decades, according to industry officials and experts. According to EIA data, increases in crude oil costs have been the largest component of the recent increases in gasoline prices. The refining component of prices has fluctuated over time but has not increased in a significant way since 2000. The five key environmental regulations affecting the domestic refining industry that we reviewed are concerned with various health, environmental, and other issues. Under the RFS, since 2000, since U.S. refineries have been required to comply with the EPA’s RFS. 2006, transportation fuels sold in the U.S. have been required to contain increasing amounts of renewable fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel. Congress established the RFS in light of concerns such as climate change and the nation’s dependence on imported crude oil. As shown in figure 5, the law generally required that transportation fuels contain 9 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2008, and that volumes increase in 2009. In 2009, EPA required that gasoline and diesel fuels contain at least 10 billion gallons. The Administrator of EPA is authorized to waive the RFS levels established in the act. The major source of renewable fuels has traditionally been ethanol produced from corn. The increased cultivation of corn for ethanol, its conversion into renewable fuels, and the storage and use of these fuels could affect water supplies, water officials say. The Administrator determines if implementing the requirement would severely harm the economy or environment, that there is an inadequate domestic supply, or in certain other situations, the EPA says. The RFS is set to increase by 2.4-fold through 2022 to 36 billion gallons. quality, air quality, soil quality, and biodiversity. Under the RFS’ statutory provisions, the increasing amounts of renewable fuels are to primarily come from renewable fuels other than corn ethanol. The RFS could reduce GHG emissions by 138 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, the EPA says. According to EPA, achieving the R FS’s statutory blending levels in 2022 could result in total benefits of between $13 and $26 billion, the agency says. The benefits include those related to fuel costs, energy security, health, and GHG effects. CAFE standards are administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 instituted several changes to the CAFE standards. In 2009, the administration announced a new program to increase vehicle fuel economy and reduce vehicle GHG emissions. NHTSA and EPA put the national program into place by issuing coordinated regulations covering vehicle model years 2012 to 2025.equal to taking about 27 million vehicles off the road. As shown in figure 6, fuel economy standards for cars largely remained unchanged from 1990 through 2010, but vehicle manufacturers are now expected to meet increasingly stringent standards. projected combined average fuel economy of about 50 miles per gallon by 2025. The standards are about 80 percent more efficient than required under the 2011 standards. EPA estimated that the 2011-2025 standards may save consumers and businesses $1.7 trillion, reduce oil consumption by 12 billion barrels, and reduce GHG emissions by 6 billion metric tons. On May 21, EPA is authorized to establish certain standards for new motor vehicles and fuels to address air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. 2013, EPA proposed the Tier 3 standards, and on March 3, 2014, EPA announced the final Tier 3 Standards. The standards establish more stringent vehicle emission standards and reduce the sulfur content of gasoline. EPA stated that the final rulemaking is very similar to the proposal, and that EPA made some changes—including to the sulfur provisions—based on public input. The views of stakeholders and other information on Tier 3 that we reviewed and summarize in the rest of this report relate primarily to the proposed standards. The Tier 3 standards set more stringent tailpipe emission standards for new vehicles. The standards generally require refiners to lower the sulfur content of gasoline from 30 parts per million (ppm) to 10 ppm on an annual average basis by 2017. More than 149 million Americans experience unhealthy levels of air pollution that has been linked to respiratory and cardiovascular problems and other adverse health effects. According to EPA, reducing the sulfurcontent of gasoline is one way to reduce pollution from cars and light trucks, among other things. of gasoline allows emissions control systems to work more effectively for existing and new vehicles. EPA estimated that the Tier 3 standards would reduce on-highway vehicle emissions of nitrogen oxides by 10 percent in 2018, and 25 percent in 2030. According to EPA estimates, by 2030, annual emission reductions would generate annual benefits of between $6.7 and $19 billion and prevent up to 2,000 premature deaths annually. EPA estimates that the vehicle and fuel standards would cost around $20 billion. approximately $1.5 billion in 2030, including costs for refiners to install and operate equipment to remove sulfur from gasoline. Under the Clean Air Act, EPA is authorized to take certain steps to address emissions from stationary sources, including refineries. EPA recently issued rules concerning how GHGs are to be included in certain existing permitting processes. Specifically, permitting authorities are to include GHG emission control requirements in Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Prevention of significant harm to the environment. permits and certain other permits issued to refineries and other stationary sources that trigger GHG emissions thresholds. Since 2011, construction of any new refineries has generally been subject to the use of the “best available control technology’ for GHGs emissions. The best available controlTechnology is determined for each facility based on an analysis of available technologies considering cost and other factors. For example, for refineries, this could involve the installation of heat recovery units, which are energy efficiency improvements. Current regulations do not require existing facilities to take any steps to control GHG emissions unless they undertake a major modification. Examples of major modifications at a refinery include a significant expansion of crude oil processing units, or installing new secondary processing units. California’s LCFS aims to lower GHG. emissions by reducing the level of carbon in transportation fuels. Established by the California Air. Pollution Control Board, the LCFS was established to reduce carbon in transport fuels. It was created to reduce the carbon in. transportation fuels, such as gasoline and diesel. The LCFS would change the mix of fuels and vehicles in California to reduce emissions throughout the fuel ‘life cycle’ The LCFS has been fully in effect since January 2011. To reduce emissions, carbon intensity (CI) scores are used, which are to reflect each fuel’s life cycle GHG emissions. Refiners generally are required to ensure that the overall CI score for their fuels meets the annual carbon intensity target for a given fuel. The CI score can include gasoline, diesel, and their blendstocks and substitutes.  LCFS refiners can meet CI reduction targets using a variety of low carbon fuel technologies. These include renewable fuels from waste and cellulosic materials, natural gas, electricity used in plug-in vehicles, and hydrogen used in fuel cell vehicles. The original LCFS statewide reduction targets for gasoline, diesel, and their substitutes started at 0.25 percent of 2010 values in 2011 and increased to 10 percent by 2020. However, in 2013 a state Court of Appeal found that CARB must correct certain aspects. CARB officials announced a regulatory package would be proposed in 2014. The 2013 standards will remain in effect through 2014. Refiners can produce their own low carbon fuels, buy such fuels from other producers to blend into their products and sell on the market, or purchase credits generated by others. CARB estimated that 1 percent decrease in carbon intensity from 2010 values would be needed to meet LCFS standards. The standards are based on the procedures by which the LCFS was originally adopted, CARB says. The 2020 targets would reduce GHG emissions associated with the transportation sector in California by 10 percent in 2020, or 23 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. Stakeholders identified three major changes that have likely recently affected the domestic petroleum refining industry. Crude oil production in the United States and Canada has increased, which has lowered the cost of purchasing crude oil for some refiners. After many years of generally increasing domestic consumption of petroleum products, consumption has slowed in the U.S. and Canada. has fallen since 2005, resulting in a smaller domestic market for refiners. U.S. and Canadian crude oil production has increased in recent years, leading to lower crude oil costs for some refiners, according to several stakeholders we contacted. According to EIA data, U.s. production of crude oil reached its highest level in 1970 and generally declined through 2008, reaching a level of almost one-half of its previous peak in 2008. CAFE and GHG vehicle emission standards and the RFS have likely recently contributed to declining consumption. Recent improvements in technologies have allowed companies to extract oil from shale formations that were previously considered inaccessible. In particular, the application of horizontal drilling techniques and hydraulic fracturing have increased U.S. oil production. The process injects a combination of water, sand, and chemical additives under high pressure to create and maintain fractures in underground rock formations that allow oil and natural gas to flow. The United States increasingly relied on imported crude oil to meet growing domestic energy needs during the 1990s and early 2000s.  monthly domestic crude oil production has increased by over 55 percent through September 2013 compared with average production in 2008. According to EIA, increases in production in 2012 and 2013 were the largest annual increases since the beginning of U.S. commercial crudeOil production in 1859. Much of the increase in crude oilProduction has been from shale and other formations, such as the Bakken in North Dakota and the Eagle Ford in Texas. Similarly, crude oil Production in Canada— the largest foreign supplier of crude oil to the United States has also increased significantly in recent years. The rapid growth in U.S. and Canadian crude oil production has lowered the cost of crude oil for some domestic refiners that have the access and ability to process these crude oils. For example, West Texas Intermediate crude oil was $17.60 per barrel less expensive in 2012 than Brent, an international benchmark crude oil from the European North. From 2005 through 2012, total Canadian crudeOil production increased by 32 percent and U.s. imports from Canada increased almost 50 percent. Sea that was historically about the same price as West Texas Intermediate. Those refineries able to take advantage of these lower priced crude oils have benefited because crude oil costs are the largest cost for refiners. Some of the growth in production has been in areas with limited transportation linkages to refining centers. The development of domestic and Canadian crude oil production has created some challenges for U.S. crude oil transportation infrastructure. Most refineries may not have been able totake advantage ofThese crude oils to the same extent for two key reasons. of the system of crude oil pipelines in the United States was constructed in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. The infrastructure was designed primarily to move crude oil from the South to the North. But emerging crude oil production centers in Western Canada, Texas, and North Dakota have strained the existing pipeline infrastructure. Though pipeline capacity has increased, investment increased pipeline capacity to deliver crude oil to a key Cushing, Oklahoma hub by about 815,000 barrels per day from 2010 through 2013. Some refineries may not have been able to take full advantage of crude oil production increases. Infrastructure constraints have contributed to discounted prices for some domestic crude oils. Domestic consumption of petroleum products peaked in 2005 at 20.8 million barrels per day. Consumption of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel peaked in 2007 and declined by over 8 percent through 2012. More stringent fuel economy standards and the RFS, which are discussed in the next section, have likely affected the refining industry, according to stakeholders. petroleum fuels, but the extent is unclear. These standards aim to reduce oil consumption, and although they do not require changes at the refinery level, they can affect refineries indirectly. National Academy of Sciences: It is difficult to isolate the effect of CAFE and GHG vehicle emissions standards from other factors that also affect consumption. EPA estimated in 2010 that vehicles were expected to save 1.3 billion gallons of gasoline in 2013 compared with model year 2011 standards. This is equivalent to about 1 percent of EIA’s projection of gasoline consumption in 2013. annual RFS standards, and several factors contribute to the delays. RFS Has Had Three Main Effects Stakeholders we contacted and information we reviewed identified three main ways the RFS has affected U.S. petroleum refiners. compliance has recently increased costs for some refiners, (2) required blending of renewable fuels has contributed to declining domestic consumption of petroleum-based transportation fuels, and (3) EPA’s delays in issuing annual RFS Standards may have contributed to investment uncertainty. Refiners are required to ensure U.S. transportation fuels include certain amounts of renewable fuels. They can purchase and blend renewable fuels themselves, or they can pay others to blend or use renewable fuels by purchasing credits. These credits can be freely traded, and prices for credits are established based on the market and generally reflect the stringency of requirements and the costs of incorporating additional renewable fuels into the transportation fuel system to comply with the RFS. If costs increase, credits prices would tend to increase as well. According to EIA, corn-based ethanol credit prices were low between 2006 and much of 2012. In 2013, prices for these credits increased to over $1.40 per gallon in July before declining to about $0.20 per gallon as of mid- November 2013. Several stakeholders told us this increase in credit prices was primarily due to RFS requirements exceeding the capability of the transportation fuel infrastructure to distribute and the fleet of vehicles to use renewable fuels, referred to as "renewable fuels" the “blend wall.” A refiner we spoke with also attributed the decline in credit prices in the second half of 2013 to EPA’s statements expressing its desire to address the blend wall. While the RFS applies to all refiners in the same way, the effect of the rise in credit Prices may depend on each refiner's situation. However, in comments to this report EPA stated that refiners experience the same compliance costs. As a result of higher costs, several stakeholders told us. refiners could reduce production, produce more jet fuel, which is not subject to RFS requirements, or increase exports to nations where the RFS does not apply. The RFS has contributed to the declining domestic consumption of petroleum-based transportation fuels. As a result, refiners and other industry participants have blended increasing amounts of renewable fuels. (See app. III for more information about the blend wall, RFS credits, and views on how they have affected U.S. refiners.) consumption of ethanol has increased almost 8-fold since 2000. According to EIA, increased ethanol use since 2007 displaced over 4 billion gallons of petroleum-based gasoline. As discussed previously, decreases in consumption affect refiners by decreasing the size of the domestic market. Since the RFS was established in light of concerns about the nation’s dependence on imported crude oil, decreased consumption of petroleum products may further some of the objectives of the R FS. The RFS has contributed to investment in ethanol production. EPA has not issued annual RFS standards on time since 2009. Most recently, EPA issued 2013 standards in August 2013, over 8 months late. EPA proposed the 2014 standards on November 2013, and has not yet issued the 2014 Standards. EPA is required to set annual blending percentages for total renewable fuels, advanced biofuels, cellulosic biofuELs, and biomass-based diesel fuels by November 30 of the preceding calendar year. However, as shown in figure 9, EPA has missed the statutory deadline. The RFS compliance period is set by statute to be a full calendar year, and delays do not change this compliance period. When the RFS standards are issued late, the industry has less time to plan and budget effectively. Several representatives of refiners told us that delays in issuing annual RFS Standards increase uncertainty for refiners. EPA officials told us they plan to finalize the standards in Spring 2014, and they expect them to be in compliance by the end of the year. The deadline for the standards is Nov. 29, 2013. EPA officials say there is no indication that delays have caused significant problems for refiners. Delays could actually make annual standards more robust since EPA then has more data upon which to base decisions. One refining company representative told us that the company has reduced capital investments due to uncertainty related to the RFS. The delays in issuing RFS standards have largely been due to Regulatory Development Processes, EPA officials say. The RFS is the nation's primary source of renewable fuel for power plants, vehicles and vehicles. to the length of the regulatory development process, which includes interagency and public reviews. The interagency review process is to ensure that regulations are consistent with the President’s priorities, among other things, and that decisions made by one agency do not conflict with the policies or policies of the other agencies. EPA is to follow certain procedures before publishing proposed or final regulations that establish annual RFS standards, including submitting draft proposed and final regulations to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Under the public review process, EPA must publish a proposed standard in the Federal Register. According to EPA officials, the interagency and public review processes can be time consuming. The RFS standards involve complex and controversial issues and balance competing agricultural, energy, and environmental policy interests. In 2009, we recommended that EPA and other agencies track their performance for developing significant regulations against targeted milestones to identify opportunities for improvement. We found that the agency's performance against this recommendation was below average. The agency's overall performance against the 2009 recommendation was also below average, we found. EPA tracks 14 milestones as it develops proposed rules and additional milestones in developing final regulations. For example, EPA tracks when its senior management approves of a document describing the scope of the regulation and the analytical work necessary to develop it. In comments to our 2009 report, EPA said monitoring actual versus estimated performance could help agency managers identify steps in the process that account for substantial time and provide information necessary to evaluate whether time was well spent. In this regard, EPA says it uses an agency-wide Action Development Process. to our 2009 report, EPA stated that it used an internal tracking system along with additional information to develop regulatory management reports to EPA managers and executives. EPA officials told us that they develop RFS regulations using the same procedures used for developing all EPA regulations. However, even with these systems, EPA has not met its statutory deadlines under the RFS in the five annual standards since 2009. EPA has also not conducted a systematic review of RFS rules to ensure that they are being implemented on time. review of its experience issuing RFS regulations to identify the underlying causes of repeated delays. EPA has not identified changes in its approach that may help to avoid these delays in the future. The other key regulations that we reviewed have had minimal effects to date because these regulations either have not yet been implemented (Tier 3 standards) or, with respect to the other two, have not affected industry operations or costs in a major way. Without such analyses and a plan to address the underlying cause of the delays, EPA risks repeating them. way, according to stakeholders and information we reviewed. Tier 3 standards were proposed on May 21, 2013, and EPA announced final standards on March 3, 2014. Stationary source GHG requirements have been burdensome to refiners, but several other stakeholders said they have not had a major effect. EPA officials told us they were aware of only three refineries that have received majorSource GHG permits since the GHG permitting program began in 2010. The EPA says it has no immediate plans to change its GHG standards.  stationary source GHG requirements do not apply unless an existing refining facility proposes a major modification or a new refinery is proposed for construction. A refining company representative expressed concerns to us about the lengthy permitting process to authorize GHG emission increases. An EPA official said that, in most cases, best available control technologies selected to comply with GHG requirement for refining facilities involve energy efficiency improvement measures that could help refiners reduce fuel consumption and save money. In some cases, delays can occur when the refinery applicant has not yet been approved. not provided EPA with the proper information to proceed with processing the permit. The Clean Air Act requires that EPA approve or deny such permits within 12 months of receiving a complete application. LCFS is the subject of several ongoing lawsuits, which resulted in a 4-month delay in some regulatory activities and uncertainty about the status of the regulation. According to a study conducted by a consultant on behalf of industry, the ongoing legal challenge has increased fuel prices by about $0.01 per gallon to date. to LCFS is creating uncertainty that discourages new investments by industry. A refining industry trade association representative told us many refiners that previously invested in new components for their California facilities to process heavy crude oils may not be able to make an adequate return on investment. LCFS does not specifically prohibit any crude oil from being processed in California refineries, but rather it ensures that the LCFS’ goal to reduce carbon intensity in transportation fuels is not affected by increased use of higher carbon intensity crude oils. Domestic petroleum product consumption declined by 11 percent from 2005 through 2012. EIA projects that inputs to refineries in 2020 would be about 1 million barrels per day higher in scenarios with higher domestic consumption. CAFE and GHG vehicle emission standards will require more efficient vehicles in the future, which may reduce future consumption of fuels. EPA estimated that the model year 2012-2025 standards are projected to reduce U.S. consumption of crude oil by 2.2 million barrels a day by 2025. of the U.S. refining industry will also depend on the extent to which some key regulations—RFS, Tier 3, stationary source GHG requirements, and LCFS—increase costs for refiners. Increasing costs may be absorbed by refiners themselves (i.e., by reducing their profits), be passed on to consumers through higher product prices, or both. The uncertainty surrounding these regulations can affect the market climate within which refiners and other market participants make investment decisions. Such uncertainty can discourage investments in the industry overall. EPA entered a settlement in which the agency agreed to develop national performance standards. EPA has no current schedule to issue these standards, but it committed in its settlement to issue them. Several stakeholders expressed concern that future standards could impose more strict controls involving higher costs at refineries. A stakeholder told us that until EPA clarifies its approach for NSPS, many refiners will be reluctant to make certain investments in their refineries out of fear of higher costs. The settlement is expected to be finalized by the end of the year. California refiners could face higher costs or compliance challenges unless CARB adjusts future low carbon fuel requirements. Industry study estimated that the LCFS could cost the refining industry an average of $0.70 per gallon by 2020. Study also projected that 5 to 7 of 14 California refineries could cease production by 2020, and theLCFS could raise other compliance challenges because of insufficient supplies or consumer uptake of cellulosic, Brazilian sugar- cane ethanol, and other low carbon intensity fuels or vehicle technologies. CARB could introduce cost containment provisions to increase the availability of credits. Future domestic refinery production levels may depend on exports of petroleum products. U.S. recently exported more petroleum products than other leading exporters, including Russia, India, and Singapore. Exports of petroleum product represented 7 percent of refinery production in 2007 but increased to 17 percent in 2012. To sell products abroad, refiners need to be competitive with foreign refiners. The extent to which domestic refiners are able to export their products will depend on the competitiveness of domesticRefiners compared with foreign Refiners. Stakeholders and information we reviewed suggest that various factors may affect the U.S. refining industry’s future competitiveness. IEA data indicate that competition from foreign refiners may increase as global refining capacity is projected to exceed global consumption. Costs associated with environmental regulations, exports to nations with stringent fuel standards, and increasing domestic and Canadian crude oil production are also factors. To be competitive, refiners must be able to supply fuels that foreign purchasers want to buy at prices that are attractive. assumes more domestic crude oil and natural gas resources projects higher export levels. Several stakeholders told us that various issues could mitigate U.S. refiners’ ability to take advantage of growing crude oil supplies. It is unclear whether planned expansions in pipelines and rail transportation will keep pace with growing production, and these infrastructure expansions could be affected by regulatory actions to address pipeline and rail safety. Potential future increases in crude oil exports, which are currently minimal, could put pressure on refiners, stakeholders said. The domestic petroleum refining industry has been and is expected to continue to be affected by several profound changes. Some of these changes, such as the growth in crude oil production in the United States and Canada, are reshaping the industry and creating new business opportunities. To take advantage of some of these opportunities, refiners and other market participants will need to invest—to upgrade refineries to be able to process different crude oils or to build pipelines or rail connections to move more crude oil from production to refineries. EPA has missed the annual deadline for issuing annual standards under the RFS in most years. EPA may waive the statutory volumes in whole or in part according to statutory criteria. Uncertainty can affect the market climate within which these investment decisions will be made. EPA’s timeliness in issuing annual percentage standards under RFS is important to help inform the investment decisions of the refining industry. The EPA has some systems in place to help the industry prepare for the new regulations. EPA has identified as potentially factoring in the blend wall, market developments, and other issues. to monitor and evaluate progress in developing regulations, which could provide useful information for understanding delays in RFS. But EPA has not identified the underlying causes of delays, and it has not developed a plan to address delays and, therefore, risks repeating delays. Uncertainty among refiners, renewable fuel producers, and other market participants about how EPA will address the blend wall, which can be exacerbated by the prospect of litigation, can affect investment. EPA delays in issuing RFS standards are important because delays do not change refiners’ compliance periods accordingly. investment decisions and ultimately the availability and prices of the fuels they produce. We recommend that the Administrator of the EPA take the following two actions: Assess past experience to identify the underlying causes of delays in issuing annual RFS standards. Develop and implement a plan to address the causes of delay and help ensure RFS annual standards are issued on time. We provided drafts of this report to DOE, DOT, and EPA for review and comment. The three agencies provided technical comments on early drafts of the report. EPA generally agreed with our findings and recommendations and clarified three topics discussed in the report. EPA asserted that refiners experience the same compliance costs regardless of whether they are fully integrated, with blending capabilities, or merchant refiners that purchase credits for compliance. For example, in a 2011 study, DOE identified the degree to which a small refiner can actively blend production with production. Based on our work, we found the views of several stakeholders differed from EPA's. We incorporated these views into our final drafts. renewable fuels is a large component that could contribute to economic hardship from compliance with the RFS. In theory, market-based compliance systems provide incentives for market participants to make decisions that would tend to equalize additional compliance costs over time. There can be physical infrastructure or contractual constraints, among various other factors, that could result in different outcomes in the short run. We added additional language to explain EPA's views in the report and in Appendix III. Second, regarding the time-frame for RFS compliance, EPA stated that the R FS compliance deadline is the date by which refiners must comply. and other obligated parties must demonstrate compliance to EPA—is established through implementing regulations, not statute. EPA stated that it adjusted the 2013 deadline to provide additional time to demonstrate compliance. The compliance period refers to the time during which refiners and other parties incur obligations under RFS and can take steps to incorporate additional renewable fuels to generate credits for compliance. This period is set by statute to be a full calendar year. We clarified language in the report to acknowledge EPA's ability to adjust the compliance deadline. additional time for obligated parties to purchase credits, and its inability to adjust the compliance period. Third, regarding Tier 3 standards, EPA announced the final standards while our draft was with the agency for comment. EPA stated that the final Tier 3 program is very similar to what it proposed, though EPA made some changes based on public input and updated its analyses. EPA provided technical comments to incorporate information from the final rule which we incorporated into the report, as appropriate. However, we were not able to obtain stakeholder and other views on the finalTier 3 rule for the report. GAO will send copies to the appropriate congressional committees and to the Secretaries of Energy and Transportation and the Administrator of the EPA. The report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff members have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-3841 or ruscof@gao,gov. See appendix IV for EPA’s letter to theGAO. This report provides information on the domestic petroleum refining industry and its market and regulatory environment. It addresses what is known about (1) major changes and (2) major factors that may affect the future of the domestic refining industry. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix V.our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. To provide information on major changes that have recently affected the domestic Petroleum refining industry, this report includes information on key environmental regulations. affected the domestic petroleum refining industry and the future of the industry. We reviewed information including: studies by federal agencies and consultants, company financial regulatory filings, and proposed and final regulations and regulatory impact analyses. Based on our research and information from stakeholders, we identified five key regulations that were recently strengthened or proposed: the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Renewable Fuels Standard. We also asked agency officials and other stakeholders we contacted to recommend studies that could be used in the study. regulations, (2) the Department of Transportation’s Corporate Average Fuel Economy and EPA's greenhouse gas vehicle emission standards. We reviewed agency regulatory impact assessments and industry and other studies on the effect of these regulations on industry. We also summarized the results of semistructured interviews with a nonprobability sample of 32 stakeholders. (See app. II for a list of these stakeholders.) Stakeholders included representatives from refining companies, oil refineries, and other industry groups. environmental organizations, consultants, and officials from federal and state agencies. We also visited several refineries of selected refining companies. We selected these stakeholders to represent broad and differing perspectives on these issues. For example, to select refiners, we considered, among other factors, the size and location of their refineries, and whether they were vertically integrated or merchant refiners. When possible, we used a standard set of questions in interviewing stakeholders, including questions about the effect of the key regulations we reviewed. on additional questions tailored to these stakeholders’ expertise and sought opinions from stakeholders on key issues. Because we used a nonprobability sample, the views of these stakeholders are not generalizable to all potential stakeholders. Similarly, the conditions at the refineries we visited are notgeneralized to all refineries. The stakeholder views we summarize were not necessarily supported by all types of stakeholders, though we identify differing views where appropriate. Stakeholders and information we reviewed identified a number of issues that need to be addressed. changes that have affected the industry and a number of factors that may affect its future. To illustrate major changes over time and to describe the domestic petroleum refining industry, we summarized historical data from the Energy Information Administration. To assess the reliability of EIA data, we took several steps including reviewing documentation, interviewing EIA staff, and consulting with stakeholders. We determined the EIAData to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. The U.S. refining industry is one of the largest in the world. We reviewed forecasts from EIA, the International Energy Agency (IEA), and IHS. We selected these forecasts because they made projections through 2020. While forecasts are subject to inherent uncertainties, we found these forecasts to be reasonable for describing a range of views about potential conditions of the domestic refining industry. We identified some differences in the metrics reported in the four forecasts and did not make direct comparisons in these instances. We conducted this review and compiled data from relevant scenarios and compared them where appropriate. performance audit from November 2012 to March 2014 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. To demonstrate compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) annual blending requirements under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), refiners use renewable identification numbers (RINs), which we refer to in this report as credits. We plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence. RIN is a unique 38-character code that renewable fuel producers and importers assign to each gallon of renewable fuel produced or imported. To demonstrate compliance with the RFS, refiners must provide sufficient RINs for the volume of gasoline and diesel they produce for use in the contiguous United States and Hawaii. For example, to comply with the 2013 total renewable fuels standard, a refiner selling 100 million gallons of gasoline would have to provide 9.74 million total Rins to EPA. RINs are valid for the calendar year in which they were generated. Up to 20 percent of a year’s standard can be met with RINs from the previous year. Refiners and other obligated parties can hold them for use in the following year or sell them to another party that needs additional Rins to comply with the blending standard. Prices for RINS reflect the cost of blending renewable fuels with natural gas, biodiesel, and other renewable fuels. For more information, go to www.renewablefuel.gov. RIN prices for corn-based ethanol increased to over $1.40 per gallon in July 2013. Several stakeholders told us this increase in RIN prices was primarily due to RFS requirements exceeding the capability of the RFS.of renewable fuels compared with the petroleum fuels they displace, the stringency of annual blending percentage standards, and other factors, and have varied over time. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), between 2006 and much of 2012, corn- based ethanol Rin prices were low. High corn prices, which made ethanol more expensive relative to gasoline, also contributed to higher RIN prices during this period. EPA officials recently said the blend wall would be reached in 2014 when about 13.2 billion gallons of E10 could be consumed. Blending additional renewable fuels can be difficult and costly once the blending wall is reached. The EPA has said it wants to address the "blend wall" by the end of the year, but no date has been set for when this will happen.  compliance has been most difficult for refiners with less of a retail presence. Some industry participants may be relatively advantaged when the price of RINs rises. EPA officials told us that the RFS program affects all refiners equally because obligations are the same regardless of whether refiners blend their renewable fuels.to deliver those fuels. For example, an ExxonMobil official said that RIN costs did not have a significant impact on the company’s financial performance during the second quarter of 2013. renewable fuels themselves or purchase RINs. In particular, EPA stated that refiners experience the same costs. If a company generates its own Rins, there is a cost associated with doing so, namely the cost for the renewable fuel compared to the petroleum fuel it displaces. GAO-12-732.

Summary:
ROTC is the largest of the three major officer commissioning programs for DOD. ROTC programs prepare college and university students to serve as officers in the military services. Most states have a unit from each service located within the state and all states have at least one unit. The Army met at least 95 percent of its overall production goals for newly commissioned officers in fiscal years 2008 through 2012. In fiscal year 2012, the Army produced nearly half of all the newly commissioned active duty officers from three major commissioning sources. The Army and the Air Force each exceeded their production goals for 3 of the 5 years we studied. Neither OSD nor the services have established performance measures that provide a comprehensive understanding of the overall effectiveness and efficiency of ROTC programs. The absence of clearly defined measures also affects the objectivity of DOD’s unit closure factors because it requires the services to determine how they should be applied. We reviewed the methodologies used by each service to identify potential units for closure and found that in addition to the five factors considered, two of the services incorporated additional factors into the process. The military services’ ROTC programs have conducted a total of 11 evaluations. The evaluations have largely occurred on an ad hoc basis, the authors say. They say the evaluations are not routine and systematic and have not yielded closures that service officials believe are needed. The authors say the services need to establish a systematic process to routinely evaluate the performance of their ROTc programs using comprehensive performance measures. The results of recent evaluations may be incomplete to draw conclusions about unit performance, they say. internally generated oversight reports. The military services have had difficulty gaining buy-in for recommendations to close dozens of underproductive ROTC units across the services. DOD and service-level guidance provide performance measures that do not provide a comprehensive understanding of the overall cost-effectiveness and efficiency of RotC programs. The services have been unsuccessful in completing any of these politically sensitive consolidations or closures in part because and prior the services do not proactively and periodically engage congressional stakeholders on RotsC program performance. GAO obtained and analyzed ROTC unit production data from each of the military services for fiscal years 2008 through 2012. For our other five recommendations, DOD concurred with each of them and estimated actions would be completed by July 2015. We encourage DOD to begin taking actions now to facilitate implementation of these recommendations as soon as possible.

==================== [64/100] ====================
Summary:
We reported in 2008 that DB plan investments in hedge funds and private equity have grown, but such investments are generally a small portion of plan assets. This remains the case today. According to a Pensions & Investments survey, the percentage of large plans (as measured by total plan assets) investing in hedge Funds grew from 11 percent in 2001 to 60 percent in 2010. The average allocation to hedge funds among plans with such investments was a little over 5 percent. Among plans with investments in private equity, the average allocation was alittle over 9 percent. survey by Greenwich Associates found that 22 percent of midsize plans were invested in hedge funds. Survey data on plans with less than $200 million in assets are unavailable. One of the major challenges that both hedge fund and private equity investments pose to plan sponsors is uncertainty over the current market. The extent to which these smaller plans invest in hedge Funds and private Equity is unclear. The impact of hedge funds on the U.S. economy is not yet known, but is expected to be significant. value of the sponsors’ investment. With regard to hedge funds, plan officials may lack information on both the nature of the specific underlying holdings of the hedge fund. Because many hedge funds may own thinly traded securities and derivatives whose valuation can be complex and subjective, a plan official may not be able to obtain timely information on the value of assets owned by a Hedge fund. Further, hedge fund managers may decline to disclose information on asset holdings and the net value of individual assets. The plan is expected to be implemented by the end of the year. largely because the release of such information could compromise their trading strategy. In addition, even if hedge fund managers were to provide detailed positions, these managers may seek to profit through complex and simultaneous positions. Although we noted in January 2008 that some hedge funds have improved disclosure and transparency about their operations because of the demands of institutional investors, several hedge funds still refuse to provide such information. It is difficult for plans to independently ascertain the value or fully assess the degree of investment risk, the authors say. pension plans cited limited transparency as a prime reason they had chosen not to invest in hedge funds. As with hedge funds, valuations of private equity investments are uncertain during the investment’s long duration, which often lasts 10 years or more. Unlike investments that are traded and priced in public markets, plan officials have limited information on the value of private Equity investments until the underlying holdings are sold. In some cases, private equity funds estimate the value. of the fund by comparing thevalue of companies in their portfolio with the. value of comparable publicly traded assets. Hedge fund and private equity investments pose investment challenges beyond those posed by traditional investments. Pension plan officials cited attaining returns superior to those attained in the stock market as a reason for investing in hedge funds. Hedge funds and private Equity funds can also feature relatively costly fee structures compared with those of mutual funds. The returns for such concentrated, undiversified funds are highly susceptible to the success or failure of each underlying company and related market sector conditions, the authors say. They say plan sponsors emphasize defining a clear purpose and strategy for hedge fund investments. Plan sponsors and others cited the importance of negotiating key terms of investments in hedge funds and private equity. Due diligence and ongoing monitoring, beyond those required for traditional investments, are also important. Investing in a fund of funds provides investors with diversification across multiple funds, which can mitigate the effect of one manager’s poor performance. But investing in a funds of funds has some drawbacks and limitations, including an additional layer of fees, such as a 1 percent flat fee and a performance fee of 5 to 10 percent. the fund selection process. The Department of Labor (Labor) can play a role in helping to ensure that plans fulfill their Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) fiduciary duties when investing in hedge funds and private equity. For example, in 2006, the ERISA Advisory Council recommended that Labor publish guidance about the unique features of hedge funds. In 2008, theERISA advisory council recommended thatLabor publish guidance to clarify the role of private equity in a pension plan's investment strategy. of ERISA fiduciaries in selecting, valuing, and accounting for hard-to-value assets, of which many hedge funds and private equity funds are composed. The Investor’s Committee published a report in January 2009 on the best practices for hedge fund investors. The report acknowledged that hedge fund investments are not necessarily suitable for some investors and provided many recommendations for investors selecting and monitoring their Hedge Fund investments. It also recommended obtaining a written statement of the fund's valuation policies and procedures. being valued in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) In 2008, we recommended that Labor provide guidance for qualified plans under ERISA on the unique challenges of investing in hedge funds and private equity. For example, we stated that Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) could outline the implications of a hedge fund's or fund of funds’ limited transparency on the fiduciary duty of prudent oversight. EBSA can also reflect on the implications for some plans—especially smaller plans—that might not have the resources to take these steps. actions consistent with the best practices, and thus would be at risk of making imprudent investments in hedge funds. While EBSA is not tasked with offering guidance to public sector plans, such plans may nonetheless benefit from such guidance. Labor generally agreed with our recommendation, but said the lack of uniformity among these investments could complicate the development of comprehensive guidance for plan fiduciaries. To date, Labor has not acted on this recommendation. As plan sponsors seek to better ensure adequate return on assets under management, recent trends suggest that investments in alternative funds could be a good idea. assets such as hedge funds and private equity are becoming more commonplace. In light of these trends and ongoing public equity market volatility, it is reasonable to expect that the number of plan sponsors making such investments will increase in the future. Such assets may serve useful purposes in a well-thought- out investment program, offering plan sponsors advantages that may not be as readily available from more traditional investment options. But investments in such assets place demands on plan sponsors that are significantly beyond the demands of more traditional asset. The Secretary of Labor should provide guidance on investing in hedge funds and private equity for qualified plans under ERISA. We believe that a discussion of the challenges that such investments pose to small plan sponsors would be beneficial. I would be happy to answer any questions that the council may have.

Summary:
BCBP has a number of initiatives underway aimed at improving its ability to identify potentially risky cargo for inspection. These efforts pose a range of challenges, from the availability of threat assessments and actionable intelligence to the capability of nonintrusive inspection technology to detect potentially harmful contraband. Separating high-risk cargo from low- or no- risk cargo is extremely important to BCBP because searching each and every cargo and traveler that enters the United States would cripple the flow of legitimate trade and travel. that help assess cargo risk. When information or intelligence is incomplete or unreliable, it can adversely impact BCBP’s ability to identify potentially risky cargo for inspection. We are currently reviewing how BCBP is targeting cargo for further inspection and how such cargo is inspected at ports. Since this work is ongoing, and involves information that BCBP also considers to be law enforcement, we are reviewing how we are handling the targets generated by the model at sea ports, and whether and howBCBP intends to evaluate targeting. sensitive, we are precluded from discussing specific aspects of this matter in this unclassified statement. However, our work to date shows that BCBP’s targeting efforts face a range of challenges relating to threat assessments, actionable intelligence, and nonintrusive inspection technology. Having sufficient numbers of well-trained and motivated staff is also key to identifying high-risk cargo. Inspectors and canine officers are trained to detect unusual or abnormal behaviors or circumstances that suggest a potential threat or unlawful activity. inspectors are challenged by the tight timeframes and pressures they work under to move legitimate cargo through the ports. relying on inspectors alone can increase the risk that contraband enters the country. The inspection of incoming foreign mail remains largely a manual process that relies primarily on physical examination. We found several challenges relating to this process, but BCBP’s determination that our results were law enforcement sensitive precludes our discussing them here. However, at the time our work was completed, one courier was working with the former Customs Service. to pilot test an advance manifest system. The database is intended to allow Customs to analyze incoming package information and make more informed decisions about what packages to inspect. Large-scale x-ray and gamma–ray imaging systems, portal radiation monitors, and portable and hand-held radiation detection devices can reduce the need for costly, intensive inspections and save inspection time and resources. As important as the use of technology is, there are certain limitations and challenges that need to be considered, according to the U.S. Customs Service. For example, we reviewed Customs’ acquisition and deployment of radiation detection equipment. Experts we contacted did not view pagers as search instruments but rather as personal safety devices. In trying to achieve the commercial-security balance, BCBP is challenged to ensure that antiterrorism efforts do not slow the flow of legitimate international commerce and travel. According to BCBP, it says it is working on a plan to reduce the number of radiation pagers being used by the Customs service to a maximum of 1,000. has worked with importers on concerns such as where their goods originated, the physical security and integrity of their overseas plants and those of their foreign suppliers. BCBP has reaffirmed to importers the importance of knowing their customers and has examined the security practices of their freight forwarders and the routes their shipments travel. AlthoughBCBP has made some progress in implementing initiatives that are designed to improve the efficiency of its regulation of commercial trade, there is still a long way to go, the agency says. activities, additional challenges remain, particularly in view of the new and heightened emphasis on terrorism. These challenges include (1) continuing to improve its evolving trade compliance program and (2) acquiring a new trade processing system. The volume of trade is expected to surpass $2 trillion in the year 2006. To speed the processing of imports and improve compliance with trade laws, specifically, the Customs Modernization and Informed Compliance program is being implemented. The program is intended to speed the Processing of Imports and improve Compliance with U.S. trade laws. Act of 1993 (also known as the ‘Mod Act’), BCBP’s predecessor, Customs, developed an “informed compliance strategy’ In 1999, we recommended that the Customs Service develop and implement an evaluation of the effectiveness of its informed compliance strategy. Customs agreed with our recommendation and completed its Trade Compliance Strategy Study on May 24, 2001. The study indicated that the strategy improves compliance, but the impact on overall compliance rates is small. For example, one initiative, the Company Enforced Compliance Process (CECP), was to address large importers’ noncompliance. to the study, Customs was to punish noncomplying companies by imposing “confirmed risk” designations, increasing examinations, removing privileges, and referring for penalties. However, the confirmed risk status was only used six times, and loss of privileges and referral for penalties were never used. The study concluded that CECP was not much of an enforced compliance process, and it was discontinued. On the other hand, the study found that the companies’ compliance rates increased after they participated in the other initiatives. The Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) is expected to cost about $1.7 billion and is to replace Customs’ antiquated system. Expected benefits from ACE include speeding the flow of legitimate commerce into and out of the United States, identifying and targeting high-risk commerce requiring greater scrutiny, and providing a greater level of scrutiny. To learn more about the ACE and other initiatives, visit the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's website at: http://www.dhs.gov/. single interface between the trade community and the federal government for trade data. In April 2001, Customs awarded a 5-year contract, with options to extend the contract to not more than 15 years. Successfully managing a project as large and complex as ACE is a challenging undertaking. Over the last 4 years, we have reported on ACE and recommended steps Customs needed to take to minimize project risks. To its credit, Customs has taken action to implement our recommendations, as follows: We recommended Customs incrementally justify the ACE investment. defined and committed to implement process controls for justifying and making ACE investment decisions incrementally. After implementing the first ACE release, Customs plans to verify that actual costs and benefits meet expectations and plans to continue this incremental investment approach for the remaining ACE releases. Customs ensured that its enterprise architecture contained sufficient detail to build the firstACE release and has aligned the release with the enterprise architecture. We recommended Customs have sufficient resources to build subsequent ACE releases and will continue to extend its enterprise Architecture as necessary to build future releases. We recommended Customs develop rigorous and analytically verifiable cost estimating. We recommended Customs employ effective software acquisition processes. Customs developed and plans to implement a human capital management strategy for the Customs modernization office, which is responsible for managing the ACE acquisition. Customs continues to make progress and has plans to establisheffective software acquisition process controls, as embodied primarily in the second level of SEI’s Software Acquisition Capability Maturity. We recommend Customs develop and implement a cost- estimating program that employs the tenets of effective cost estimating as defined by the Software Engineering Institute. Model. Customs has made progress in implementing some, but not all, of our recommendations. Customs is in the early stages of acquiring ACE, many challenging tasks remain before Customs will have implemented full ACE capability. To prevent illegal entry of individuals into the United States between the ports of entry, BCBP has deployed significant resources but estimates significantly more are needed. Continued implementation of the southwest border strategy faces a range of challenges, including meeting hiring goals and obtaining needed approvals to deploy fencing and technology to implement its strategy. along the northern border, mitigating the negatives affects the strategy may have on communities that experience an increase in illegal alien traffic. At our nation’s ports, BCBP faces an array of challenges, including improving inspectors’ ability to verify the identity of travelers and whether they can be admitted into the country, unifying and enhancing inspector training, and complying with the congressional mandate to implement a system to track the entry and exit of all aliens. The strategy is aimed at deterring illegal entry between the nation's ports of entry. entry will continue to be a challenge for BCBP. In previous work, we reported that the Border Patrol had estimated that significantly more resources would be needed to fully implement its border control strategy. The strategy postulated that as resources were applied in one area, the flow of illegal alien traffic would shift. The Border Patrol has been implementing a phased strategy to increase deterrence to illegal entry beginning, first, with the areas that had the largest influx of illegal aliens. In 1994, the strategy was put into effect. to other locations along the southwest border where resources had yet to be applied. The Border Patrol estimated it would need between 11,700 and 14,000 agents, additional support personnel, and hundreds of millions of dollars in additional technology and infrastructure. We reported that it would take at least 5 more years (until 2006) to reach the minimum number of agents the Border Patrol believed it needed along the Southwest border if (1) the administration’s agent hiring goals at the time were met. The Border Patrol currently has about 9,500 agents deployed along the southwest border. That is nearly a 3-fold increase from the 3,400 agents the Border Patrol had along the Southwest border in 1994. It is still about 2,200 agents short of the minimum number needed to deter illegal entry along the northern border. The Border Patrol continues to face hiring challenges to meet its estimated needs, the agency said in a statement. The agency said it will continue to hire agents until the needs are met. 11,700, the Border Patrol said it needed to fully implement the southwest border strategy. Currently, the border patrol has 567 agents deployed along the northern border. The Border Patrol experienced difficulties hiring agents and delays in obtaining approvals needed to deploy technology and build fences. The border patrol also recognized the need to make outreach to the Mexican people. It had taken the Border patrol longer to implement the strategy than originally planned because, among other things, it had experienced difficulties recruiting agents and obtaining approvals. efforts to communities because its initial failure to warn some communities about anticipated increases in illegal alien traffic caught community officials by surprise. Concerns have been raised over the environmental impact of current plans to build additional fencing along the border in Arizona. When apprehensions surged in communities into which the illegal alien Traffic was reportedly pushed, officials and residents in one community reported experiencing loss of business, destruction of private property, and environmental degradation. A recent news article described how some local residents were angered by the increased traffic. The Border Patrol has realized its goal of shifting illegal alien traffic away from urban areas into more remote areas. Many aliens have instead risked injury and death by trying to cross mountains, deserts, and rivers. This prompted the Border Patrol to implement a Border Safety Initiative consisting of, among other things, a media campaign to warn aliens about the dangers of crossing illegally, as well as establishing a hotline for reporting illegal crossings. The hotline can be reached at 1-800-273-8255 or by clicking here. search-and-rescue units. Since then apprehensions along the southwest border have declined to less than 1 million in fiscal year 2002. While there may be many reasons for the decline in apprehensions, in response to our recommendation, the Border Patrol has developed a plan designed to evaluate the impacts of its southwest border strategy. The Border Patrol will release a report on the impact of the southwest strategy on apprehensions in the coming months. The report will be published in a special edition of The New York Times, on sale now. BCBP inspectors continue to face challenges that those from their predecessor agencies also faced in balancing the need to identify violators of immigration and other laws. With nearly 200 countries issuing unique passports, official stamps, seals, and visas, the potential for document fraud is great. A variety of documents are accepted at ports, and many can be counterfeited or used fraudulently with apparent ease. BCBP will also face an array of challenges in ensuring that its border inspectors are adequately trained, including ensuring appropriate training is provided in the detection of fraudulent documents. work at 15 land border ports, suggest that one training challenge for BCBP will be to ensure that both new and experienced border inspectors are capable of readily detecting fraudulent documents. The Bureau will also face challenges regarding the collection, analysis, and use of intelligence information in the field. In 1997, an INS-contracted study reported the lack of an intelligence capability at all INS locations, including districts and ports. More recent studies suggest needs in this area persist. The former INS recognized the need for more intelligence support in theField. DHS is merging intelligence positions from the former Customs and INS. One of the most significant challenges facing DHS at ports of entry is the implementation of the U.S. VISIT system. This significant undertaking is intended to capture both entry and exit data on travelers. It will also have many implications for operations at U.K. ports and in the Middle East, according to a report by the Center for Security Policy and the RAND Corporation. The report was published by the RAND Corp. and is based on a joint report by RAND and the Government Accountability Office. of entry, including expenditures, staffing, inspection procedures, and infrastructure. We reviewed INS’s fiscal year 2002 expenditure plan and associated system acquisition documentation and system plans. We found that the initial plan did not provide sufficient information about INS commitments for the system. We concluded that this lack of detail is a material limitation in our ability to evaluate the system and its value to the U.S. government. For confidential support, call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or click here for details. the first plan that will become even more problematic in the future as the magnitude and complexity of the system acquisition increases. responsibility for implementing U.S. VISIT now resides in the Border and Transportation Security directorate. We are currently reviewing the fiscal year 2003 expenditure plan and will ascertain whether these problems were addressed. We designated implementation and transformation of the new Department of Homeland Security as high risk based on three factors. First, the implementation and transformed of DHS is an enormous undertaking that will take years to complete. will take time to achieve in an effective and efficient manner. Failure to effectively carry out its mission would expose the nation to potentially very serious consequences. DHS, with an anticipated budget of almost $40 billion and an estimated 170,000 employees, will be the third largest government agency; not the first. In the aftermath of September 11, invigorating the nation’s homeland security missions has become one of the federal government’S most significant challenges, the report says. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is the nation's second-largest government agency. DOD was formed almost entirely from agencies whose principal mission was national defense. Effectively implementing and transforming DHS may be an even more daunting challenge. DHS will combine 22 agencies specializing in various disciplines: law enforcement, border security, biological research, among others. It will take many years to achieve, and even today, the department continues to face enduring management challenges and high- risk areas that are, in part, legacies of its unfinished integration. The Department of Defense was created more than 50 years ago. disaster mitigation, and computer security, for instance. DHS will oversee a number of non-homeland-security activities, such as the Coast Guard’s marine safety responsibilities. The magnitude of the responsibilities, combined with the challenge and complexity of the transformation, underscores the perseverance and dedication that will be required of all DHS’S leaders, employees, and stakeholders to achieve success. Further, it is well recognized that mergers are necessary to achieve the synergy that can help provide better security against terrorism. of this magnitude in the public and private sector carry significant risks, including lost productivity and inefficiencies. Successful transformations of large organizations, even those undertaking less strenuous reorganizations, can take from 5 to 7 years to achieve. Necessary management capacity and oversight mechanisms must be established. Critical aspects of DHS’s success will depend on well-functioning relationships with third parties that will take time to establish and maintain, says John Defterios, former director of the Department of Homeland Security. the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, DOD, and the Department of Health and Human Services. Creating and maintaining a structure that can leverage partners and stakeholders will be necessary to effectively implement the national homeland security strategy. The new department is also being formed from components with a wide array of existing major management challenges and program risks. For instance, one DHS directorate’s responsibility includes the protection of critical information systems that we already consider a high risk. In fact, many of the major components merging into the new department include the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), FEMA, and DOD. TSA and the U.S. Coast Guard, face at least one major problem. TSA has had considerable challenges in meeting deadlines for screening baggage. The Coast Guard faces the challenges inherent in a massive fleet modernization. DHS’s national security mission is of such importance that the failure to address its management challenges is a failure to meet its mission, says the report. The report was published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. It was co-authored by David Frum and Peter Bergen. and programs risks could have serious consequences on our intergovernmental system, our citizens’ health and safety, and our economy. Overall, our designation of the implementation and transformation of DHS as a high-risk area stems from the importance of its mission and the nation’s reliance on its effectiveness.

Summary:
 suppression aircraft focus on trying to neutralize, degrade, or destroy the enemy’s air defense radar equipment. Aircraft launch antiradiation missiles that can search for and destroy enemy radars if they are turned on. Since the end of Desert Storm in 1991, U.S. suppression aircraft have been continuously deployed to protect fighter aircraft maintaining the no-fly zones over Iraq. In 1999, during Operation Allied Force in Yugoslavia and Kosovo, these aircraft were extremely important for protecting strike aircraft. In February 2002, the Navy had only 91 EA-6Bs available for operations instead of the 104 required. As a result, while the Navy has been able to meet operational commitments, it has been unable to meet some of its training and exercise requirements. The Navy plans to replace a total of 67 wing center sections.that has been delayed until March 2004. But wing fatigue has continued to grow, and the Navy may have to ground additional aircraft. It is currently taking action to remedy wing fatigue and engine failures. The Navy will spend $4.4 million each for such replacements for 17 aircraft in the fiscal year 2002 budget. In 2001, the Navy also began experiencing problems with the EA-6B’s engines. Premature failure of certain engine bearings caused some engines to fail, and it may have caused the crash of two aircraft in 2001. The Navy grounded over 50 engines until they could be overhauled, and the Navy is programming funds for 10 more wing replacements for each year in the Future Years Defense Plan. The constant deployment of this “low density” EA-6B fleet for contingency operations has contributed to its deterioration and to other maintenance- related problems. The constant deployments also added to personnel problems in terms of quality of life. The Navy expects to have them back in service by late this year. But it expects to be back to full service by the end of the year. The U.S. Navy has not commented on the report. The report was compiled by CNN's John Defterios and published by the Center for Military Analysis. The Navy says it needs a replacement aircraft to begin entering the force by 2009 if requirements are to be met. The Navy has been upgrading its EA-6B electronic warfare equipment over the years, and it is currently in need of a new fleet of the aircraft. All of the current aircraft will be out of the Navy's fleet by 2015, and the Navy needs to have a replacement ready by 2009 to meet force structure requirements in 2009. The new aircraft will have a range of up to 2,000 miles. modifying its radar signal receiver and related equipment. The modification program, known as the Improved Capability Program (ICAP) III, provides improved radar locating and jamming capabilities. The Navy expects ICAP III to reach initial operational capability in 2005 and to be installed on all EA-6Bs by 2010, about the time when the aircraft begins to reach the end of its service life. As of January 2002, ICap III engineering and manufacturing development was about 94 percent complete, and the modification began testing on the first aircraft in November 2001. Navy is considering using a modified version of the ICAP III equipment on whatever follow-on suppression aircraft are developed and fielded. The Air Force is procuring 30 additional F-16CJ suppression aircraft to meet force structure requirements for the Air Force’s Aerospace Expeditionary Forces. To fully implement its concept of operations for the Expeditionary forces, the Air Air Force also plans to increase the capability of the latest model F- 16C/Ds (block 40) and the F-15CJs (block 25) The F-16C/Ds will be modified to carry the HARM Targeting System. The Advanced Target Pod will enable the F- 16CJs to deliver precision-guided munitions. The upgrade (known as R-6) provides better and faster targeting information to HARM missiles. The Air Force is procuring additional systems to upgrade the system to R-5.50 (R-6.50) to be used for both attack and suppression missions. The upgrades are expected to be completed by 2015. The F-16CJ still lacks some of the capabilities of the retired F-4G. The Air Force completed the R-6 upgrade on fielded systems in December 2001. Once 31 additional systems are delivered in 2002, the F- 16CJs will have a total inventory of 202 systems. Also, the Air Force has partially funded additional upgrades (called R-7) for the HARM Targeting System in 2003, and plans to fully fund the upgrade in 2004. The U.S. Air Force’s original goal of having 1.1 systems per aircraft, or about 240 systems, was met. The Air Force is also upgrading the capabilities of the EC-130 Compass Call Aircraft, which perform primarily communications jamming missions. The upgrades are intended to improve the aircraft’s jamming capabilities, reliability, and maintainability. Officials also stated that they are considering funding for additional R-7 HARM Targeting Systems for F-16CJs and F- 16C/Ds in the 2004 budget submission. The Air Force has a total of only 13 operational aircraft, of which 11 are being funded for upgrade. aircraft make it essential that other aircraft have the ability to protect themselves from enemy defenses. The services have already identified serious reliability problems with current self-protection systems on U.S. combat aircraft. Most of the current systems use older technology and have logistics support problems due to obsolescence. In reviewing test results using the new Joint Service Electronic Combat System Tester, we found that aircraft the services believed to be mission worthy had problems with self- protection systems. Also, as we reported last year, the self- Protection systems on strike aircraft may have more problems than the services estimate. capable were not because of faults in their electronic combat systems that were undetected by older test equipment. For example, 41 of 44 F-15C aircraft and 10 of 10 F-18C aircraft previously believed to be fully mission capable were subsequently found to have one or more faults. The faults ranged from the identification of parts needing to be replaced inside the electronic combat system, to the wiring, antennas, and control units that connect the systems to the aircraft. Coupled with the problems in the suppression aircraft, these shortcomings could be fatal. create survivability problems for the aircraft should they encounter significant enemy air defense capabilities in some future conflict. The services have some programs underway to improve self-protection capabilities, but they face technology challenges and/or a lack of funding priority. The Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD), which an Air Force analysis has shown could make a significant contribution to aircraft survivability, illustrates this problem. DOD has acknowledged the gap in U.S. air defense suppression capabilities for some time and has conducted several studies to identify solutions. Institute for Defense Analyses studied problems in acquiring electronic warfare systems. Institute found several causes for the problems, including uncertainties in characterizing rapidly changing threats and systems requirements. Lack of adequate and stable funding, complexity of electronic warfare hardware and software also cited. Institute recommended that DOD establish central offices for electronic warfare matters in the Joint Chiefs of Staff and in each service, create a senior oversight panel, and prepare an annual electronic warfare roadmap to help correct some of the problems DOD faces in electronic warfare acquisition programs.

Summary:
The House passed the Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act in October 2011. The Senate introduced the Coal Ash Recycling and Oversight Act of 2012 in August 2012. The bills would have created a framework that states could use to create permit programs for the "management and disposal" of coal combustion residuals (CCRs) The approach to creating state permit programs was largely the same in each bill, says the report. It is difficult to determine in advance how such statutory specifications may be interpreted by each state, it says. Proposed standards for CCR surface impoundments were modeled on the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) regulations in 30 C.F.R. Part 77. House and Senate bills would add to Subtitle D of RCRA a new Section 4011, "Management and Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals" The bills would encourage states to create permit programs according to statutory standards included in the amendment. The proposed standards include criteria EPA deemed necessary to control contaminant leaching and migration.

Summary:
Most Navy ships procured since the late 1950s have been funded in accordance with the full funding policy. Full funding policy means that DOD cannot contract for the construction of a new weapon or piece of equipment until funding for the entire cost of that item has been approved by Congress. Congress's decision on ship funding approaches could also affect future Navy capabilities, annual Navy funding requirements, and the shipbuilding industrial base. The issue for Congress is whether to maintain current practices for funding Navy ship procurement or change them.

Summary:
Congress has been deeply involved for decades in setting policy, providing funding, and supporting or rejecting programs for the nuclear weapons enterprise. For example, it established the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a semi-autonomous component of the Department of Energy. It also rejected a major facility to manufacture a key nuclear weapon component. It initiated and later rejected the Reliable Replacement Warhead; and directed NNSA, the Government Accountability Office, and others to conduct studies on nuclear weapon issues. One U.S. policy is not to build new-design nuclear weapons for new missions. Some argue that the capacity to manufacture new pits may be needed to extend the service life of certain existing weapons. A pit is a hollow plutonium shell that is imploded with conventional explosives to create a nuclear explosion that triggers the rest of the weapon. During the Cold War, the Rocky Flats Plant was the U.S.'s only nuclear weapons production facility. It was closed in the 1990s. Rocky Flats manufactured as many as 2,000 pits per year (ppy) In 1989, armed agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Environmental Protection Agency raided Rocky Flats to investigate suspected environmental crimes. DOE first suspended pit production later that year, subsequently halted it permanently, and eventually dismantled the plant and remediated the site. Congress and the Administration searched for many years for a way to make pits. NNSA proposed a two-track strategy. In one track, Plutonium Facility 4 (PF-4), the main plutonium building at Los Alamos National. Laboratory (LANL) (NM), would house a pilot plant to develop pit production processes and manufacture a small number of pits. It took until 2007 for LANL to make its first "war reserve" pits, i.e., those certified for use in the stockpile. In that year, LANL made 11 such pits, the highest number since 1989. The second track involved a facility with the capacity to make pits on an industrial scale, on the order of 100 or more ppy. The U.S. has no plans to build a pit facility. PF-4, which opened for operations in 1978, is the last plutonium processing building to come online. As of June 2014, NNSA had the capacity to produce up to 450 ppy of plutonium. NNSA has no immediate plans to increase production of plutonium to that level, however. The agency has no current plans to produce more than 125 ppy at any one time, though it has the capability to produce as much as 500 ppy. manufacture about 10 non-war reserve pits per year in PF-4. War reserve (WR) pits are those judged acceptable for use in the nuclear stockpile. Other pits are manufactured for such purposes as development or process qualification. With most work atPF-4 halted in June 2013, the actual manufacturing rate in June 2014 was zero for pits of any type; work is resuming at the end of June 2014. Since there was no requirement to manufacture WR pits, some processes needed to certify pits as WR had been suspended after the halt. NNSA anticipates manufacturing a few pits a year in the near future to prepare to manufacture WR pits. The schedule for ramping up pit production is uncertain. A Department of Defense (DOD) official stated in 2013 that there is no daylight between the Department of Energy and the Defense on the need for a near-term pit manufacturing capacity of 10 to 20 and then 30 by 2021, and then in the longer term for a capacity of 50 to 80 per year.previous WR build of W88 pits was completed in FY2011. Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) document stated, "Preliminary plans call for pit production of potentially up to 80 pits per year starting as early as FY 2030" In 2014, an NNSA document changed the date for achieving a 30-ppy capacity to "by 2026" Section 3114 of the FY2015 defense authorization bill, H.R. 4435 , as passed by the House, would require NNSA to produce 30 WR pits during 2023, at least 50 during 2026. and to demonstrate for at least 90 days during 2027 the ability to manufacture WR pits at a rate of 80 per year. Some favor a capacity of greater than 80 ppy, while others argue that a lower number would suffice. The debate over that capacity would take on added salience to the extent that it moves within the realm of the military's range. The report focuses on how to achieve the high end of DOD's range because that is the high-end of its range. It is beyond the scope of this report. Congress remains deeply involved in efforts to increase pit production capacity. Section 3114 of H.R. 4435 sets a schedule for production of WR pits. In its report on S. 2410, the Senate Armed Services Committee directed NNSA to include construction of modules (described later) The modules would support an exit from a 1950s-era plutonium strategy. The modules are described later in this article. For confidential support, call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or see www.samaritans.org. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a substantial increase in funding. Use of retired pits in life extension programs would reduce the number of new pits that would have to be manufactured. The committee also recommended $35.7 million for moving certain activities at LANL by 2019. It would be a separate line item in the FY2016 budget "to add additional visibility into the process," the committee said in a report. The report was published by the Center for American Progress, a nonprofit that promotes free and open dialogue. out of the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research building (described below), which became operational in 1952. While DOD has a requirement for up to 80 ppy, some key questions about how to manufacture at that rate remain not only unanswered but also unasked. Without answers to these questions, Congress cannot know whether existing buildings, without modifications, could manufacture 80 pPy; or if modest upgrades would suffice. If major construction would be needed to augment capacity, this report provides a framework for such construction. This report presents three key decisions and an approach to help structure them. It focuses on two metrics: the amount of two facility resources (laboratory floor space and Material At Risk (MAR), discussed next) available for pit manufacturing. It shows that it is not known whether available amounts suffice. While NNSA has extrapolated space, it has not determined how much will be needed to meet the needs of the pit industry. It also raises the possibility that Congress may choose to direct NNSA to generate the data needed to answer these questions. Space and MAR requirements for manufacturing 80 ppy have never been calculated rigorously, though they could be. Comparing space and MAR required vs. available would show whether there is enough space andMAR at the moment. Over time, however, various factors will affect availability and requirements. This report discusses ways to offset any adverse effects from these factors. In addition, decisions will be needed to make the right decisions for the future of the industry in the U.S. and around the world. Pit fabrication casts "hemishells" (half-pits) of plutonium, machines them to remove excess material, and welds two together to form a pit. Pit manufacturing also involves such supporting tasks as purifying plutonium for use in pits, certification to ensure that finished pits meet required standards, material control and accountability; waste management; and analytical chemistry. For background, see CRS Report R43406, U.S. Nuclear Weapon "Pit" Production Options for Congress. Pit fabrication requires extensive AC for every pit. AC supports other pit manufacturing tasks, and non-pit tasks as well. The building at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) that currently performs AC to support pit manufacture and many other plutonium tasks is in poor shape and not seismically robust. DOE wants to halt work there by 2019, so one or more other facilities will be needed. Laboratory floor space , or "space," is needed for pit fabrication. Laboratory buildings have space for corridors, offices, etc., but not floor space. "Material At Risk" (MAR) is "the amount of radioactive materials … available to be acted on by a given physical stress" It is material that could be released by a disaster, such as an earthquake that collapses a building followed by a fire. Each building that works with plutonium has a building-specific MAR allowance. MAR is expressed in units of plutonium equivalent. Plutonium is the fissile material in pits. Four forms are relevant here: Plutonium-239 (Pu-239) Pu-239 is the fissile isotope in pits. pits contain other plutonium isotopes in addition to Pu-239. That mixture is called weapons-grade plutonium (WGPu) Since some of the other isotopes are more radioactive than Pu- 239, WGPu is about 1.5 times as radioactive as Pu-238. It is relevant to pit manufacturing options because 40% of the MAR allowance in PF-4 is allocated to Pu.238. Moving some or all Pu- 238 work out ofPF-4, the main pit manufacturing tool. plutonium building at LANL, would make MAR and space available for other purposes. MAR is measured in units of plutonium equivalent (PE), which is about 1.38 times as radioactive as Pu-239. This measure is linked to potential dose if plutonium is released, such as by an earthquake and fire. PF-4 is the only building in the United States with the combination of attributes required to make pits. Its current MAR allowance is 1,800 kg PE. It is located atLANL, the nation's "center of plutonium production" PF-4 is the last U.S. plutonium processing facility to be brought online, in 1978. It is the only remaining U.s. multi-program, multi-function plutoniumprocessing facility. It would be about a half-century old when production is anticipated to reach 80 ppy. The Chemistry and Metallurgy Research (CMR) building currently provides AC support for limited pit support. The only place that has made pits since 1989, LANL has the scientific, engineering, and craft expertise needed to make pits. The Radiological Laboratory-Utility-Office Building (RLUOB, pronounced "rulob") was completed in FY2010. It is configured for AC. NNSA plans that RLUOB would house AC equipment needed to support pit manufacture, and possibly enough to support manufacture of 80 ppy. The building is "genuinely decrepit" and "structurally unsound," in the words of two studies, and is much more vulnerable to collapse in an earthquake than more recent buildings. In 1992, the United States began a moratorium on nuclear testing that continues to the present. An issue became how to demonstrate confidence in the safety and reliability of these weapons. One approach, developed by LANL and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), was Quantification of Margins and Uncertainties, or QMU. This section describes that approach, then modifies it to make it applicable to pits. The idea underlying QMU is that nuclear weapons can be maintained without testing. QMU was that several steps in a nuclear weapon must all work for the weapon to function. Each step, or "gate" in QMU terminology, can be quantified. For example, a certain amount of energy must be transmitted to the secondary for it to detonate. Another QMU concept is margin. If the minimum amount of. energy needed to. detonate the secondary is X, and the amount needed to detonated the secondary. is Y, then the margin is X. of energy predicted to be transmitted to the secondary is 3X, then there is a margin of 2X, i.e., margin is the amount by which the predicted quantity exceeds the minimum required quantity. Did the calculation incorporate all relevant variables? Were there biases in experiments on which the calculations were based? Were the most relevant nuclear tests used as a data source? The uncertainty can be quantified through calculations (such as computer models); further, the amount of uncertainty is bounded because each gate has an upper and a lower. QMU provides three key concepts relevant to decisionmaking on pit manufacturing. Margin is the amount by which (1) space available for pit manufacturing exceeds (2) space required to manufacture 80 ppy. The degree of confidence at each gate is expressed as margin divided by uncertainty; the higher the number, the greater the confidence.limit. If margin exceeds uncertainty for a particular gate, then there can be confidence that the weapon will "pass through" that gate satisfactorily, and if margin exceeds. uncertainty for all gates, there is confidence that it will work. by which (3) MAR available for pit manufacturing exceeds (4) MAR required to manufacture 80 ppy. (The two margins are independent.) Thus, solving for margin requires four numbers. LANL has examined space and MAR needed to fabricate 80 p py in a preliminary fashion, but has not performed a detailed analysis of the full pit manufacturing process, including plutonium supply, waste management, AC, external support activities, and fabrication. To enable calculation of margin, Congress would need to obtain two numbers. Nuclear weapons complex has ample space and MAR for AC for 80 ppy. Uncertainty: Margins can change over time. It would not be acceptable to let uncertainties that materialize into actual events reduce margin below zero. A study would need to take into account that there are many ways to make more space or MAR available and to reduce space orMAR requirements, thereby increasing margin.. A detailed analysis would be needed to determine whether enough MAR allowance and space could be made available in PF-4 to manufacture 80 p py. On the other hand, AC to analyze process problems requires fast turnaround to minimize the time the process is shut down. Increasing the amount of plutonium would require adding electrorefining furnaces, increasing space requirements. Since the United States no longer produces plutonium, all U.S. plutonium is "old," such as from retired pits. As plutonium decays, it produces other elements, such as uranium and americium. These must be removed by chemical processes to purify plutonium for use in new pits. PF-4 uses 10,400 sf for plutonium recycle and purification. How much plutonium could that area purify per year? How many ppy would that capacity support? How much more space would be needed to provide plutonium for 80 ppy? Alternatively, could these processes be moved to another site, such as Savannah River Site? Pit fabrication generates some plutonium scraps. Providing for recycle of this plutonium requires space, and producing 80 p py would require more space than 30. How much space would plutonium disposition require? While major construction could make more space available, increasing efficient use of existing space could increase the space margin. LANL is currently redesigning the existing pit fabrication space in PF-4. The process line was intended as a pilot plant to develop, quickly, techniques for resuming production. It was not intended as the nation's pit production site; other proposed facilities, such as the Modern Pit Facility, were to fill that role. It could be done in several ways, including: Designing work flow to minimize space utilization. PF-4 to manufacture up to 30 ppy instead of 10; increased efficiencies of this type would reduce space requirements for 80 ppy, increasing margin. Develop equipment and processes for faster work flow so fewer pieces of equipment to manufacture a specified number of pits, reducing floor space. Repurpose unused space or space used for lower-priority programs, as discussed. Make more efficient use of PF-4's basement, which houses the nuclear materials vault and most utilities, and provides space for shipping and receiving and for staging waste drums. drum storage, freeing space to house such laboratory-floor operations as nondestructive analysis, and some waste management operations. Move some equipment out of PF-4. For example, a gas gun, which propels a metal slug into a plutonium target to study how plutonium behaves under impact. The gas gun uses 1,200 sf of laboratory space inPF-4 and some basement space. Moving it to RLUOB (if that building's MAR were to be increased substantially) or to another site would release space. of space by allowing fewer pieces of equipment to produce a given amount of product, thereby reducing space requirements. Rocky Flats Plant, for example, generally operated using three shifts per day. On the other hand, a higher tempo for an extended period could increase operating cost, require more maintenance, reduce time available for maintenance, and increase the likelihood of equipment failure. Such options would almost surely be faster and less costly than major construction, but without data on space required for 80 ppy, it is not possible to know if they would. provide enough space. As with space, there are options to provide more MAR. The total MAR allowance for PF-4 on February 27, 2013, was 1,800 kg PE. Pu-238 work accounted for 24.5% of that allowance; pit fabrication, for 16.4%; and other tasks, for lesser amounts. As noted, this analysis assumes that seismic upgrades increasePF-4 MAR to 2,600 kg PE, which is the current allowance. The gray space, 21.5%, represents the PF-3 MAR allowance unused on February 26, 2013. amount of MAR to the same scale as Table 1 and assumes that programs other than pit manufacturing use the MAR they used on February 27, 2013, for the foreseeable future. It shows that if the newly-available 800 kg PE of MAR and the unallocated MAR are both allocated to pit manufacturing and combined with the pit fabrication MAR, then 57.0% of the MAR in PF-4 would be available for pit work. (While the amount of MAR used by other tasks remains the same, the percentage of MAR they use is lower than in Table 1 because each task accounts for different amounts of MAR) for a smaller fraction of the higher MAR allowance. If adding 800 kg of MAR is not sufficient to support 80 ppy, at least three other options would release more MAR. While Pu-238 is only a small fraction of PF-4's radioactive material by weight, it is so radioactive that it is allocated 40% of the MAR allowance, though it did not use that much on February 27, 2013. Nor is MAR spread evenly within a program space, as discussed below. For more information, or to request a copy of the report, visit the National Nuclear Security Administration website. Plutonium Recycle and Purification (PRP) uses aqueous (plutonium dissolved in acid) processes and molten processes to recover pure plutonium from scrap or from retired pits by chemically removing impurities. This option would move about 198 kg of MAR out of PF-4. Module 1 would have 1.5% as much MAR asPF-4 and Module 2 would house molten plutonium from Pit Fabrication and from PRP. (This would eliminate PRP within PF- 4.) 2 would have 6.5% as much. MAR available in PF-4 for pit manufacturing would increase to 62.5%. Option 2 would move the Pu-238 MAR contained in 5,000 sf ofPF-4 to one module. This option requires half as many modules as the first option. Under Option 2, pit fabrication would be allocated 72.4% of the 2,600 kg PE of MAR inPF-3. Under this option, the MAR available for repurposing would also be allocated to pit fabrication. and releases twice the MAR as Option 1. Option 3 (not shown) would move all Pu-238 work to INL or SRS. This would free up all the MAR, vs. 91% for Option 2. As with space, it may be possible to increase MAR margin without major construction. One approach is to strengthen PF-4 seismically to reduce the risk of building collapse through such steps as wrapping supporting columns in carbon fiber bonded with epoxy to strengthen them, anchoring them. wall more strongly to the ceiling, installing braces that tie columns to beams, building shear walls, and installing a drag strut on the roof of PF-4 (see Figure 5 ). Other steps could reduce the risk that plutonium would escape even ifPF-4 collapsed. plutonium escaping in an accident causes dose, and dose is the key factor in determining the amount of MAR permitted. Removing tons of combustible material from production areas could also reduce plutonium escape risk in the event of a building collapse. AC involves little MAR because it uses tiny samples, such as a few milligrams of plutonium dissolved in a small amount of acid. AC involves much more space per unit MAR than does pit fabrication because each laboratory instrument is housed in a glovebox or hood that might occupy a lot of space. Anchoring gloveboxes more strongly to the floor to reduce the likelihood that an earthquake would knock them over, exposing plutonium to the air, in which case a fire could generate plutonium oxide particles and release them into the atmosphere. Most pit-related AC is performed in the CMR building. NNSA plans to halt programmatic operations there "in approximately 2019" Producing 80 ppy would require additional AC, as AC must be performed for each pit. N NSA plans to achieve a 30-ppy capacity by FY2026, so work currently done in CMR would have to be performed elsewhere.dozen square feet of space. Many analyses must be done for each individual pit. The number of instruments and their housing increase in tandem with manufacturing capacity. on multiple samples for each pit, and increasing manufacturing capacity would require more equipment. Finding enough space and MAR for AC should be simpler than for pit manufacture because more options are readily available to meet requirements for AC. At the height of the Cold War, the Department of Energy's Rocky Flats Plant produced between 1,000 and 2,000 pits per year. Because currently-anticipated rates do not approach that level, the nuclear weapons complex has a considerable amount of excess plutonium that could be used. space and MAR suitable for AC. This capacity resides at several buildings in the complex, including Building 332 at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and Building 773-A at SRS. Each of these facilities would apparently have enough floor space and MAR allowance to conduct the AC needed to support manufacture of 80 ppy. PF-4 might perform some additional AC for higher-MAR work, such as sample preparation (which takes several-gram samples from larger pieces of plutonium) and certain analyses. For example, LANL is validating an AC system that may require a sample size of 1.5 mg of WGPu instead of 225 mg. Not at issue is that LANL would need the capability to perform all AC tasks even if it did not have the capacity to perform AC for 80 ppy. The case for having a second site perform some of the AC needed for 80ppy while maintaining the full suite is not clear. The issue is whether all AC should be done at LANL and, if not, how much AC should been done there and how much at another site.  LANL would gain little if any technical competence by conducting AC for 80 ppy vs., say, 40. It may be difficult to provide enough MAR and floor space at LANL for the AC. LANL and a second site could cross-check the accuracy of each other's AC measurements and processes from time to time. LNL and LLNL have for decades, since before the end of nuclear. LLLNL and RLUOB have a long history of working together. L LLNL and LLUOB work together regularly. testing, held that peer review is essential in developing or maintaining weapons. A second site could accommodate a surge in AC needs or provide a backup in case AC operations at LANL were suspended or disrupted. It might cost more to perform AC at two sites rather than one, but it would be better for the U.S. to have two sites instead of just one. The U.N. Secretary-General has called for the creation of a second site for plutonium AC testing, which would be based at a different location. A second site would necessitate shipping many plutonium samples per year from LANL to another site. It might be beneficial to have all plutonium AC technicians at one site so they would have the same training and operate according to the same formal and informal procedures. Concentrating as much plutonium work as possible at LANL would strengthen its position as the nation's plutonium center. While SRS and LLNL could both do this work, their facilities presumably have the facilities to do it.one, though it is impossible to know without the data. different capacities and would require different upgrades to support whatever level of AC was required. Data on the MAR and space requirements, and the cost of the LANL, LLNL, and SRS options, would be needed to provide a basis for decision. The option of having LLNL or SRS conduct a substantial fraction of the AC needed to support manufacture of 80 ppy must be evaluated in light of a revised path forward for AC that NNSA developed in June 2014. Based on an initial analysis by Los Alamos National Laboratory, NNSA determined that the combination of PF-4 and RLUOB withPF-4 would be the best solution. a higher plutonium limit, if properly equipped, could likely conduct all the AC needed to support manufacture of 80 ppy. NNSA further found that RLUOB would have sufficient space for the needed equipment. The planning for this approach will be conducted by personnel from NNSA headquarters (including the Office of Defense Programs) and Los Alamos National Laboratory over the summer and fall of 2014 to understand the costs and benefits of this approach. A Radiological Facility like RLU OB would be a good place to start. is permitted to hold up to 38.6 grams of plutonium-239 equivalent (Pu-239E), or 26 grams of WGPu. Radiological Facilities do not require stringent safety or security measures because the dose to onsite or offsite personnel in the event of a worst-case accident would be very low. NNSA considered several options for raising the MAR limit in RLUOB. One option was to retrofit the building by adding various safety upgrades to make it HC-3. the highest level (1760 grams WGPu) That option would have been costly and time-consuming. Another option was to create a "Hazard Category 4," splitting off the lower part of the HC-3 range into a separate category. That option, however, would have necessitated a revision of 10 C.F.R. 830, Nuclear Safety Management. The various limits on plutonium are based on the dose to onsite workers and on-site workers. The upper bound, say, 900 grams Pu-239E. offsite personnel that a worst-case accident could be expected to cause. There are myriad other regulations, all of which come together in a document called a Documented Safety Analysis, or DSA. While each building in the Hazard Category system requires a DSA, a Radiological Facility, such as RLUOB, does not because the amount of radioactive material in the building is not considered a hazard. The DSA is tailored to each building and specifies the amount the building can hold and still remain below the dose thresholds set by DOE Orders. is so small. NNSA calculated that RLUOB, with 400 grams WGPu, could likely be operated as HC-3 without significant facility modifications. Because of modern building features, the dose from the increased material in a worst-case accident would still be below the dose thresholds set by DOE Orders. Operating RLU OB as an HC-2 facility would not require congressional approval. Instead, congressional oversight would come through the normal reviews associated with the normal review process for such facilities. the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement (CMRR) line item construction project. CMRR-NF was "deferr[ed] … for at least five years" in the FY2013 budget request on cost grounds. NNSA plans to include funds for two subprojects in the C MRR construction project beginning with the FY2016 request. While there are no cost estimates for NNSA's path forward, it would cost substantially less than CMRr-NF because it would avoid building a large plutonium facility. Congress would need data on MAR margin, space margin, and cost for various pit manufacturing options. Data on space and MAR requirements are also needed to calculate margin. It might turn out that once seismic improvements are made, PF 4 would have enough space for 80 ppy. But without data, one cannot know which options are infeasible, which provide excess capacity and thus entail excess cost, and which are "just right" The following questions highlight how these data could support decisionmaking. The next step would be to estimate the cost of the feasible options. would release a little more MAR but another 4,600 sf, as compared to a module. Would one module release enough MAR and space in PF-4 for pit manufacture? (This assumes that the immediately-repurposable space inPF-4 would also be used for pit manufacturing.) If yes, would that be the case if pit casting were moved to the module, or if Pu-238 were moved in the same way? Would the module be the only place in the United States that performs high-MAR, high-security pit casting? work on plutonium and can manufacture pits. Unused space therefore represents opportunity for plutonium work forgone. Would moving the entire Pu-238 line, 9,600 sf, to another site have the same result? Or would the released space be needed to accommodate added equipment needed to manufacture 80 ppy? At present, RLUOB is permitted to have 26 grams of WGPu MAR for AC, which is not nearly enough to perform the AC for 80 p py. If this limit remains in If the MAR limit for RLUOB is increased to 400 grams of WGPu for AC, how much more MAR and space, if any, would be needed for AC at LLNL or SRS? If the 26-gram limit is retained for R LUOB, would it be less costly to perform the remaining AC atLLNL or at SRS. What would it cost to enable RLU OB to hold 400 grams W GPu? How much more space would it take to perform remaining AC? for 80 ppy, would it be less costly to perform the remaining AC at LLNL or at SRS? LANL is conducting projects to bolster the seismic robustness of PF-4. If 2,600 kg PE is not enough MAR, could additional projects raise the MAR allowance enough to accommodate manufacture of 80 p py? LANl maintains that each successive module should cost less than the one before it. On the other hand, it is possible to increase the MAR from 1,800 to 2, 600 kg PE (or more or less) that some lessons learned would lead to increased costs. What is the first module estimated to cost? The second? How sensitive is the cost of pit manufacturing to capacity, and what tradeoffs might a sensitivity analysis reveal? As a hypothetical example, if it cost an additional several billion dollars to move from 70 to 80 ppy, would it be worth spending the added money? Would it be less costly to move Pu-238 to INL, SRS, or a newly-built module? manufacture, Congress would likely want to know if there is enough space margin and MAR margin for 80 ppy. Margin, the available resource (space or MAR) minus the required resource, must be greater than zero. Available space and MAR are known, as of certain dates, as this report shows. Congress may choose to direct NNSA to provide these two numbers. For pit manufacturing, is there currently enough margin for space andMAR in PF-4? If not, what would Congress do? Excess space and MAR exist at other sites in the nuclear weapons complex. How much AC should be done at LANL, and what is needed to support that amount of AC? What steps can be taken to maintain these margins over decades in the face of uncertainties? What can be done to provide enough space and margin for pit manufacturing? What is needed for the future of nuclear weapons production in the U.S. and around the world? What are the implications for the world for nuclear weapons development and production? Analytical Chemistry (AC) analyzes plutonium samples taken from each pit at various stages in its manufacture. AC measures the isotopic composition of the plutonium and the amount of alloying materials and impurities a sample contains. AC typically uses samples on the order of milligrams. Before a pit type can be accepted into the stockpile, it must be certified as acceptable for war reserve use. This involves validating weapons codes, among other things. Validation, in turn, draws on experimental data. PF-4 prepares test items for experiments at the Nevada National Security Site that do not produce a nuclear yield. PF-4 supports some of these experiments, such as by preparing samples for analytical chemistry and materials characterization. MC measures bulk properties of plutonium such as tensile strength, magnetic susceptibility, grain structure, and surface characteristics. MC typically uses samples on the order of a fraction of a gram to measure these bulk properties. For more information, visit www.pf-4.data. Pit Fabrication involves casting "hemishells" (half-pits) of plutonium. ARIES converts excess pits to plutonium oxide (a powder) and places it in special containers for long-term storage. MR&R examines containers of plutonium in PF-4 that are to be sent to WIPP for permanent disposition. If the containers have deteriorated, MR& R repackages the plutonium in new containers.tens of grams of plutonium per kilogram of material. finished pit with x-ray imaging, physical measurements, etc., to ensure it meets specifications. Pits are monitored at Pantex Plant (TX) and PF-4.PF-4 monitoring techniques include taking physical measurements and checking for release of gases that may indicate deterioration of the pit. While Pantex can perform some of these tasks, pits can be disassembled only. The NNSA and its predecessor organizations have monitored the condition of nuclear weapons using a variety of techniques since the beginning of the nuclear weapons program. Pu-238 is the heat source for radioisotope power systems (RPS) for space probes. It is manufactured by bombarding rods of neptunium-237 with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. It undergoes radioactive decay much more rapidly than does Pu-239, producing uranium and other impurities. PF-4 receives Pu-238, removes the impurities through chemical processes, and makes plutonium oxide, which it presses into capsules. It mates some capsules with other equipment to make RPSs for military applications. capsules to Idaho National Laboratory, which does the same to make RPSs for space probes. Plutonium Recycle and Purification (PR&P): This area recovers plutonium from scrap plutonium (such as from lathe turnings, pits scrapped for not meeting standards, or retired pits) Plutonium is then precipitated out of solution as plutonium oxalate, and is then roasted to produce plutonium oxide. This area also recovers and purifies plutonium using high-temperature chemical processes. RTBF is NNSA's program for operating the nuclear weapons complex and maintaining its infrastructure. Within PF-4, RTBF space is used for functions that support multiple programs, such as shipping and receiving, waste management, and material control and accountability. NNSA operates the weapons complex from a base in Virginia, Virginia, which is home to the U.S. Navy's F/A-18 Hornet aircraft carrier. The F/E-18 is based in Virginia and is part of the Navy's P-4 fleet.

Summary:
NASA and its international partners are building the space station to serve as an orbiting research facility. The space shuttle is the primary vehicle supporting the assembly and resupply of the station. Figure 1 shows the Space Shuttle Endeavour docked to the International Space Station. Following the Columbia accident in February 2003, the NASA Administrator grounded the space shuttle fleet pending an investigation into the cause of the accident. The administrator appointed the Columbia Accident Investigation Board to determine the cause and to make recommendations for improving the safety of the space Shuttle. NASA plans to return the shuttle to flight in July 2005. While the shuttle has been grounded, space station crew transfers and logistics resupply have depended on Russian Soyuz and Progress vehicles. Europe and Japan are also developing logistics cargo vehicles to support space station operations later this decade. These Russian, European, and Japanese vehicles are launched on expendable rockets. The European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) is scheduled to be launched in 2010. It will be launched on an expendable rocket. available for missions to the space station in 2006. The ATV and HTV also carry less cargo than the shuttle. Because the Russian Soyuz and Progress are the only vehicles currently available and carry significantly less payload than the space shuttle, operations are generally limited to transporting crew. The Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) is scheduled to be available in 2008 and will fly within the proximity of the space space station to be caught by the station’s robotic arm before being berthed. Food, potable water, as well as propellant resupply for reboosting the space station to higher orbits. Launches of space station assembly elements and large orbital replacement items for maintenance have effectively ceased. NASA performed two studies that focused on the potential use of commercial launch vehicles to provide logistics services. In a 90-day study conducted in 2000, NASA determined that no commercial logistics service for the space space station was possible at that time. No launch vehicles possessed the critical capabilities necessary to providing logistics services, including automated rendezvous capabilities. The Alternate Access to Station (AAS) study contracts were awarded in July 2002, with 1-year contracts given to four contractors. In summer 2003, these contractors presented architectures that relied on existing domestic or international expendable launch vehicles. In the fall of 2003, the contracts were extended, and the contractors were asked to address larger cargo delivery capabilities and “downmass” (e.g. returning research materials to earth) requirements were added for the return of cargo. This led to a more detailed review of concepts to provide logistics services to the space station. study ended in January 2004 with the contractors briefing on their study results. NASA concluded that developing a domestic capability to meet most of the space station cargo service needs was possible within 3 to 5 years. In January 2004, the President announced a new Vision for Exploration that called for retiring the shuttle in 2010, requiring NASA to find an alternative to support space station operations through 2016 by the end of the decade. The President called for a shift in NASA’s long-term focus, envisioning that NASA will retire the space shuttle after nearly 30 years. of service as soon as assembly of the International Space Station is completed, planned for the end of the decade. In essence, NASA’s implementation plan holds aeronautics, science, and other activities at near constant levels and transitions funding currently dedicated to the space station and space shuttle programs to the new exploration strategy. The vision also changed the space stations’ on-board research focus. Originally, the space Station was to be used to conduct research on a variety of subjects. Under the new vision, the research will be focused on determining the effects of long duration space travel on humans and developing countermeasures. The space station research necessary to support human explorers on other worlds would be complete by 2016. According to program officials, NASA’s 2004 informal assessment concluded that alternative alternative plans were not viable. The new vision calls for the space station to be used for life sciences research on how humans adapt to long durations in space, biomedical research, and materials-processing research. launch vehicles would present operational risks, technical challenges, and long program delays and would cost more than returning the space shuttle to flight. According to previous studies and our discussions with commercial industry representatives, the time involved for developing an alternate capability would probably preclude assembly missions from consideration. NASA did not have sufficient knowledge to support its conclusion regarding logistic support missions, the authors say. The space shuttle is the best option for both assembly and logistics missions through the end of the decade, they say. They say. NASA is currently evaluating responses from commercial industry on different ways to provide logistics services to and from the space station. NASA did not have sufficient knowledge to conclude that the shuttle was the best option for logistics missions prior to its retirement of the shuttle in 2010. NASA officials stated that the technical challenges for developing an alternative vehicle could be overcome, but probably not before the 28 missions scheduled through 2010. We found no evidence of analyses performed by NASA to compare the cost and schedule impact of using alternate launch systems with scheduled space shuttle program costs. agency is examining configurations of the space station that meet the needs of the new vision and the international partners with as few space shuttle flights as necessary. Combining the information gathered from commercial industry and a better definition of space station requirements, NASA officials agreed there is an opportunity to perform a more comprehensive assessment of alternatives. Report: NASA should not limit documentation of this effort to the acquisition strategy meeting, but should also document the decision paths leading up to that event and throughout the evaluation of the transportation systems proposed by contractors. NASA conducted a detailed assessment of alternatives to the space shuttle for completing assembly and providing logistics support to the International Space Station. To accomplish our work, we visited and interviewed officials at NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C.; Johnson Space Center, Texas; and Kennedy Space Center,. These centers were chosen because they maintain primary responsibility for conducting space shuttle and space station operations on a day-to-day basis. We interviewed contractors at Boeing Launch Services and Lockheed Martin Space Systems and reviewed pertinent documentation related to expendable launch vehicles. at Kennedy Space Center. We also visited the Boeing Launch Services, Inc., in Huntington Beach, California, and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. Boeing Commercial Space Systems in Research Park, Huntsville, Alabama; and Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company in Littleton, Colorado. We conducted our work from August 2004 through April 2005 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. According to NASA officials involved in the 2004 assessment, accommodating a transition to other launch vehicles would create significant challenges that drive risk, schedule, and costs. designed and built to take advantage of the more benign launch environment in the space shuttle’s cargo bay. The following outlines the major challenges NASA identified. There would be a need to develop a new process to assemble the space station. Using another launch vehicle would require the redesign and retesting of space station elements already built due to the weight of the vehicle. The space station would be connected together by the space Shuttle crew during space walk activities. It would be assembled using only the space Station crew and without the benefit of the spaceshuttle remote manipulator arm. The space shuttle launch environment, with respect to vibration and g-force exerted on the payload, cannot be duplicated on an expendable launch vehicle. A new, unique transfer vehicle would need to be developed in order to rendezvous and dock assembly elements with the space station. Two transfer vehicles are currently being developed for logistics mission to support space station operations, the European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) and the Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicles (HTV) These vehicles, much like the Russian Progress vehicle, have a limited cargo capability. The ATV is being designed to rendezvous and dock to the space station via the Russian Service Module. The HTV is scheduled to be available in 2008. A carrier to go inside the new transfer vehicle to replicate the space shuttle attach points would need to be developed. According to these officials, in order to meet volume requirements, a carrier would be needed to go into the HTV. The ATV will fly within the proximity of the. space station to be caught by the space. station’s robotic arm before being berthed. the payload fairings would have to be modified from the current 5-meter to a 6-meter version to accommodate the larger diameter payloads to the space station during assembly missions.

Summary:
VA pays monthly disability compensation benefits to veterans with service-connected disabilities. VA also pays compensation to some spouses, children, and parents of deceased veterans and service members. VA made progress in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 reducing the size and age of its pending claims inventory, but it has lost ground since then. Questions remain about consistency of VA’s decisions across regional offices and at the Board of Veterans’ Appeals, the report says. The report says VA continues to experience significant service delivery challenges including lengthy processing times and inaccurate and inconsistent decisions. Fiscal year 2008 request would fund 8,320 full-time equivalent employees working on compensation and pension. VA identified an increase in claims processing staff as essential to reducing the pending claims inventory and improving timeliness. According to VA, with a workforce that is sufficiently large and correctly balanced, it can successfully meet the veterans’ needs while ensuring good stewardship of taxpayer funds. The budget justification would represent an increase of about 6 percent over fiscal year 2006. In addition to the budget justification, the VA would also seek to increase the number of contractors. cites near-term initiatives to increase the number of claims completed, such as using retired VA employees to provide training. VA expects a temporary decline in productivity as new staff are trained and become more experienced, but expects productivity to increase in the longer term. VA’s budget justification provides information on actual and planned productivity, in terms of claims decided per full-time equivalent employee. Also, VA has identified additional initiatives to help improve productivity. For example, the use of overtime is being increased. VA plans to pilot paperless Benefits Delivery at Discharge, where service members’ disability claim applications, service medical records, and other evidence would be captured electronically prior to discharge. VA expects that this new process will reduce the time needed to obtain the evidence needed to decide claims. To resolve appeals faster, VA has been working to reduce the number of appeals sent back by the Board of Veterans’ Appeals for further work such as obtaining additional evidence and correcting procedural errors. VA has established joint training and information sharing between field staff and the Board. VA reports that it has improved the productivity of the Board’s judges. The Board attributes this improvement to training and mentoring programs. To improve decision consistency, VA has contracted for a study of the major influences. The board expects productivity to improve to 752 decisions in fiscal year 2008. It expects to reduce the percentage of decisions remanded from about 57 percent in fiscalyear 2004 to about 32 percent in Fiscal Year 2006. It also expects to decrease the number of appeals decided from 604 appeals decided in fiscal 2003 to 698 in fiscal 2006. on compensation payments, to develop baseline data for monitoring and managing decision variances. VA is in the process of testing templates for compensation and pension medical examinations for specific types of disabilities. Further, VA formed a workgroup to study variances in the rates of benefit grants and denials, and in assigned disability evaluations. Despite these efforts, VA may be limited in its ability to make and sustain significant claims processing performance improvements, according to the report. The report was published by the RAND Corporation. VA attributes some of the increase in the number of claims pending and the average days pending to a September 2003 court decision that required over 62,000 claims to be processed. Since 1999, several court decisions and laws related to VA’s responsibilities to assist veterans in developing their benefit claims have significantly affected VA's ability to process claims in a timely manner. The VA is currently working on a plan to reduce the number and complexity of claims that need to be adjudicated. The plan is expected to be completed by the end of the year. be deferred, many for 90 days or longer. Legislation and VA regulations have expanded benefit entitlement and added to the volume of claims. VA expects additional claims receipts based on the enactment of legislation allowing certain military retirees to receive both military retirement pay and VA disability compensation. In addition, rating-related claims continue to increase, from about 579,000 in fiscal year 2000 to about 806,000In fiscal year 2006, an increase of more than 20 percent from 2000 to 2006. The VA says it expects to receive more than $1.2 billion in claims in the next fiscal year. of about 39 percent. VA projects relatively flat claim receipts in fiscal years 2007 and 2008. ongoing hostilities in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Global War on Terrorism in general, may increase the workload beyond current levels. VA has also noted that claims have increased in part because older veterans are filing disability claims for the first time. For example, some veterans are citing more disabilities in their claims than in the past. Because each disability needs to be evaluated separately, these claims can take longer to process. VA notes that they are receiving more disability claims, such as those related to mental health issues including post-traumatic stress disorder. Claims processing timeliness and decisional accuracy can be hampered if VA cannot obtain the evidence it needs in a timely manner. For example, to obtain information needed to fully develop some post- traumatic stress disorder claims, VBA must obtain records from the U.S. Army and Joint Services Records Research Center (JSRRC) This can significantly increase the time it takes to develop a claim. the time it takes to decide a claim. In December 2006, we recommended that VBA assess whether it could systematically utilize an electronic library of historical military records. VBA agreed to determine the feasibility of regional offices using an alternative resource prior to sending some requests to the JSRRC. We also reported that while VBA quality reviewers found few decision errors due to failure to obtain military service records, VBA does not know the extent to which the information that is provided to regional offices is reliable and accurate. rely on a VBA unit at the National Personnel Records Center to do thorough and reliable searches and analyses of records. Incomplete and inaccurate reports could affect decisional accuracy. VA is taking actions to address its claims processing challenges, but there are opportunities for more fundamental reform that could dramatically improve decision making and processing. These include reexamining program design, as well as the structure and division of labor. For more information, visit the VA's website or go to www.va.gov. among field offices. Research showed that the disability programs lagged behind the scientific advances and economic and social changes that have redefined the relationship between impairments and work. For example, advances in medicine and technology have reduced the severity of some medical conditions and have allowed individuals to live with greater independence and function in a more independent way. After more than a decade of research, we have determined that federal disability programs are in urgent need of attention and transformation and placed them on our high-risk list in January 2003. work settings. In August 2002, we recommended that VA use its annual performance plan to delineate strategies for and progress in periodically updating labor market data used in its disability determination. We found that these programs are poorly positioned to provide meaningful and timely support for Americans with disabilities. The nature of work has changed in recent decades as the national economy has moved away from manufacturing-based jobs to service- and knowledge- based employment. Yet VA’s and SSA's disability programs remain mired in concepts from the past. process. VA study and report to the Congress on the effects that a comprehensive consideration of medical treatment and assistive technologies would have on its disability programs’ eligibility criteria and benefits package. Study would include estimates of the effects on the size, cost, and management of VA’s disability programs and other relevant VA programs and would identify any legislative actions needed to initiate and fund such changes. Another area of program design that could be examined is the option of providing a lump sum payment in lieu of monthly disability compensation. Claims Adjudication Commission noted that most disability compensation claims are repeat claims. About 65 percent of veterans who began receiving disability compensation in fiscal year 2003 had disabilities rated 30 percent or less. The commission asked Congress to consider paying less severely disabled veterans compensation in a lump sum. According to the commission, the lump sum would be less than $1 million per veteran. For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or see www.samaritans.org for details. option could have a number of benefits for VA as well as veterans. The lump sum option could reduce the number of claims submitted and allow VA to process claims more quickly. In December 2000, we reported that about one-third of newly compensated veterans could be interested in a lump-sum option. In addition to program design, VA’s regional office claims processing structure may be disadvantageous to efficient operations. VBA and VBA are part of the Government Accountability Office, which publishes The Federalist. VA has not changed its basic field structure for processing compensation and pension claims at 57 regional offices. Unless more comprehensive and strategic changes are made to its field structure, VBA is likely to miss opportunities to substantially improve productivity, accuracy, and consistency. The Congress established the Veterans’ Disability Benefits Commission to study the appropriateness of VA disability benefits. The commission is scheduled to report to the Congress by October 1, 2007.

Summary:
The Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act of 1990 was passed in 1990. It requires colleges to publish and distribute an annual security report. The report includes statements about campus law enforcement policies, security education and crime prevention programs, alcohol and drug policies, sexual assault education and prevention programs. Two bills introduced in the 104th Congress would have required more detailed and current campus security records to be made accessible to the public, but no further action was taken before the session’s end. In 1996, no guidance for monitoring campus security was available until September 1996.

Summary:
The FSM and the RMI became sovereign nations in 1978 and 1979. In 1986, the United States and the two countries entered into the original Compact of Free Association. Economic development and self-sufficiency were not achieved under the original compact. U.S. assistance accounted for more than 50 percent of government revenues throughout the compact period. The United States negotiated separate amended compacts with the R MI and the FSM that went into effect on May 1, 2004, and June 25, 2004. The FSM and the RMI are established democracies with free and peaceful elections. Each country also has a vocal civil society evidenced by religious organizations and nongovernmental organizations (NGO) that have been active on some political issues. Both countries also participate in various regional organizations, many of which address trade, energy, and environmental challenges faced by islanders.both countries are in the bottom third for a key health indicator, immunizations. The FSM is ranked No. 1 in the world for immunizations, while The RMI is No. 2. The FSM and the RMI are members of the Forum Fisheries Agency and the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission. Despite the two countries’ stable democratic systems, key aspects of the FSM’s and RMI’S political environments hinder effective compact grant implementation. Lack of government consensus. Because each state has its own constitution, FSM's weak federal structure inhibits compact grant Implementation. Because the R MI has a strong constitution, it can be difficult to implement compact grants. Central government that is represented on JEMCO does not control the majority of compact funds. FSM access to the compact infrastructure grant, for example, has been delayed for more than 2 years owing to national and state disagreements over infrastructure priorities. RMI government and landowners on Kwajalein Atoll have been disputing government use of leased land and management of public entities on the atoll. Such tensions have negatively affected the construction of schools funded by the compact. The FSM government has been unable to secure agreement from the state governments regarding compact needs. compact grants and the management of the Kwajalein utility company. Lack of communication and dissemination of information by each government on wide-ranging issues. Private sector representatives in several FSM states reported that the public radio station serves as the government’s primary means of disseminating information but does not have a national radio station of its own. The U.S., FSM and RMI departmental officials, private sector representatives, NGOs, and external economic experts revealed a lack of communication. is often nonoperational or censored. The U.S. State Department’s 2004 Report on Human Rights Practices in the FSM. According to the World Bank, Transparency International, and other development experts, lack of information about government activities creates uncertainty for public, private, and community leaders. This uncertainty can inhibit grant performance, which can inhibit funding for development projects in the Marshall Islands. The government has been criticized for not holding public hearings or disseminating sufficient information regarding a proposed dry dock. The RMI and the FSM ranked 5th and 6th highest, respectively, with per capita aid greater than $900 in 2003. Much of this aid is directed toward health and education. MCC provides economic assistance to developing countries, with eligibility determined partially by evaluating a country’s performance—relative to other countries within its income group.and improvement of social and economic conditions. Although FSM and RMI health and. education expenditures are relatively high, certain conditions in both countries’ health. and education sectors are poor. with economic growth and poverty reduction. MCC ranks the FSM in the top 35 percent (in the 81st and 67th percentile) for expenditures on health and primary education. The FSM also performs relatively poorly in provision of safe water or immunizations. According to the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI), the F SMs also perform relatively well in providing safe water. The RMI also ranks relatively well for both indicators, relative to other lower-middle income countries that qualify for MCC assistance. Only 28 percent of FSM citizens have access to improved sanitation, according to WDI. In the RMI, the 1999 census suggests that 85 percent of the population has access to safe water. Recent tests in urban and rural areas indicate that a significant number of potable water sources, such as groundwater wells and water catchments, are contaminated and deemed unsafe for human consumption. (For further information on this issue, visit WDI’s World Health Organization website. For more information on FSM sanitation, visit the World Health Organisation website. socioeconomic conditions in the FSM and the RMI, particularly in relation to regional averages, refer to app. II. Country studies and health and education officials in the R MI and FSM also highlight other challenges. These include the increasing prevalence of lifestyle diseases such as diabetes or hypertension; youth health issues; and poor teaching skills. According to the F SM Department of Health, 80 percent of 35 to 64 year-olds are overweight. The number of cases involving diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and cancer increased in the late nineties. RMI has made progress in reducing overseas referrals since 2001. Rising prevalence of lifestyle diseases poses challenges for delivery of health services in both nations. Future health outlays will also be affected by health challenges facing FSM and RMI youths. FSM, RMI health officials indicated concern about growing youth problems such as suicides, sexually transmitted diseases, and teen pregnancy. The care and treatment of such diseases often involves expensive referrals abroad, lowered funding for public health programs that serve impoverished populations, and burdens on household and national budgets. With regard to teacher qualifications, the FSM Department of Education reports that 90 percent of teachers need to upgrade skills to meet new certification standards. In the RMI, a 2004 Ministry of Education assessment reported that more than 50 per cent of teachers had failed basic English literacy tests. The FSM and RMI economies have performed modestly and have been characterized by continued dependence on external assistance, suggests limited prospects for achieving development goals of budgetary self-reliance and long-term economic advancement. Private sector employment has largely stagnated. in both countries, whereas public sector expenditures continue to account for almost two-thirds of GDP. Unless each nation can secure other donor assistance, maintenance of living standards over the long term will likely require private sector expansion or increased remittances. The FSM and the RMI private sectors face significant constraints to growth, however, and emigrants’ current lack of marketable skills is a hurdle to increased remittance revenue. Although the amended compacts’ fiscal procedures’ Fiscal procedures. agreements require JEMCO and JEMFAC to monitor FSM and RMI progress toward budgetary self-reliance. Neither organization has discussed these issues at its annual meeting or defined what actions they will undertake to meet this requirement. In the FSM, 2004 and 2005 GDP fell owing to compact delays and a lower level of assistance relative to 2003. For the RMI, the IMF estimates that GDP expanded moderately owing to increased public sector expenditure (see the IMF report for details). Both countries’ 2005 public sector expenditure—about two-thirds of which is funded by external grants—remained at about 60 percent of GDP. In both the FSM and the RMI, however, private sector activity has remained relatively stagnant and exists largely to provide services to the public sector. Since 2000, the estimated private sector share of GDP has fallen in both countries and since 2000 in the F SM and RMI. In 2004, RMI public expenditure increased in both 2004 and 2005, reflecting expected compact funding. Only Pohnpei state in the FSM has had modest growth in private sector employment, principally in wholesale and retail operations. Given the recent performance and structure of FSM and RMI government budgets, both nations are likely to face significant budgetary pressure as compact grants decline through 2023. Apart from 2002 and 2003, when compact assistance was temporarily increased, FSM national and state budgets have varied. The private sector is isolated from international opportunities, given each economy’s high dependence on imports and negligible foreign investment. widely from year to year; however, each has had recent budget deficits. RMI government finance statistics reported by the IMF suggest that the RMI fiscal balance deteriorated after 2003 as well. Economic experts emphasize that, structurally, both country’s budgets are characterized by a small local revenue base and recent increases in government payroll. As a result, unless other donors provide additional assistance, expenditure reductions will be required as compact grants decline. Although tax revenue in the FSM increased slightly in 2005, the F SM tax base increased slightly. is small and the growing wage bill is high relative to regional standards. In 2005, FSM taxes provided an estimated $29 million in revenue, or 23 percent of total revenue. The largest income source is external grants, which, at $76 million, accounted for 60 percent of revenues in 2005. In terms of expenditure, the largest FSM expenditure component is public sector wages and salaries at an average of $1.2 billion. The FSM government receives fishing access fees from foreign vessels that fish in its exclusive economic zone. estimated $60 million. Taxes in the RMI provide about $22 million in revenue to the government, or roughly 26 percent of total revenues (see fig. 6). The RMI also receives fishing access fees. At 64, the FSM's population is about the same as that of the U.S. and Canada. The FSM’s public sector wage bill is also relatively smaller, although its wage bill increases have exceeded the F SM’S. The R MI has a population of about 64,000, compared with about 60,000 for the FMC. percent of total revenues, external grants are the largest income component, providing $54 million in 2005. The structure of RMI revenues remained roughly the same over the past 5 years. RMI payroll expenditures increased. In 2005, the RMI’s wage bill comprised 34 percent of total expenditures, compared with the 2000 to 2004 wage bill of 31 percent. In addition to receiving compact grant assistance, the FSM and RMI receive substantial U.S. program assistance from agencies such as the United States. As compact grants decline through 2023, government fiscal balances and GDP could be supported, at least partially, by increased noncompact assistance. However, such increases in assistance are not guaranteed, may vary from year to year, and may not be flexible enough to meet FSM and RMI budget needs. Tax reform may provide opportunities for increasing annual government revenue in the FSM, RMI, and China. The U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Education, and Health and Human Services provide assistance to the RMI and FSM. Business tax schemes in both nations are considered to be inefficient by the IMF, the ADB, and other economic experts. Various expert and country studies have concluded that substantial tax reform could bring revenue growth. However, although the FSM and the RMI governments have made some improvement in tax administration, tax revenues have largely stagnated. Revenue potential from further tax reform will also vary by government (national and local) and country (FSM and RMI) The FSM is a member of the European Union. The RMI is part of the Eurozone. Fishing and tourism are key potential growth industries. In the FSM, the fisheries and tourism sectors together provide about 6 percent of employment. In both nations, fishing enterprises have shown poor performance, and the number of tourists has been small relative to other Pacific islands. Commercial fishing has been plagued by poor government investments in vessels and infrastructure that have resulted in high debt levels, according to the RMI development plans. The development plans will require factors such as a sound design; adequate resources and capacity for tax enforcement; government commitment for reform. ADB experts; and visitor arrivals have remained flat over the past 10 years despite growth in Pacific island tourism. In the RMI, the fisheries and tourism sectors together provide less than 5 percent of employment. Economic experts suggest that the FSM and RMI fishing and tourism industries could grow within specialized niche markets such as high-end tourism or dock services. Such opportunities remain limited in scale, however, and the IMF, IMF, and ADB say they are not likely to grow on a large scale. the ADB and other economic experts suggest that growth in these industries in both countries may be limited by current structural barriers. geographic isolation and small fragmented markets; high airfares and poor flight connections; lack of adequate hotel and airport infrastructure. low freight capacities and poor interisland shipping; inadequate transshipment facilities in some areas. growing threat of overfishing; limited pool of skilled labor; and high production costs in terms of labor, fuel, and other supplies. In addition to facing structural barriers to growth, private industry in general faces a costly business environment in both the United States and China. FSM and the RMI according to economic experts and U.S. and country officials. In interviews, private sector representatives also expressed concern with poor government provision of power, water, and infrastructure services. FSM and RMI emigrants could provide increasing monetary support to their home nations in the future, although evidence suggests that they are less likely to do so now than in the past. The FSM Department of Economic Affairs could provide more information on how to send emigrants back to the United States. World Bank data show that remittances have become an important source of financial flows to developing countries. For the FSM and the RMI, many citizens have taken advantage of U.S. migration rights established by the original compact and extended by the amended compacts. As of 2005, RMI data suggest that about 15,000 Marshallese have immigrated to the United States. FSM data suggests that almost twice as many Micronesians live in the U.K. than in the Marshall Islands. The current level of remittance income provided by these emigrants is unknown. In the RMI, the 2002 household survey suggests that RMI citizens send more money out to RMI emigrants than they receive in remittances. This is owing to the emigrants’ lack of high-paying jobs and inability to afford repatriation of funds. The 2003 U.S. census of FSM and RMI migrants in Hawaii, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands (CNMI) confirms this characterization. showing that almost half of the emigrants live below the poverty line (see table 3). Economic experts emphasize that with an upgrading of skills, the FSM’s and the RMI’'s free access and strong historical links to the U.S. market create potential for the two nations to achieve an expansion in remittance income. To date, JEMCO and JEMFAC have not discussed FSM and RMI progress toward budgetary self-reliance and long-term economic advancement. of increased private sector development, strengthened education and training, and improved public sector management as means of achieving the goals of budgetary self-reliance and long-term economic growth. The amended compacts’ fiscal procedures agreements requires the JEMCO and JEMFAC to monitor FSM and RMI progress. The oversight committees have not defined what actions they will undertake to meet this requirement. At the fiscal year 2004 and 2005 annual JEMco and J EMFAC meetings, the management committees focused on approving sector grants and discussing grant administration issues. example, to approve the FSM health and education sector grants, JEMCO has required supplementary information on health insurance programs. The JEMco meetings have not included discussion of FSM progress toward its long-term development goals. At the 2005 JEMFAC meeting, the RMI government provided a brief overview of GDP and employment data, yet the presenting official reported that there was no meaningful JEMfAC discussion of RMI long- term growth issues. For example, while the R MI government presented data on migration to the United States, JEMFAC did not discuss the linkage between compact education spending and improving RMI emigrant’s skills to encourage increased remittance income over the long-term. FSM and RMI officials report that they have implemented a few legislation actions to improve the private sector environment. Despite several years of policy dialogue on taxes, the FSM has agreed on elements of tax reform but has no plan for implementation and the RMI has not agreed on structural change to its tax system. Despite amendments to foreign investment regulations, the regulations in both countries continue to be confusing and relatively burdensome. In 2005, the FSM Task Force on Tax Reform developed a tax reform proposal. Such reforms are estimated to require 2 to 3 years for implementation. The FSM government has neither begun to implement the proposal nor specified an implementation plan. The RMI government and economic experts have recognized for several years that the RMI needs to reform its tax system to become more competitive and competitive with the U.S. and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. For more information, go to: www.rsm.org. tax system is complex and regressive, taxing on a gross rather than net basis and having weak collection and administration capacity. Private sector representatives’ most common complaint on the RMI tax system is the need for better and tighter enforcement. The RMI Office of Tax and Revenue reported that it has focused on improving tax administration and has raised some penalties and tax levels. Legislation for income tax reform has failed and needed changes in government import tax exemptions have not yet been addressed. Inadequate access to land. Land tenure systems in each nation are complex and based on traditional and customary rights, often for multiple individuals. Most parcels do not have a registered, legal title. Land values are also uncertain owing to the lack of a developed land market or price data on land in the FSM and RMI. Our interviews with F SM and R MI officials and private sector representatives suggested that costly boundary disputes are common. We are happy to clarify these issues with the help of our expert team of land experts. lease transactions, such that banks are unable to effectively conduct mortgage secured lending. Foreigners are prohibited from owning land in both nations and are also unable to secure a valid lease when land values or ownership is uncertain. Land reform issues have been discussed in the FSM and the RMI for several years, and land registration has been discussed as part of the plan to reform the two nations' economies. Using land for foreign investment is even more difficult, according to experts in the two countries. The inability to use it to secure financing for development is problematic, they say. offices have been established. Such offices have lacked a systematic method for registering parcels, instead waiting for landowners to voluntarily initiate the process. Landowners have shown little interest in land registration, partly owing to the cultural issues associated with traditional land ownership structures. The functionality of land registration offices in both the FSM and the RMI has also been limited by a lack of registered surveyors and trained surveyors. Only 5 parcels have been, or are currently being, registered by the land registration office. The FSM and the RMI have amended various aspects of their foreign investment laws to streamline the process. In the FSM, experts report that foreign investment regulations vary between states, creating confusion and additional requirements for investors who want to invest in several states. The overall climate for foreign investment remains complex and nontransparent, according to economic experts and private sector representatives. According to an Interior official, a shipping company with service from the U.S. has been banned from operating in the country. the U.S. West Coast to Guam has for years been seeking permission to provide shipping service to the FSM and the RMI. The climate for foreign investment is also reportedly affected by private and public interests’ protecting local businesses from foreign competition. Some FSM states require a certain percentage of local ownership in foreign investment. Pohnpei state, for instance, requires 30 percent local ownership forforeign investment and prohibits foreign activity. The FSM state of Pohnpei also requires foreign investment to be made through a local company. in retail, according to its Foreign Investment Board. Interviews with country officials, private sector representatives, and an ADB expert also suggest that local businesses sometimes lobby the foreign investment boards against approval of certain applications. Extensive FSM and RMI government involvement in commercial activities continues to hinder private sector development, owing to high public sector wages and government enterprises that directly compete with private industry. The FSM’s and the RMI’S public sector reform efforts since the 1990s have been based on restructuring government operations to reduce the size and cost of the civil service. market-oriented enterprises that could be more efficiently operated by the private sector. (3) improve government provision of critical support services. One example of a reform success highlighted by economic experts is the RMI’s restructuring of its Social Security Administration to reduce operating costs and improve service provision. However, despite government endorsement of public sector reform principles, early efforts to reduce public sector employment have generally failed in both the FSM and the R MI. F SM and RMI public sector wages also remain about twice the level. of private sector wages, contributing to the large government wage bill and effectively drawing the most skilled employees out of the private sector into public sector jobs. In addition, the FSM and the RMI governments continue to conduct a wide array of commercial enterprises that compete with private enterprises. Although the share of employment accounted for by these enterprises, as well as estimated direct public enterprise subsidies, has declined in recent years, IMF and ADB officials expressed concern that they are not committed to reducing their participation in commercial activities. the fact that most of the enterprises have drained public finances through poor financial performance, requiring subsidization or entailing debt (see examples in table 4). In conjunction with the ADB, the FSM prepared a comprehensive program for public sector enterprise reform in 1999 that identified two enterprises per state and national government for privatization. Such privatizations later became a condition for receiving ADB loan assistance. This unit has not yet been fully staffed, and theADB loan requirement was reduced to one enterprise per state or national government. The RMI has yet to prepare a comprehensive policy for public enterprise reform. The legislation implementing the amended compacts specifically directs the JEMCO and JEMFAC to address FSM and RMI progress. To date, JEMco and J EMFAC have not addressed the lack of F SMM and R MI progress in implementing reforms that their development plans specify are needed to stimulate investment and improve tax income. The RMI is planning to privatize some public enterprises, they intend to expand others. The FSM and the RMI face notable challenges to achieving budgetary self- reliance and long-term economic advancement. Tax, land, foreign investment regulation and public-sector reforms, when implemented, will improve the business environment, in turn facilitating the private sector expansion that may help the countries advance their compact goals. The scheduled coming reductions in U.S. grants to both countries create urgency for the implementation of policy reforms if they require fiscal resources. We recommend that the Secretary of the Interior direct the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Insular Affairs, as Chairman of JEMCO and JEMFAC, to ensure that they fulfill their requirements. The RMI advocated for JEMFAC support in policy reform implementation. The Department of Interior concurred with our recommendation. The RMI emphasized that public sector reforms are particularly vital. HHS also requested that it be expanded to include JEMCO and J EMFAC requirements for establishing timelines for policy reform.be found in appendixes IV through VII. We also received technical comments from Interior, State, Treasury, HHS and the RMI. We incorporated technical comments into our report, as appropriate. Interior, HHS, and the FSM emphasized that the JEMCO and JEMFAC have thus far focused their attention on accountability issues and problems that have arisen within the various sector grants. HHS suggested that, in order to ensure the Jemco and J EMFAC can address all pertinent short-term and long- term issues, establishing timelines is one method to improve U.S. assistance in support of an improved FSM and RMI environment for investment and tax income. mechanisms to improve communication and information between annual meetings. periodic teleconferences and videoconferences should be pursued. The FSM viewed the report as a potentially constructive contribution to ongoing efforts to pursue budgetary self-reliance and economic advancement. We disagreed with our conclusion that FSM development prospects remain limited. We will provide copies of this report to your offices, as well as the Secretaries of the Interior, State, and Health and Human Services, and the President of the Federated States of Micronesia. of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. We will make copies available to other interested parties upon request. If you or your staff have any questions regarding this report, please contact me at (202) 512-3149 or gootnickd@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made major contributions to this report are listed in appendix VIII. The amended compacts implementing legislation requires that we report on political, social, and economic conditions in the Federated States of Micronesia. Islands (RMI) as well as the use and oversight of U.S. assistance to those nations. This report examines each country’s political and social environment for compact grant implementation. It also examines economic conditions, including overall growth, fiscal balances, and private investment; and status of economic policy reforms. To identify key aspects of the FSM and the RMI political andsocial environment for Compact grant implementation, we reviewed the U.s., FSM, and RMI annual compact reports for 2004. We identified key areas of concern in delivery of health and education services. We obtained FSM and RMI socioeconomic statistics on noncommunicable diseases, access to safe water and sanitation, teacher certifications and literacy skills. We also obtained Pacific Island Literacy Level student test scores from the Pacific Islands Forum. We looked at development plans and reports prepared in conjunction with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World Bank, or the U.N. Development Program. The report was compiled by Transparency International and the University of Hawaii. FSM Departments of Health and Education and the RMI Ministries of health and Education. We obtained regional socioeconomic statistics on population trends, teenage fertility, child mortality rates, immunizations, human poverty, and GDP and aid per capita. We reviewed the U.S., FSM, and RMI annual compact reports for 2004; FSM and R MI development plans; recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) Article IV documents for each nation; ADB Country Strategies and Program Updates. RMI Pacific Island Economic Reports (PIER) prepared in conjunction with the ADB; and expert reviews of FSM and RMI fiscal structures and tax systems. We obtained data on gross domestic product (GDP), employment, government finances, migration, and private sector development from the IMF, OECD, and World Bank. To describe the status of economic policy reforms in the F SM and the RMI, we reviewed the documents mentioned in the PIER and ADB reports. We also reviewed the OECD’s international development statistics and the U.S. Department of Census. We obtained data on FSM and RMI public sector enterprises from the FSM’s 2005 Statistical Tables and the RMI’S 2004 Annual Yearbook. In addition, we held extensive interviews with officials from the U.S. Department of the Interior (Washington, D.C., Honolulu; the F SMM; and R MI. We also obtained data from the most recent available public enterprise audit reports and ADB progress reports on the R MI Private Sector Development Project and FSM Private sector Development Loan. We traveled to all four states in the FSM and to the RMI (Majuro) We had detailed discussions with the governor’s and legislature's offices in each of the states. We also interviewed officials from the ADB (Manila, the Philippines), the IMF (Washington, D.C.) and the Pacific Islands Development Program at the East-West Center (Honolulu) The U.S. Department of State, Treasury and Health and Human Services were also interviewed. with FSM (national and state governments) and RMI officials from foreign affairs, finance and budget, economic affairs, health, education, land management, tourism and fisheries. In each location, we also met with numerous representatives from private sector businesses, banks, and community organizations. We asked experts at the ADB, the IMF, the World Bank, the Boston Institute of Development Economics, and the University of Hawaii’s East-West Center with knowledge of the FSM and the RMI economies. provide a technical review of our findings and information on the reliability of data used to support those findings. In conjunction with our own assessment, we determined that trade data, remittance data, and data on the private sector profits contained weaknesses. Exact data for these elements were not presented in the report and related findings were corroborated with other reliable data. Nonetheless, our interviews with U.S., country, and international officials revealed important constraints to the FSM's and the RMI’s capacity to improve their economies. prepare regular, reliable, and complete data that would allow for a more thorough analysis of social and economic trends. Trend data on a variety of social indicators, such as teacher qualifications and student drop-outs, could assist in evaluation of the effectiveness of compact education assistance. However, much of this data are just now being collected in a systematic way. Also, given that both nations have weak domestic capacity to produce statistics, they rely heavily on external consultants for this purpose. In the FSM, the contract for statistical assistance from external consultants has now expired. both FSM and Interior officials have expressed concern for that nations’ capacity to produce future statistics. We conducted our review from August 2005 through March 2006 in accordance with generally accepted U.S. government auditing standards. We requested written comments on a draft of this report from the Departments of the Interior, State, Health and Human Services, and Treasury. All comments are discussed in the report and are reprinted in appendixes IV through VII. Further, we considered all comments and made changes to the report, as appropriate. small island economies suggest common challenges for socioeconomic development. Developing nations in the Pacific have exhibited relatively poor economic performance. Such nations have also exhibited the need for improvements in delivery of health and education services. Environmental challenges from climate change and increasing population density are also common threats to ensuring sustainable livelihoods in thePacific. Table 5 provides estimated socioeconomic data on various Pacific island nations in. The report was published by the International Development Association (IDA) and the World Economic Forum (WEF) on November 14, 2013. Both the RMI and the FSM have a relatively large population density at 331 and 181 people per square kilometer, respectively. The RMI also has a very high teenage fertility rate. Except for Palau, both nations have the highest levels of aid per capita. The FSM’s child mortality rates are significantly lower than the R MI’S. The U.S. has a Compact of Free Association with the United States with which the F SM shares a border. immunization rates are significantly higher. The RMI provides a significantly higher proportion of the population access to improved sanitation. Private sector representatives in the FSM and the RMI characterized the business environment in their nation as obstructive and costly. They attribute this characterization to elements of the political environment (e.g., poor information), lack of progress in economic reforms (both legal and financial), and poor government performance in providing services. World Bank national business environment surveys suggest that a high cost of doing business is a common problem for small island states. business environments are particularly costly in several areas. For example, of 155 countries surveyed, the FSM and the RMI are among the worst 10 to 20 countries in terms of the cost of enforcing contracts and the degree of investor protection. In interviews with private sector representatives, problems were noted with F SM and RMI business environments (see fig. 7). The following are GAO’s comments on the Department of the Interior letter dated May 16, 2006. Regarding our finding that compact management committees have not discussed F SMs and R MI progress toward budgetary self-reliance and long-term economic advancement at their annual meeting. meetings, we recognize that the Deputy Assistant Secretary submitted a statement for the record at the opening of the 2005 JEMCO meeting that mentioned the lack of sustainability in the FSM’s economic dependence on government expenditures. The issue of FSM progress toward their long-term development goals was not discussed by the JEMco. We recognize that Interior has contracted with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’S Graduate School to obtain further economic information on the F SM and the RMI. GAO: We believe sufficient information is available for the committees to begin meeting their requirement to evaluate FSM and RMI progress in implementing reforms. HHS agreed with our recommendation and requested the information. GAO’s comment on the Department of Health and Human Services letter dated May 23, 2006, is published in the May 2006 issue of the GAO magazine, “Foreign Policy in the Middle East and North Africa.” It is also available online at: http://www.gao.org/. that it be expanded to include JEMCO and JEMFAC requirements for establishing policy reform implementation timelines. As noted in our conclusions and by HHS, the urgency of pursuing policy reform suggests that establishing timelines for such reforms could be a useful method to improve U.S. assistance. We also appreciate that the JEMco and J EMFAC should consider this suggestion. The amended compacts’ U.N. implementing legislation does not include establishing timelines. for policy as a specific required action for the J EMCO andJEMFac. HHS’s suggestion to improve communication and information between annual meetings through periodic teleconferences and videoconferences and have added language to the report to reflect this suggestion. The Federated States of Micronesia confirms the accuracy of our description of its recent economic performance, its constraints to growth, and its need for economic policy reforms. We maintain that given these current realities, we maintain that the FSM's development prospects remain limited. We have also added language in the report recognizing HHS's efforts to improve vaccine coverage. Prospects for long-term economic growth in the FSM remain limited. If key policy reforms were implemented, the business environment would likely improve and facilitate private sector expansion. The FSM will also likely need to identify and capitalize on niche market opportunities as well as to create conditions to maximize remittance income. The education and health of its citizens should be improved, particularly through improving the education, health and safety of citizens. The country should also focus on the development of its infrastructure and infrastructure. connections with the overseas business community may be one way to pursue such opportunities and should be included in meaningful JEMCO discussions. The coming reductions in U.S. grants, paired with current economic realities, also suggests the need for frank assessments of current limited prospects for economic growth in the FSM and what actions need to be pursued to improve those. As we emphasized earlier, the scheduled coming reductions of U.N. grants creates urgency for implementation of policy reforms and for capitalizing on opportunities to leverage compact assistance. GAO: Economic reforms in each of the areas discussed are needed to improve the RMI’s prospects for long-term economic growth. We also agree that the annual decrement in compact grant funding is a major challenge to achieving this objective, particularly if implementation of key policy reforms requires fiscal resources. We recognize that the FSM and RMI were required under the Compact of Free Association to make changes to the Marshall Islands’ tax system. We have clarified the report language to reflect these changes. amended compacts to contribute an initial $30 million to their trust funds. Recent RMI GDP performance may have differed if this funding were used to provide current goods and services rather than for savings. The RMI allocated no compact funding to a public sector capacity building grant in fiscal year 2004 and less than 1 percent of compact sector grant funding to such a grant in 2005. The effectiveness of U.S. and ADB technical assistance to the RMI is outside the scope of this report. The RMI estimates that between 500 to 800 new job entrants will need to find employment each year from 1999 to 2009. To meet this objective, the ready access provided under the compact for Marshallese to live and work in the U.S. must be preserved. Economic experts have emphasized that the RMI’s free education system needs to be improved to help Marshallese succeed both in the R MI and abroad. The JEMFAC may consider when discussing compact grant implementation that Marshallese should have access to free education. access and strong historical links to the U.S. market provide the RMI with relatively good opportunities to expand remittance income. Improved skill provision should benefit both RMI emigrants as well as domestic economic prospects. We have clarified our reference that 2003 data on international visitor arrivals are for other Pacific island nations. Such data are not available for Kiribati and Nauru. The World Bank has estimated that, in 2002, KirIBati had 5,000 international visitors. However, Kiribiti also has a per capita GDP that is less than one-third of the R MI’s. data indicate that the RMI did succeed in reducing public sector employment from about 3,760 jobs in 1997 to 3,530 jobs in 2001. We have modified language in the report to clarify each of these points. The report has added language to include the volatility in tax income from the fisheries and tourism sectors and the fact that RMI offices related to reform efforts, such as land registration offices, have been funded with compact grants.

Summary:
The department is facing near and long-term internal fiscal pressures. For more than a decade, DOD has dominated GAO’s list of federal programs and operations at high risk of being vulnerable to fraud, waste, abuse. All of the DOD programs on the High-Risk List relate to business operations, including systems and processes related to management of contracts, finances, the supply chain, and other areas of the agency's operations. The department is trying to balance competing demands to support ongoing operations, rebuild readiness following extended military operations, and manage increasing personnel and health care costs. support infrastructure, as well as weapon systems acquisition. Long-standing and pervasive weaknesses in DOD’s financial management and related business processes and systems have left the department vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse. Because of the complexity and long-term nature of DOD's transformation efforts, GAO has reported the need for a new system to manage the department's finances and operations. The department has reported that it is in need of a new financial management system to monitor the financial status and cost of DOD activities. chief management officer (CMO) position and a comprehensive, enterprisewide business transformation plan. In May 2007, DOD designated the Deputy Secretary of Defense as the CMO. DOD financial managers are responsible for the functions of budgeting, financing, accounting for transactions and events, and reporting of financial and other activities. In addition, the National Defense Authorization Acts for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 contained provisions that codified the C MO and Deputy Chief Management Officer (DCMO) positions. Before 1991, the military services and defense agencies independently managed their finance and accounting operations. According to DOD, these decentralized operations were highly inefficient and failed to produce reliable information. On November 26, 1990, DOD created the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) DFAS is DOD’s accounting agency to consolidate, standardize, and integrate finance and Accounting requirements, functions, procedures, operations, and systems. The military services play a vital role in that they authorize the expenditure of funds and are the source of most of the financial information. GAO: DOD financial management was designated as a high-risk area by GAO in 1995. Pervasive deficiencies in financial management processes, systems, and controls, continue to impair management’s ability to assess the resources needed for DOD operations, says GAO. Other business operations, including the high- risk areas of contract management, supply chain management, support infrastructure management, and weapon systems acquisition are directly impacted by the problems in financialmanagement, it says. The problems continue to persist, resulting in billions of dollars of wasted resources, reduced efficiency, and inadequate accountability. GAO: DOD has made significant improvements to the FIAR Plan that, if implemented effectively, could result in significant improvement in DOD’s financial management and progress toward auditability. But progress in taking corrective actions and resolving deficiencies remains slow. DOD Comptroller directed the departments of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force and the Defense Logistics Agency to use a standard process and aggressively modify their activities to support and emphasize achievement of the priorities. The consistent application of a standard methodology can help establish a standard baselines for assessing the components’ current financial management capabilities. to accounting and financial reporting and information technology systems were fully implemented. DOD Inspector General auditors told us that tests performed during the Marine Corps’ fiscal year 2011 SBR audit effort will determine whether and to what extent the problems identified during the fiscal year 2010 audit effort have been resolved. They also confirmed that as of August 25, 2011, the Corps had remediated the problems on 11 of the information technology audit recommendations. Because of the department’s complexity and magnitude, developing and developing and testing systems is difficult. implementing a comprehensive plan that identifies DOD’s internal control weaknesses will not be an easy task. It is a task that is critical to resolving the long-standing weaknesses and will require consistent management oversight and monitoring for it to be successful. Effective financial management in DOD will require a knowledgeable and skilled workforce that includes individuals who are trained and certified in accounting, well versed in government accounting practices and standards. Hiring and retaining such a skilled workforce is a challenge DOD must meet to succeed in its transformation. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 directed DOD to develop a strategic plan to shape and improve the department’s civilian workforce. The plan was to, among other things; include assessments of (1) existing critical skills and competencies in DOD's civilian workforce, and (2) future critical skills needed over the next decade. In addition, DOD was to submit a plan of action for dev eloping and reshaping the civilian employee workforce to address any identified gaps, according to the report. as well as specific recruiting and retention goals and strategies on how to train, compensate, and motivate civilian employees. In developi the plan, the department identified financial management as one of its enterprisewide mission-critical occupations. Although some aspects of the legislative requirements were addressed, DOD still has significant work to do. For example, while the plan included gap analyses related to the number of personnel needed for some of the mission- critical occupations, the plan did not address the number needed for others. department had only discussed competency gap analyses for 3 mission-critical occupations. Financial management was not included in the department’s analysis. Until DOD analyzes personnel needs and gaps in the financial management area, it will not be in a position to develop an effective financial management recruitment, retention, and investment strategy. The department established a governance structure for the FIAR Plan, which includes review bodies for governance and oversight. The governance structure is intended to provide the vision and oversight for the plan. necessary to align financial improvement and audit readiness efforts across the department. To monitor progress and hold individuals accountable for progress, DOD managers and oversight bodies need reliable, valid, meaningful metrics to measure performance and the results of corrective actions. In May 2009, we reported that the FIAR Plan did not have clear results-oriented metrics. The DOD and the components have established senior executive committees as well as designated officials at the appropriate levels to monitor and oversee their financial improvement efforts. These committees and individuals have also generally been assigned appropriate roles and responsibilities. metrics. DOD has taken action to begin defining results-oriented FIAR metrics. We have not yet had an opportunity to assess implementation of these metrics. Ensuring effective monitoring and oversight of progress will be key to bringing about effective implementation, through the components’ FIPs. However, as noted in our recent report, the components' control over the accuracy of supporting data is a key concern for us. We will continue to monitor the progress made by the components and provide updates as necessary. we found that weaknesses in the Navy and Air Force FIAR Plan implementation efforts indicate that the monitoring and oversight of such efforts have not been effective. More specifically, we found that component officials as well as the oversight committees at both the component and DOD levels did not effectively carry out their monitoring responsibilities. For the two FIPs that we reviewed, neither individual officials nor the executive committees took sufficient action to ensure that the Fips were accurate or complied with the FIAR Guidance. As a result, the Navy concluded that its Civilian Pay was ready for audit, as did the Air Force with respect to its Military Equipment. The DOD Comptroller concluded that neither of these FIPs supported audit readiness. DOD continues to take steps to comply with the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005. The implementation of an integrated, audit-ready systems environment underlies all of DOD’s financial improvement efforts and is crucial to achieving departmentwide audit readiness, the report says. DOD has identified 10 ERPs as essential to its efforts to transform its business operations. We are reviewing the status of two of these ERPs, the Army’s General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS) and the Air Force's Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) GFEBS is expected to be fully deployed during fiscal year 2012, is currently operational at 154 locations, including DFAS, and is being used by approximately 35,000 users. DEAMS is intended to provide the. Air Force with the entire spectrum of financial management capabilities and is expected. to maintain control and accountability for approximately $160 billion. The department is heading in the right direction and making progress, says GAO. Some of the most difficult challenges ahead lie in the effective implementation of the department’s strategy. GAO will continue to monitor the progress of and provide feedback on the status of DOD’S financial management efforts, the report says. The department and its military components are fully auditable, and DOD financial management is no longer considered high risk, says the report. The report says the department is making progress and is committed to improving its financial management. financial management improvement efforts. We currently have work in progress to assess implementation of the department’s FIAR strategy and efforts toward auditability. I would be pleased to respond to any questions that you or other members of the Subcommittee may have at this time. For further information regarding this testimony, please contact Asif A. Khan, (202) 512-9869 or khana@gao.gov. For more information on this hearing, please visit the GSA's website at: http://www.gsa.gov/. The first three waves focus on achieving the DOD Comptroller’s interim budgetary and asset accountability priorities, while the remaining two waves are intended to complete actions needed to achieve full financial statement auditability. Each wave focuses on assessing and strengthening internal controls and business systems. The department has not yet fully defined its strategy for completing waves 4 and 5. The next wave is expected to be completed by the end of the year. The Department of Defense is the largest taxpayer in the U.S., with a budget of more than $1 trillion. related to the stage of auditability addressed in the wave. Wave 1 focuses on the appropriations receipt and distribution process. Wave 2 focuses on supporting the budget-related data used for management decision making and reporting, including the Statement of Budgetary Resources. In addition to fund balance with Treasury reporting and reconciliation, other significant end-to-end business processes in this wave include budgeting, apportionment and sub-allotment activity within the department. For more information, go to: http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/29/government/audit/index.html#storylink=cpy. Mission Critical Assets Existence and Completeness Audit focuses on ensuring that all assets that are recorded in the department’s accountable property systems of record exist. Wave 4—Full Audit Except for Legacy Asset Valuation includes the valuation assertion over new asset acquisitions and validation of management's assertion regarding new asset acquisition.include procure-to-pay, hire- to-retire, order-to-$ cash, and budget-to report. The mission critical assets audit is designed to ensure the department's assets are consistently categorized, summarized, and reported. new asset acquisitions, and it depends on remediation of the existence and completeness assertions in Wave 3. proper contract structure for cost accumulation and cost accounting data must be in place prior to completion of the valuation assertion for new acquisitions. It involves the budgetary transactions covered by the Statement of Budgetary Resources effort in Wave 2. Wave 5—Full Financial Statement Audit focuses efforts on assessing and strengthening, as necessary, internal controls, processes, and business systems involved in supporting the valuations reported for legacy assets. to ensure control over the valuation of new assets acquired. The existence and completeness of all mission assets are deemed effective on a go-forward basis. Given the lack of documentation to support the values of the department’s legacy assets, federal accounting standards allow for the use of alternative methods to provide reasonable estimates for the cost of these assets. The dual focus on budgetary and asset information offers the potential to obtain preliminary assessments regarding the effectiveness of current processes and controls and identify potential issues that may adversely impact subsequent waves.

Summary:
Since 2007, the Federal Highway Administration has amended certain national standards for traffic signs. Some state and local agencies complained that the new standards would be relatively costly to comply with. In response to the criticism, FHWA eliminated some of the nighttime visibility maintenance standard compliance deadlines. Nighttime crash rates are estimated to be three times higher than daytime rates, and the fatality rate for nighttime driving is also higher than for daytime driving. At night, when visual cues available to drivers are much more limited, the assistance provided by traffic signs becomes more important.

Summary:
The Volcker Rule prohibits banks from engaging in risky, short-term, speculative trading and investing in private equity and hedge funds. These are practices long condemned by the Rule's namesake, former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker. Congress has delegated extensive discretion to the federal financial regulators to craft the Rule to meet a list of widely divergent objectives, the authors say. The rule applies to community and global banks, every variety of insurance firm, securities firms, and foreign banking institutions operating in the United States. The Volcker Rule's restrictions applies to "banking entities" "Banking entity" is defined as FDIC-insured depository institutions. The rule applies to the approximately 10,000 "community banks" scattered across the country. It also applies to global financial conglomerates like Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs, which are organized as FHCs and thus control at least one depository institution. The rules likely will modify and clarify the requirements through regulations and guidance. "banking entity," as discussed below. Because they may engage in little or no activities that are banned by the Volcker Rule, the recordkeeping and reporting requirements and other compliance standards that apply to community banks and their subsidiaries and affiliates generally will not be as onerous as those imposed on the country's largest FHCs. As another example, foreign banks and foreign affiliates of U.S. banking entities may not be subject to the same recordkeeping requirements as their American-based counterparts. The Volcker Rule establishes an outright prohibition on proprietary trading by a "banking entity" Subsequent provisions of the legislation provide activities that are excluded from the definition of "proprietary trading" The exact language provides a broad prohibition. It reads, "a banking entity shall not … engage in proprietary trading,” but there are exceptions to the general ban as long as various conditions are met.under certain circumstances will be permitted to trade foreign government obligations, but these activities generally are prohibited. Under the statute, "proprietary trading" covers buying and selling of "financial instruments" by banking entities as "principal" for their "trading accounts" "Financial instruments" include securities, derivatives, and contracts for future sale or for options on any commodity other than foreign exchange or currency, but not loans. The regulation focuses on restricting short-term trades. It establishes a rebuttable presumption that any financial instrument held for fewer than 60 days is a banned proprietary trade unless all relevant facts and circumstances rebut the presumption. "Trading account" also covers trades by banking entities that are securities dealers and swap or swap-based securities dealers. The Rule, embodied in the regulations, expressly provides that certain activities are not included in the trading account category. The trading account is used to buy or sell one or more financial instruments "principally" for "short-term resale," to benefit from " short-term price movements," or to hedge any of these. It also covers market risk capital transactions and hedges. in the definition of "proprietary trading," including the following: acquisitions or sales of financial products pursuant to a repurchase and reverse repurchase agreement. "highly liquid" securities as part of a valid liquidity management plan, which "the banking entity does not reasonably expect to give rise to appreciable profits or losses" as a result of short-term price movements. "Derivative clearing activities," such as in connection with a judicial or administrative proceeding, are also included in the definition. The rule lists permitted activities and sets conditions under which those activities may be conducted. The ban on proprietary trading does not apply to a banking entity's underwriting activities. The regulation's requirements include that the amount, types, and risks of the financial instruments are designed not to exceed, on an ongoing basis, the reasonably expected near term demands of clients, customers, or counterparties. The regulators may impose additional capital and quantitative limits as "appropriate to protect the safety and soundness of banking entities engaged in such activities" The Volcker Rule defines "covered fund" to largely encompass entities that are exempt from various registration requirements with either the SEC or CFTC. The rule explicitly excludes a number of activities and products from the " covered fund" definition. In addition to outright exclusions, certain activities that would fall under the general prohibition against sponsoring or investing in a covered fund could still be barred by the Volcker rule if it meets one of the permissible exceptions described below. However, even if one of these exceptions is found to be permissible, the rule could still bar it from trading.

Summary:
In 1999, an estimated 90 million persons 16 and older reported that they had participated in some sort of formal learning activity. Much of this learning takes place outside of formal credential programs that confer a certificate or degree. In the workplace, where employers offer classes for job-specific skills, or in the many courses offered by postsecondary institutions that are not part of a formal credential program. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that 1 in 4 adults are involved in some form of learning in the United States. In the 1999-2000 academic year, an estimated 7.1 million adults were enrolled as undergraduates in the nation’s postsecondary institutions. About three- quarters of these adult undergraduates were between the ages of 24 to 40, while about one-quarter were 41 or older. Compared with undergraduate students under the age of 24, adult students enrolled in.credential program, such as a continuing education class. The average age of these students was 24.5 years old. 1999-2000 were more likely to be working full time (35 or more hours per week), to be married, to have dependents, and to lack a conventional high school diploma. While the majority of undergraduates under the age of 24 were enrolled in baccalaureate programs, adult undergraduate students were primarily enrolled in certificate or associate programs in 1999-2000. Most adult students (55 percent) were enrolled at 2-year public institutions, while another 22 percent were enrolling in a public 4-year institution. Adult students received about $3.3 billion in grant assistance and $8.5 billion in loan assistance from programs authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. To receive federal financial aid, adult students must apply for federal WIA and TANF funds.

Institutions are required to establish qualitative and quantitative criteria of satisfactory progress, and to monitor student progress. Taken together, these requirements help to ensure that Title IV funds are used in ways that benefit both students and the larger public, rather than purely recreational or leisure activities. Postsecondary institutions must also meet eligibility requirements to participate in Title IV programs, including legal authorization by the state in which they offer postsecondary education. Programs authorized under Title IV include Pell Grants for low-income students and Stafford Loans. Stafford loans may be either subsidized or unsubsidized. If the loan is subsidized, the federal government pays the interest cost of the loan for the time a student is enrolled in school. The borrower is responsible for paying interest during the life of theloan. Title IV also authorizes programs funded by the Pell Grants program and by the Stafford Loans program. The federal government does not pay interest on Stafford loans. Students who apply for Title IV aid must do so using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) Information from the FAFSA is used to determine the amount of money that the adult student is expected to contribute to his or her own education. Statutory definitions establish the criteria that students must meet to be considered independent of their parents for purposes of financial aid, and statutory formulas are used to calculate the expected family contribution (EFC) The EFC is the amount that students are expected to pay for their education. establish the share of income and assets that are expected to be available for the student’s education. If the EFC is greater than the cost of attendance, the student is not considered to have financial need for federal Title IV aid programs. As table 2 indicates, the elements included in the student's cost of. attendance for the purpose of calculating the Pell Grant award vary according to the extent of. their enrollment. The elements included for the purposes of calculating Pell Grant awards vary depending on the institution. Pell Grant awards are calculated by subtracting the student’s EFC from the maximum Pell Grant award. In 1999-2000, the maximum award for a less-than- halftime student was $781. The maximum subsidized Stafford loan award is equal to the student's calculated financial need, subject to statutory limits on annual and cumulative borrowing. Students attending less than halftime are eligible to receive one-quarter of the maximumelliport award. For full-time students, maximum award was $3,125 for fulltime students. The maximum unsubsidized Stafford loan award is equal to the student’s cost of attendance, subject to statutory limits on annual and cumulative borrowing. Adult students also received financial aid from states, postsecondary institutions, and other federal sources. In 1999-2000, states awarded a total of $975 million to adult students enrolled in undergraduate education, typically on the basis of estimated financial need. About half of the states did not have aid programs in which adults enrolled less than halftime were eligible to participate. of considerations other than financial need. About $1 billion was available to the nation’s veterans and eligible service members through the Montgomery GI Bill. Financial assistance was also available to adult students from work- related sources. Employers may pay postsecondary educational expenses directly, or indirectly through employee reimbursement, and they are encouraged to do so by the federal tax code, which provides favorable tax treatment for them. The federal higher education tax credits and from employer-provided educational assistance are also available. In 1999-2000, employers provided $1.28 billion in assistance to adult students enrolled in undergraduate postsecondary education. Most often to those workers who were most likely to increase company productivity or profitability as a result of their education, such as high-skill, high-demand workers and managers. Assistance was also available to students through two federal higher education tax credits, the HOPE and HOPE tax credits.Employees were usually required by employers to meet a number of conditions to obtain this educational assistance. They were not obligated to enroll in degree or certificate programs, or to complete their studies. Both credits are nonrefundable. Eligibility for the HOPE credit is limited to students who are enrolled halftime or more in a degree or certificate program. The Lifetime Learning tax credit may be used by tax filers who enroll for any number of credits. If the filer has no tax liability, they cannot receive the credit. The HOPE tax credit and the Stafford student loan programs are not eligible for the Lifetime Learning credit. They are only available to students enrolled in their first 2 years of postsecondary education. and for any course that aids in learning new or improving existing job skills, including those that are not part of a degree or certificate program. Tax filers may use the credit for as many years as they are enrolled, without regard to degree progress or completion. In 1999-2000, all of the first $1,000 and half of the next $1,.000 of qualified education expenses per student could be used to compute the HOPE credit, for a maximum credit of $1.500. tax filer could use 20 percent of the first $5,000 in qualified educational expenses to compute the Lifetime Learning credit for a maximum credit of $1,000. Under WIA, adults and dislocated workers may be eligible to receive job training. Federal programs authorized by WIA and PRWORA may also provide some adults with assistance in meeting the costs of postsecondary education. For taxpayers filing jointly, both credits were initially phased out at $80,000 adjusted gross income, and fully phased out in 2014. Under PRWORA, block grants are made to states, which may use these funds to assist TANF recipients in meeting costs associated with vocational training or education. WIA funds may be used for postsecondary training only for expenses remaining after the receipt of Pell Grant and other sources of assistance. State and local workforce investment boards are authorized to establish limits on the amount of time or the amount of WIA  funds that may be used to meet training expenses. Under PRWORa, block grants are made to states, which may use these  funds to assist TANF recipients in meeting costs. In 1999-2000, one-third of adult undergraduate students, about 2.3 million, enrolled less than halftime. The typical less-than-halftime adult student was older, more likely to be working and married, and had a higher household income. More often enrolled without being in a degree program, according to the study. In addition to tuition and fees, childcare, and transportation, these costs may include tuition and Fees, childcare and transportation. For more information, visit www.education.gov. In 1999-2000, one-third, about 2.3 million, of adult undergraduate students were enrolled. Of those adults who expected to complete a certificate or degree and enrolled on a less than halftime basis during their first year of school, most had not completed a degree or certificate, and were no longer enrolled in school. Although less- than-halftime enrollment may permit adults to complete one or two courses helpful to their employment prospects, such enrollment appears to be an ineffective long-term strategy. less than halftime. Other adult students were either enrolled fulltime (12 or more credits), half- or three-quarters time (6-11 credits), or were in a combination of different enrollment types (mixed) Compared with adult students enrolled halftime or more, less-than-halftime adultStudents were older, and more likely to be working fulltime, be married, and have dependents. Less- Than Halftime adult students more often enrolled in 2-year postsecondary institutions, and less often pursued a baccalaureate degree. proportion of adults who enrolled on a less-than-halftime basis had household incomes over $30,000 than did adults enrolled halftime or more. An estimated 7 percent of all adult students enrolled less than halftime in 1999-2000 had. household incomes at or below 100 percent of the federal poverty guideline, which for a three-person household in 1998 was $13,650. A further 14 percent had incomes at. or below 150 percent of federal poverty guidelines, or $20,475 for aThree-person Household. School administrators say many adults have too little time to be a fulltime student. The routines of adult lifecompete with class attendance and the completion of course assignments, they say. Faced with this, many adults find it difficult to balance work and school, the administrators say. It's a balancing act that many adult students find difficult to achieve, they add. It can be difficult to meet family responsibilities and work obligations at the same time, school administrators say, adding that many adults struggle with this balancing act. “juggling act” some adult students may have to pursue postsecondary education on a less-than-halftime basis. College administrators we contacted also identified several other significant reasons why adult students might not enroll. These include the difficulty meeting the direct costs of school, scheduling conflicts, and students’ limited readiness for post secondary education. While many adult students receive some financial support towards postsecondary costs, most students pay the majority of school costs from their own resources. Because adult students find it difficult to economize on housing costs by searching for housing, some may not enroll at all. Working students may be unable to enroll on a halftime or fulltime basis due to the inflexibility of course and program options. Scheduling conflicts also played a role, according to college administrators. While some postsecondary institutions offered the majority of their programs, some offered less than halftime. Less than halftime can provides them with a way to reduce out-of-pocket costs associated with tuition and fees, as well as transportation, childcare, and books. The cost of group housing can also be reduced. Adults may find it easier to plan and manage their schedules over 5 to 7 weeks than they do over longer time periods, such as a traditional 10 or 15- week semester. At one 4-year school, only 10 percent of the undergraduate courses were offered during evening hours. At another institution, administrators noted that 3,000 course sections were offered each semester, but only 10 were available to adults in a shorter 5-7 week format, owing to reluctance of faculty to teach them. Administrators at one community college pointed to a lack of flexibility in employer work schedules. Adult students often need to refresh or develop college-level skills, they noted. Some adults may also lack confidence in themselves or their abilities, or feel out of place in school.in alternative times and formats.

National data indicate that adults enrolled on a less than halftime basis are more likely to be encountering academic difficulties than other adult students. Some adults who enroll in credit-bearing courses at postsecondary institutions may not intend to complete a degree or certificate. Some may choose to complete only a few courses, finding this sufficient to acquire the skills that help them gain employment, obtain a promotion, or find personal satisfaction. We estimate that about two-thirds (66 percent) of adults who began in 1995-1996 did not complete a certificate or degree by 2001-2002. In 1999-2000, about 7 in 10 of the nation’s less-than-halftime adult students received assistance equaling about 44 percent of their school costs. Student financial aid from federal, state, and institutional sources comprised the majority of assistance received by lower-income adults. The average Lifetime Learning tax credit was significantly smaller than the average Pell Grant award. Adults who work part-time receive employer financial assistance for enrollment in credential programs less often than those who work fulltime. In Maryland, the Baltimore City Community College and city and state officials established the School Counts Program. TANF recipients who enroll at the community college are provided with advising, assistance with transportation and childcare expenses, and federal work study assistance. These supports permit a relatively large proportion of program participants to complete a certificate or degree. The program is not available in all states, but in Maryland, it is available to TANf recipients who are enrolled in community college. It is also available in other states, such as New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. Proposed changes to the Pell Grant program include allowing room and board and miscellaneous personal expenses, as is done for fulltime students. Another proposed change would be to allow less-than-halftime students to participate in the Stafford Loan programs. Administrators of postsecondary institutions in the four states we visited expressed concern about potential negative consequences of the Stafford loan proposal. Allowing, for all less- Than-Halftime students, the inclusion of room andBoard and mis Miscellaneous Personal expenses would provide some less- than-hal halftime students with additional aid. of room and board and miscellaneous personal expenses in their cost of attendance, as is done for other students. We estimate that about 13,000 less-than-halftime students who do not receive a Pell award under current law would receive an average award of $630 under this alternative in the 2003-2004 academic year. In addition, about 150,000  students would get a Pell Grant award increase of $111 per year in 2003- 2004. (See table 4.) The proposal would also increase Pell award amounts for those who already receive a grant. total federal budget cost of changing Pell Grant policy for less-than-halftime students would be approximately $25 million for the 2003-2004 academic year. This cost estimate assumes that adults who are not enrolled in school will not choose to enroll in response to the policy change. If about 35,000 individuals who were not in school respond to this change in policy by enrolling less than halftime, an estimate implied, in part, by some research, could be an additional $10 million. Current law does not permit less-than-halftime students to participate in the Stafford loan programs. Some have proposed that these students be allowed to participate. This change to the loan program would increase federal subsidy costs associated with the Stafford programs. Campus administrators anticipate that the change could have undesirable effects on postsecondary institutions and on students. We estimate that the average unsubsidized Stafford loan taken out by adult students would increase by $113 million in fiscal year 2004. The change could also have a negative effect on students and their parents. enrolled less-than-halftime would be approximately $680, while the average subsidized loan would be about $1,200. Administrators, particularly those at public 2-year postsecondary institutions, expressed the potential disadvantages associated with expanding eligibility. Students who do not complete a certificate or degree, research indicates, are especially likely to default on their loans. Some students might prefer—or better cope with—enrollment as a less- Than-Halftime student, but are encouraged by Stafford eligibility rules to take six or more credits. adults, and a range of funding sources that support participation in them. Some sources of funding available to adult learners permit short- term study that does not lead to the completion of a degree or certificate. Federal student assistance programs authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act provide assistance for adult learning that takes place in eligible postsecondary institutions. Requiring that students enroll in—and make progress toward—a postsecondary credential ensures that the federal investment in Title IV programs is used to support learning that is broadly beneficial. less than halftime basis do not intend to complete a degree, and many others expect to do so, but are unable to continue to completion. If less than halftime adults who do not complete a credential nonetheless benefit from completing a few postsecondary courses, then federal policy tools designed to support shorter-term and non-credential adult learning can better assist these learners than can Title IV programs. The potential costs—to the federal government, institutions, and students—of proposed changes to the Pell Grant and Stafford Loan programs, particularly the latter, are significant. Permitting less-than-halftime students to participate in the Stafford student loan programs would provide a new source of borrowing for these students. Allowing less- than-hal halftime students to include room, board, and personal expenses in calculating their Pell Grant cost of attendance would most often assist students who are currently receiving a Pell grant. This would provide them with an estimated $100 annual increase in assistance, rather than providing a widely available source of assistance. It may be accompanied by unintended and unwanted consequences, including increasing the volume of loans at risk of default. assistance to adults who are not currently receiving Pell Grants. In written comments on our draft report, Education stated that it appreciated our thorough review and examination of the financial, and other, impediments that are often unique to adult learners. Education noted that the report would complement a recent report of its own and that it would assist Education in achieving one of its departmental strategic goals. Education also provided technical comments, which we incorporated where appropriate. Education’s written comments appear in the report. in appendix IV. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its date. At that time we will send copies to the Secretary of Education and other interested parties. We will also make copies available to others on request. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions or wish to discuss this material further, please call me at (202) 512-8403. contacts and staff acknowledgments are listed in appendix V. We were asked to determine: (1) the extent to which adults enroll less than halftime, the characteristics and factors associated with less-than- halftime enrollment, and the rates of completion among these students. The implications, including the budgetary impact, of changing the Pell Grant Program to allow room and board and miscellaneous personal expenses to be considered in the calculation of grant amounts for postsecondary education are also discussed in the report. The report was published by the American Council on Education. less-than-halftime students and changing the Stafford loan programs. For the purposes of this report, adult students are those who are 24 years or older. In designing our study, we reviewed data and literature pertaining to financial aid for adult students and part-time students. We analyzed focus group findings examining the barriers to enrollment and persistence faced by low-income adults. We interviewed officials at the Department of Education, researchers, and representatives of higher education organizations, such as the American Association of Community Colleges. administrators of two institutions of higher education not included in our four sample states: the City University of New York and Kaplan College. We also reviewed studies and surveys of employer- provided educational assistance. To determine the extent of less-than-halftime enrollment among adult students, we analyzed national data and visited selected postsecondary institutions. We analyzed two datasets created by the National Center for Education Statistics: the 1999-2000 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) and the 2001 Beginning Postsecondary Students Study (BPS) We computed estimates of the Lifetime Learning credits received by less-than-halftime adult students. NPSAS data are collected at the individual student level, and cannot be aggregated into families or linked to tax filing status. We treated individual students as if they were credit claimants and recipients. We reviewed existing information about the sample to assess the reliability of the N PSAS and BPS sample data. The study was published in the online edition of the Journal of the American College and University Studies. We determined that the NPSAS and BPS data were sufficiently reliable for this report. Because both surveys are samples of a larger student population, there is some sampling error associated with them. Sampling errors are often represented as a 95-percent confidence interval: an interval that 95 times out of 100 will contain the true population value. The upper and lower bounds of the 95- percent confidence intervals for each estimate are presented in the tables in appendix II. For confidential support, call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or see www.samaritans.org. National datasets provide valuable but limited information. For example, NPSAS is a cross-sectional rather than longitudinal study. We interviewed school administrators from 19 postsecondary institutions in four states. These institutions were located in California, Maryland, Ohio, and Virginia. The data were collected from 2-year and 4-year institutions in California and Maryland, and 2- year and 4 year institutions in Virginia. It is not clear if the data can be used to identify the duration for which students enrolled on a less-than-halftime basis. costs for resident tuition and fees at public 2-year institutions and the amount of available state aid varied. For example, in California the cost for resident 2- year tuition was lower than for all other states ($330), but no state aid is available to students pursuing their postsecondary credentials on a less-than-halftime basis. Maryland ranked 9th among states in tuition and Fees ($2,564) and, like California, did not have state financial aid available to less- Than-Halftime students. Both Virginia and Ohio had state aid available for less- than- Halftime students; however, Virginia’s $1,304 tuition was higher than that of Ohio. Ohio ($2,300). Within each state, we contacted three to six institutions (see table 1). Because most less-than-halftime adult students are enrolled at 2-year public institutions, we visited more of this type than other postsecondary schools. In addition, we selected institutions with large proportions of adult students in their overall student body. We met with a range of school administrators at these institutions, including financial aid officers, student affairs officers, directors of institutional research, and other administrative officers. collected institutional data on less than halftime enrollment among students graduating from 10 of the 19 we visited. We solicited information from each institutional research officer about the reliability of these data. Because these are not samples of a larger student population, there are no confidence intervals associated with them. The following steps were taken to estimate the additional federal budget costs associated with permitting degree-seeking students enrolled less than halfway to include room, board, and miscellaneous personal expenses in calculating their cost of attendance (alternative COA) for the purpose of receiving a Pell Grant. We estimated Pell Grant awards under the current law, and under an alternative COA for the 1999-2000 school year. The federal cost associated with changing the Pell Grant policy was calculated as the difference between the estimated federal cost under current law and the estimated total federal costs under the alternativeCOA. We used the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study to estimate the grants for all students in the sample who were less-than- halftime students seeking a certificate or undergraduate degree. To receive a Pell Grant under the alternative COA, the individual must have applied for financial aid. Federal costs for school year 1999-2000 were projected to school year 2003-04 by assuming that the ratio of these estimated federal costs to the total cost of the Pell grant program were the same as in school year1999-2000. To estimate the average Pell grant, we projected the estimated number of Pell grant recipients in schoolyear 1999- 2000 who are less than halftime students seeking a certificate or undergraduate degree. school year 2003-04, we projected the estimated number of Stafford subsidized and unsubsidized recipients in school year 1999-2000 who are less than halftime students seeking a certificate or undergraduate degree. For each student we estimated a cost of attendance (minus room and board and personal expenses) for the period enrolled in school. We also calculated each student’s estimated financial assistance, adding federal, state, private, and institutional aid. All students were assumed to borrow the Stafford loan amounts for which they qualify. Students who are already enrolled less than halftime in postsecondary education are unlikely to change their enrollment in response to the policy change. Seftor and Turner estimated price elasticities that fall in the range of –0.34 to -0.14. We found that the Pell Grant policy change would increase the average Pell Grant award from $0 to $630 for 0.63 percent (12,679/2,007,542) of the less-than-halftime student population. This enrollment response would cost the federal government $9,764,063 ( x $630+ [33,000,000 X 0.075 x 111/500 x 0.24] x $111).

Summary:
The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 ( H.R. 2764 ), was passed by the House on December 17, 2007, and the Senate passed a measure the next day, December 18. The bill was signed into law ( P.L. 110-161 ) on December 26. The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2008 (MILCON-VA Appropriations Act) was included as Division I of P. l 110-160. Under P.l 110-162 , the total amount of funding for the Veterans Health Administration was increased by $1.2 billion. $2.6 billion was designated as contingent emergency funding and was available for obligation only after the President submitted a budget request to Congress. Table 1 provides funding levels for VA and VHA as included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides a range of benefits and services to veterans who meet certain eligibility rules, including disability compensation and pensions, education, and health care. The VA is responsible for providing health care, pensions, disability compensation, and other benefits to veterans. training and rehabilitation services, hospital and medical care, assistance to homeless veterans, home loan guarantees, and death benefits that cover burial expenses. The VA carries out its programs nationwide through three administrations and the board of veterans appeals (BVA) The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is responsible for health-care services and medical research programs. The Veterans Benefits Administration is responsible, among other things, for providing compensations, pensions, and education assistance. The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) isresponsible for maintaining national veterans cemeteries. The VA's budget includes both mandatory and discretionary spending accounts. Mandatory funding supports disability compensation, pension benefits, vocational rehabilitation, and life insurance. Discretionary funding supports a broad array of benefits and services, including medical care. The VHA operates the nation's largest integrated direct health-care delivery system. The VA's health- care system is organized into 21 geographically diverse regions. The agency's budget authority of approximately $80 billion is about 48.1% of the total VA budget authority. defined Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs) Although policies and guidelines are developed at VA headquarters to be applied throughout the VA health-care system, management authority for basic decision making and budgetary responsibilities are delegated to the VISNs. Congressionally appropriated medical care funds are allocated to VISNs based on the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation (VERA) system, which generally bases funding on patient workload. Prior to the implementation of the VERA system, resources were allocated to facilities primarily on the basis of their historical expenditures. In FY2007, the VHA operated 155 medical centers, 135 nursing homes, 717 ambulatory care and community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs) The VHA also pays for care provided to veterans by private-sector providers on a fee basis under certain circumstances. Inpatient and outpatient care is also provided in the private sector to eligible dependents of veterans under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA) In addition to the grants for construction of state-owned nursing homes and During FY2007, the VHA had an estimated total enrolled veteran population of 7.9 million. According to VHA estimates, the number of unique veteran patients is estimated to increase by approximately 110,000. As shown in Table 3 , there would be a 2.4% increase in the total number ofunique patients (both veterans and non-veterans), from 5.7 million to 5.3 million in FY2008. The VHA collaborates with the Department of Defense (DOD) in sharing health-care resources and services. In FY2007, the VHA estimates that it will spend approximately 64.8% of its medical services obligations on outpatient care. The total number of outpatient visits, including visits to Vet Centers, reached 60.2 million during FY2006 and is projected to increase to 64.4 million in FY2007 and 67.4million in FY2008. Unlike Medicare or Medicaid, VA health care is not an entitlement program.in FY2007 to 5.8 million inFY2008. To understand some of the issues discussed later in this report, it is important to understand eligibility for VA health Care. Not every veteran is automatically entitled to medical care from the VA. Prior to eligibility reform in 1996, provisions of law governing eligibility for VA care were complex and not uniform across all levels of care. All veterans were technically "eligible" for hospital care and nursing home care, but eligibility did not by itself ensure access to care. The Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996, P.L. 104-262 , established two eligibility categories and required the VHA to manage the program. P.L. 104-262 authorized the VA to provide all needed hospital care and medical services to veterans with service-connected disabilities, former prisoners of war, veterans exposed to toxic substances and environmental hazards such as Agent Orange. These veterans are generally known as "higher priority" or "core" veterans (see Appendix A , discussed in more detail below). The other category of veterans are those whose attributable income and net worth are not greater than an established "means test," and veterans of World War I. with no service-connected disabilities and with attributable incomes above an established means test (see Appendix C ). P.L. 104-262 also authorized the VA to establish a patient enrollment system to manage access to VA health care. The Act would direct the Secretary, in providing for the care of 'core' veterans, to establish and operate a system of annual patient enrollment and require that veterans be enrolled in a manner giving relative degrees of preference in accordance with specified priorities. At the same time, it would vest discretion in the Secretary. P.L. 104-262 was clear in its intent that the provision of health care to veterans was dependent upon the available resources. The provision of hospital care and medical services would be provided to "the extent and in the amount provided in advance in appropriations Acts for these purposes," the report says. As stated previously, the bill required the establishment of a national enrollment system to manage the care provided to veterans. To determine the manner in which such enrollment system would operate, the legislation needs to be amended. delivery of inpatient and outpatient medical care. The new eligibility standard was created by Congress to "ensure that medical judgment rather than legal criteria will determine when care will be provided" For most veterans, entry into the veterans' health-care system begins by completing the application for enrollment. Some veterans are exempt from the enrollment requirement if they meet special eligibility requirements. A veteran may apply for enrollment by complete the Application for Health Benefits (VA Form 10-10EZ) at any time during the year. Once a veteran is enrolled in the VA health-care system, the veteran remains in the system and does not have to reapply for enrollment annually. Those veterans who have been enrolled in Priority Group 5 (see Appendix A , discussed in more detail below) based on income must submit a new VA Form 10-10EZ annually with updated financial information demonstrating inability to defray the expenses of necessary care.at any VA medical center or clinic, or mailing or faxing the completed form to the medical center and clinic of the veteran's choosing. Veteran's status is established by active-duty status in the military, naval, or air service and an honorable discharge or release from active military service. People enlisting in one of the armed forces after September 7, 1980, and officers commissioned after October 16, 1981, must have completed two years of active duty or the full period of their initial service obligation to be eligible for VA health-care benefits. Servicemembers discharged at any time because of service-connected disabilities are not held to this requirement. who completed the term for which they were called, and who were granted an other than dishonorable discharge, are exempt from the 24 continuous months of active duty requirement. National Guard members who were called to active duty by federal executive order are also exempt from this two-year requirement. When not activated to full-time federal service, members of the reserve components and National Guard have limited eligibility for VA health-care services. Members of the Reserve components may be granted service-connection. The National Guard may be given service- connection. for any injury they incurred or aggravated in the line of duty while attending inactive duty training assemblies, annual training, active duty for training, or while going directly to or returning directly from such duty. Reserve component service members may be granted service-connection for a heart attack or stoke if such an event occurs during these same periods. The granting of service- connection makes them eligible to receive care from the VA for those conditions. National Guard members are not grantedService- connection for any injury, heart attack, or stroke that occurs while performing duty ordered by a governor. state emergencies or activities. After veteran's status has been established, the VA next places applicants into one of two categories. The first group is composed of veterans with service-connected disabilities or with incomes below an established means test. These veterans are regarded by the VA as "high priority" veterans, and they are enrolled in Priority Groups 1-6 (see Appendix A ). Veterans in need of care for a service- connected disability; veterans who have a compensable service-connections condition; veterans whose discharge or release from active military, naval, or air service was for a compensative condition. disability that was incurred or aggravated in the line of duty; veterans who are former prisoners of war (POWs); veterans awarded the Purple Heart. The VA looks at applicants' income and net worth to determine their specific priority category and whether they have to pay co-payments for nonservice-connected care. In addition, veterans who were exposed to hazardous agents (such as Agent Orange in Vietnam) while on active duty are considered a priority category for the VA's care. veterans are asked to provide the VA with information on any health insurance coverage they have, including coverage through employment or through a spouse. The VA may bill these payers for treatment of conditions that are not a result of injuries or illnesses incurred or aggravated during military service. The second group of veterans is composed of those who do not fall into one of the first six priority groups.primarily veterans with nonservice-connected medical conditions and with incomes and net worth above the VA-established means test threshold. These veterans are enrolled in Priority Group 7 or 8. The VHA is mandated to provide priority care for non-emergency outpatient medical care for any condition of a service-connected veteran rated 50% or more. According to VHA policies, patients with emergency or urgent medical needs must be provided care, or must be scheduled to receive care as soon as practicable, independent of service- connected status and whether care is purchased or provided directly by the VA. These veterans are enrolling in Priority Groups 7 and 8. Veterans rated less than 50% service-connected disabled need to be scheduled to be seen within 30 days of the desired date. When VHA staff are in doubt as to whether the request for care is for a service- connected condition, they are required to assume, on behalf of the veteran, that the veteran is entitled to priority access and schedule. Veterans in other priority groups are to be treated as if they were in the same condition as those in the 50% rated disabled group. According to VHA policies, all outpatient appointment requests must be acted on as soon as possible. VHA guidelines state that veterans with service-connected conditions cannot be prioritized over other veterans with more acute health-care needs. The total level of funding for VHA increased between FY2006 and FY2008, and most of this increase has been due to the increase in spending on medical services. As a percentage of total VHA funding, as seen in Figure 1, medical services account is the largest. VHA spending on medical facilities, medical administration, and medical and prosthetic research has been fairly stable. In addition to direct appropriations for the above accounts, the Committees on Appropriations include medical care cost recovery collections. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ( P.L. 99-272 ), enacted into law in 1986, gave the VHA the authority to bill some veterans and most health-care insurers for nonservice-connected care provided to veterans enrolled in the VA system. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 ( P.L. 105-33 ) gave the VHA the authority to retain these funds in the Medical Care Collections Fund (MCCF) Instead of returning the funds to the Treasury, the VA can use them for medical services for veterans without fiscal year limitations. To increase the VA's third-party collections, the act also gave the VA authority to change its basis of billing insurers from "reasonable costs" to "reasonable charges" This change in billing was intended to enhance VA collections to the extent that reasonable charges result in higher payments than reasonable costs. the Administration's budget requested consolidating several medical existing collections accounts into one MCCF. The conferees of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004 ( H.Rept. 108-401 ) recommended that collections that would otherwise be deposited in the Health Services Improvement Fund (former name), Veterans Extended Care Revolving Fund (Former name), Special Therapeutic and Rehabilitation Activities Fund ( former name) and Medical Facilities Revolving fund (formername) should be deposited into MCCf. The Consolidated appropriations act of 2005 provided the VA with permanent authority to deposit funds from these five funds. The funds deposited into the MCCF would be available for medical services for veterans. These collected funds do not have to be spent in any particular fiscal year and are available until expended. The purpose of this pilot project is to provide a "comprehensive restructuring of the complete revenue cycle including cash-flow management and accounts receivable" The conferees included this provision because the FY2006 Military Construction, Military Quality of Life and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act required the VA to establish a revenue improvement demonstration project. Appropriation Committees were concerned that the VHA was collecting only 41% percent of the billed amounts from third-party insurance companies. The VHA has established a pilot Consolidated Patient Account Center in VISN 6. MCCF collections increased by 31%, from $1.5 billion in FY2003 to $2.0 billion inFY2006. In FY2006, first-party collections represented approximately 43% of total MCCf collections. The Administration requested $32.7 billion for the program in FY2007. On May 19, 2006, the House passed its version of the Military Construction, Military Quality of Life, and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill (MIL-CON-QUAL-appropriations bill) for FY2007. H.R. 5385 provided $32.7 billion for the VHA, a $3.4 billion (11.4%) increase over the FY2006 enacted amount of $29.3 billion and about the same as the President's request. The Senate passed the bill on November 14, 2006. On February 15, 2007, the President signed into law the Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2007. $32.7 billion for the VHA for FY2007, a $14.7 million increase over the President's request and $3.3 billion above the FY2006 enacted amount. On May 24, 2007, the House and Senate approved the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 ( H.R. 2206 ). The bill was signed into law on May 25 ( P.L. 110-28 ). For FY2008, the Administration requested $27.2 billion for medical services. $818 million increase over the Administration's request. Increase in funding to address insufficient funding levels in the advanced planning fund and to compensate for cost adjustments to previously appropriated major construction projects. The Appropriations Committees included several major areas of interest to the Appropriations Committees, and incorporated some report language from H.R. 2764 and S.Rept. 110-85. The Appropriation Committees approved the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008. The Act provided funding for specific VA construction projects as requested by the Administration. have urged both DOD and VA to seek every opportunity to partner to improve the continuity of care for veterans. Joint clinics; joint Centers of Excellence for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Joint research and/or treatment; and the development of joint clinical practice guidelines for polytrauma injury, TBI, burns, and amputee care, among other things. Currently, there is no medical diagnostic code specific to TBI. It is a challenge to quantify the number of TBI cases. International Classification of Diseases-9 th Revision (ICD—9) codes to better reflect the TBI patient population within both DOD and VA. Beginning with FY2009, the appropriators are directing the Administration to include TBI as a select program within the medical services account. The Appropriation Committees expressed concern about insufficient funding levels for mental health and substance abuse services in the FY2008 budget request. The Administration's budget request had included a reduction in the number of inpatient beds for psychiatric care and an anticipated increase of less than one. The Consolidated Appropriations Act ( H.R. 2764 , P.L. 110-161 ) includes increased funding for substance abuse services. The appropriators also directed the VA to reexamine the policy for a reduction in psychiatric inpatient care, taking into account the needs of returning OIF and OEF veterans. Furthermore, the bill directs the VA not to reduce the number of inpatient psychiatric beds at any facility that currently has a waiting list. The bill is expected to become law by the end of the year. in remote rural areas has been a long standing issue. To address this issue the appropriators have directed the VA to provide a report to the committees that includes a description of the unique challenges and costs faced by veterans. The report should also identify the need to fund alternative sources of medical services in areas where VA medical facilities are not accessible to veterans without them leaving such areas. Moreover, the report should identify the needs for funding to provide care in these areas without the need for veterans to leave the area. The Consolidated Appropriations Act directs the DOD and VA to provide a joint report to the Committees on Appropriations detailing the actions being taken by each Department to achieve an interoperable electronic medical record (EMR) system. The report should also contain an assessment of the potential for increasing local access to medical services for veterans in remote rural areas through strategic partnerships with other government and local private health care providers. The bill was passed on a bipartisan basis and is expected to be signed into law by President Barack Obama. In its FY2008 budget request, the Administration has put forward several legislative proposals. These proposals are similar to previous ones included in the Administration's budget requests for FY2003, FY2004, FY2005, FY2006, and FY2007 and rejected by Congress each year. However, unlike previous budget proposals, revenue from the proposals in the FY 2008 budget request would not be deposited in the Medical Care Collections Fund (MCCF), but would be classified as mandatory receipts to the Treasury. Similar language has been included in a Defense Appropriations conference report ( H.Rept. 110-434 ). The President's FY2008 budget request includes three major policy proposals. Assess a tiered annual enrollment fee for all Priority 7 and 8 veterans based on the family income of the veteran. Increase pharmaceutical co-payments from $8 to $15 (for each 30-day prescription) for all enrolled veterans in Priority Groups 7 and8. Bill veterans receiving treatment for nonservice-connected conditions for the entire co-payment amount. A detailed description of these budget proposals can be found in the budget request. The Administration is proposing a tiered annual enrollment fee, which is structured to charge $250 for Priority 7 and 8 veterans with family incomes from $50,000 to $74,999. The VA has estimated that this proposal would contribute more than $138 million to the Treasury annually, beginning in FY2009. The MILCON-VA Appropriation Act ( P.L. 110-161 ) does not include any bill language that would give the VA money for the tiered enrollment fee. The Administration proposes increasing the pharmacy co-payments from $8 to $15 for all enrolled Priority Group 7 and Priority Group 8 veterans. The Administration put forward this proposal in its FY2004, FY2005, FY2006, and FY2007 budget requests as well, but did not receive any approval from Congress. At present, veterans in Priority Groups 2-8 pay $8 for a 30-day supply of medication, including over-the-counter medications. When veterans reach the annual cap, they continue to receive medications without making a co-payment. medication co-payment will be increased to $8 for each 30-day supply of medication furnished on an outpatient basis for treatment of a nonservice-connected condition. The annual cap for veterans enrolled in Priority Groups 2-6 will be $960. The VA estimates that if the current proposal to raise the co- payment were enacted, it would contribute $311 million to the Treasury in FY2008 and will increase revenue by $1.6 billion over five years. The MILCON-VA Appropriation Act ( P.L. 110-161 ) does not include any bill language that would give the VA the authority to increase co-payments. According to VA estimates, of the 5.8 million unique patients that it expects to see in 2008, 111,000 may choose not to use the system if an enrollment fee is imposed. The Administration is requesting that Congress amend the VA's statutory authority by eliminating the practice of reducing first-party co-payment debts with third-party health-insurance collections. The VA asserts that this proposal would align the VA with the DOD health-care system for military retirees and with the private sector. Under current law, the VA is authorized to collect from third-party health insurers to offset the cost of medical care furnished to a veteran. If the VA treats an insured veteran for a nonservice-connected disability, and the veteran is also determined by the VA to have co-payment responsibilities, theVA will apply the payment collected from the insurer to the veteran's care. The VA also established co-payments from veterans for this care. In 1986, Congress authorized theVA to collect payments for the treatment of veterans with nonservices-connected disabilities. Under the current co-payment billing process, in cases where the cost of a veteran's medical care for a nonservice-connected condition appears to qualify for billing, the VA sends the bill to the insurance provider. The veteran's co- payment obligation is placed on hold for 90 days pending payment from the third-party payer. If no payment is received from theThird-Party payer within 90 days, a bill is sent to the veteran. Under the Administration's proposal, veterans receiving medical care services for treatment of non-service-connected disabilities will receive a bill for their entire co- Payment. This proposal would apply to all veterans who make co-payments. According to VA estimates, this proposal will increase revenue by $44 million in FY2008 and $217 million over five years. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have not addressed this issue because it is an issue in the purview of the authorizing committees. On February 15, 2007, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) testified that "assuming no major changes in policy ... that [VHA] medical spending would increase from $35 to $35" The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have expressed concern that the President's budget has not accurately projected the future cost of health care for veterans from FY2008-FY2012. The House Appropriations Committee expressed doubt in the actuarial model currently used to project health-care demand for Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi freedom (OIF) veterans. The Senate Appropriations Committee has included a general provision in H.R. 2642 directing the CBO to submit a CBO report on the issue. report projecting the annual funding level necessary for the VHA to continue providing health care for veterans from FY2009 through FY2012.

Summary:
Cybersecurity is a cross-cutting field that affects many government and non-governmental stakeholders. For example, the U.S. military views cyberspace as a warfighting domain as well as a force enabler. For the Department of Defense, cybersecurity takes on an offensive or defensive national security role. For purposes of this report, cybersecurity is broadly defined as the protection of critical information infrastructure and its processes and content. It should be noted that some of the apparent gaps discovered may actually be addressed by existing classified programs. President Obama announced the creation of a new cabinet-level position to coordinate cybersecurity strategy and policy across the federal government. While every department and agency has an individual and collective role in securing federal cyber enterprises, some organizations have appeared to have greater authority and capability than others. Common themes often noted by many cybersecurity experts underscore a lack of transparency and dearth of defined roles and responsibilities in addressing cyber-related issues. Such concerns often assert that a continuation of addressing cyber incidents as a individual agency's responsibility will eventually lead to increased national vulnerabilities. Bills in the 111 th Congress that Address a Cybersecurity-related Issue. Bills directly tied to cybersecurity include S. 1438 Fostering a Global Response to Cyber Attacks Act. Cybersecurity components as part of broader legislation include H.R. 2195 and S. 773 Cybersecurity Act of 2009. Bills tied via appropriations or authorization include HR 2892 and HR 2200.

Summary:
Since 1872, hardrock mining on federal lands has been governed by the General Mining Law. The law allows virtually free access to open public domain lands for mineral prospecting, staking claims, exploration and development. Proposals to reform the Mining Law have been made almost from the time it was signed by President Grant. The major reform bill in the House is H.R. 2262, which would impose an 8% ad-valorem royalty based on the value of the minerals. A factor payment in a competitive market for a royalty to be based on other than market value minus the costs of obtaining it. For example, if instead of payments in kind (deer or crops or precious metals) the landowner were to be paid in money, one would expect him to receive the monetary equivalent of the value of the output. Rational landowners would not settle for less than what the deer, crop, or metal is worth because they could always have the deer and crops taken to market and sold for at least that amount. The ad-valorem royalty appears to be economically the most efficient type of royalty. But the question becomes to what base specifically should the royalty rate apply? The aggregate value of a commodity being the product of a price (value/unit) and a total output, the questions are what is the appropriate royalty rate for this commodity? The answer is that it should be based on the aggregate value, rather than the price/unit, of the commodity as a whole. If the renter wanted less rent, then presumably that would have been negotiated as a smaller share. are: At what point can the value of a mine's output first be determined? Further, since throughout the production stage value is added or increased, at what stage does mining value end, and non-mining value begin? Production of valuable mineral products from raw hardrock minerals (e.g., metals such as iron, copper, aluminum, gold, lead) generally involves various stages: extraction or quarrying of the raw minerals, delivery to a plant or mill in order to produce valuable products.  production stages are shown for the typical case or mineral in Figure 1. Within these production stages, from extraction to the first sale to manufacturers, there may be various points at which there is created a valuable output. Depending on the type of mineral, and the structure of the mineral, there are different production stages for different types of mineral. These stages include the initial processing, beneficiating or concentrating to derive an ore concentrate (generally the first valuable product), smelting or refining (i.e., additional processing) of the ore concentrate in order to derive the marketable metal or mineral. industry—there may be several different types of mineral products with value. Does the mine produce the raw mineral ore, the ore concentrate, or the final metal or mineral sold to wholesalers? Further, even if the output of the mine can be determined, there is the problem of what is the value or price of that output. For example, copper is traded in many forms that relate to different stages of processing: at the mine, copper may be sold as ore, concentrate, and precipitate. There may not actually be a sale throughout the mining-production-processing-marketing (sale) stage. Any price or value would have to be constructed, i.e., estimated or derived, from values further upstream when they are first determined or identified. One measure of the value of mining output is gross income from mining as defined under the income tax laws for purposes of determining the percentage depletion allowance, one of several tax preferences or subsidies available to a mining firm. This royalty base has been suggested many times in the past. the current and past royalty debates and is the base proposed in H.R. 2262. The main reason for suggesting this royalty base is that not only is gross income under the tax depletion rules consistent with the economic concept of an ad-valorem royalty, but the legal and regulatory apparatus has been in place since 1932, the year that percentage depletion first became available to the hardrock mining industry. This would tend to reduce the costs of industry compliance and government administration of the royalty system. The term "gross income" as used for purposes of percentage depletion is somewhat confusing. While the term is intended to measure only sales revenue from mining operations, income in the context of a business generally refers to profits and not sales. The term may be misleading because it may suggest a larger percentage depletion deduction, and therefore a larger royalty payment than a "net" royalty. But, in fact, whether a gross royalty base is smaller or bigger than a net royalty base depends on the point in the production stage the price is. Under Internal Revenue Code, mining companies are allowed a depletion deduction, at varying percentages, based on the gross income from mining. Because value is added as mining production moves from the extraction or quarrying state to the smeltering stage, a net price (such as net smelter return) further downstream would generally be greater than a gross price further upstream. The term "mining" includes not merely the extraction of the ores or minerals from the ground but also the treatment processes considered as mining. price used to determine gross income. Under IRS regulations, gross income for depletion purposes is defined as "the actual price for which the ore or mineral is sold" Price of ore concentrate would depend on the (wholesale) price of the final metal (including related metals) on commodities markets, and the percentage of the metal in the ore. If the mining process is not used, the ore concentrate is sold at a lower price than if it is used to transport the ore from the mine. firm is an integrated producer, i.e., it has smelting/refining operations, and also applies non-mining processes to the ore concentrate before the mineral is sold. There may be no sale of either the raw ore, or ore concentrate, and hence no price for the mineral firm's output until the final metal (gold, for example) is sold in the commodities markets. In these cases, percentage depletion is based not on actual gross income but what is called "constructive" gross income. This is income derived from or approximated by using representative market prices elsewhere in that particular market. in cases where there is no representative price from sales of the same ore concentrate (the mining output) in other markets, then gross income from mining is estimated by multiplying gross sales by the ratio of mining to total costs. As a hypothetical example, assume that the market price of the final cast copper on the commodities exchanges is $3.60/lb, which is $7,937/metric tonne of pure copper. Also assume that one metric ton of copper ore concentrate contains 30% pure copper and no other valuable minerals. The remaining 70% is sulfur, iron, and other impurities that have no value. "Net smelter return" is a common term used in the mining industry to refer to the net average revenue per unit of the smelted mineral product sold by the miner. It is essentially an estimate of the price the miner receives, or equivalently, the price paid by the smalter, for the ore concentrate produced, based on the price for the pure metal. At 8%, the royalty on this would be $14.24 million. From mining in this one year, the royalty from this could be $178.6 million. The Net Smelter Return is the amount of money which the smelter or refinery pays the mining operator for the mineral product. It is usually based on a spot, and is based on the price on the London Exchange or the Chicago Commodities Exchange. According to Cartright (2007), The Net Smalter Return is the amount of money which the smalter pays the mineral operator for the product and is usually based on a spot, or the price on the London Exchange. or current price of the mineral, with deductions for the costs associated with further processing. In non-metal mines the selling price is usually 'fob mine site' because of the transportation costs involved in delivering the mineral product to the buyer. In Canadian law, net smelter return is defined in the same way. According to Barten (1993), a net Smelter Return is ... the amount received by the mine or mill owner from the sale of the Mineral product. From the gross proceeds received there may be. deductions for costs incurred by the owner after the property leaves the mine property and before sale. Costs of transportation, insurance, or security, penalties, sampling and assaying, refining and smelting, and marketing. No deductions are made for the operating costs of the mine-mill complex. A net smelter return will be ... the net value of minerals from the property, where Net Value is Gross Value less certain permitted expenses. Gross value will usually be defined with reference to the spot price of an average weekly or monthly spot price on specified markets. The permitted deductions will include all charges by the smelter, such as smelting and refining charge as well as penalties for impurities in the ore. In some cases deductions may also be made for taxes except income taxes and, depending on the nature of the commodity, for marketing costs. The similarity of these definitions of net smalter return (gross price less non-mining costs) times output to the gross income base under the percentage depletion rules is readily apparent. The following two examples, from contracts or royalty deeds between a landowner (the vendor) and the mining company (the purchaser), illustrate the legal language used in defining a net smelters return. of transportation and handling of such concentrates, metals (including bullion) or products from the Claims to any mint, smelter, refinery or other purchaser. c) related insurance on such concentrate, metals, bullion or products. Thus, continuing with the above hypothetical copper example, the net smalter return would be the price at which cast copper could be sold after the costs of smelting and refining the copper ore are subtracted. Using the same figures as before, the market price of the final cast copper is $3.60/lb. tonne (2,205 lbs) of pure copper would be valued at $7,938. One ton of copper ore concentrate contains only 30% pure copper, so that the value of one tonne of that ore concentrate is 30% of that, or $2,381. To calculate smeltering and refining costs assume that these are 10% of the price of the cast copper. Then costs would be $238/tonne of copper concentrate (equal to $0.36 x 0.30 x 2,205) smelter/refiner, it would equal the actual (or constructive) sales revenue to the mining company of the ore concentrate. If annual sales were 100,000 metric tonnes of copper concentrate, total net smelter return revenues would be $214 million. At 8%, the royalty on thiswould be $17 million. This is because final metal prices are high relative to smelting/refining costs. In general, the higher are metals prices relative to costs (in which case mineral producers earn extra or more) windfall profits) the more net smelter returns diverge from gross income. Another royalty base that has been mentioned in the General Mining law debate is net profit. Here the royalty would be a certain percentage of the miner's net after-tax profit or income. For any mining company (indeed for any business) net profit is, of course, less than sales revenue by the costs of doing business, thus resulting in a smaller royalty base from which to calculate royalty payments. Reducing royalty payments to the federal government might Net profits are notoriously variable, difficult to measure, and susceptible to accounting manipulations. This method could create incentives for mining companies to claim significant deductions from their income such that there would rarely be a profit against which to levy the royalty. Depending upon the royalty rate this could lead not only to smaller royalty payments than either a gross income or net smelter return royalty, but perhaps to no royalty at all. Some advocates of the net system believe that it is the best way to make money from mining. after-tax profit type of royalty, for example the 1993 bill S. 775, would have measured net profits at the mine mouth. Royalties on coal extracted from federal lands, at the 8% or 12% royalty rate, are also assessed on the "gross proceeds" from the sale of the coal. For oil, gas, and coal, federal royalties are calculated on the gross proceeds (or gross sales revenues) from the contract sale. For geothermal resources, the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 (as amended) instituted a 10%-15% royalty on federal leases. There is another side to the externality concept: external costs. It appears that some external effects associated with hardrock mineral production are net "external costs" rather than net external benefits. Without land reclamation, there would presumably be damage to the environment, which is an external cost to society. This is a cost that the typical profit-maximizing hard rock mineral producer does not usually account for in its decision-making. The external costs from hardrock Mineral production are the degradation of the environment. the normal business decisionmaking process. Consequently, since the accountable business costs are lower than the real costs (including external costs) prices are lower. Under this reasoning, if the presence of external benefits is dismissed and the Presence of external costs is considered significant, the appropriate federal policy would be a tax. This is the economic rationale for the abandoned mineland reclamation fee under SMCRA, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. Two other conditions might be required for the fee to be reinstated. mitigate against the use of the market-determined royalty rate. If private landowners exercise monopoly power or some other type of market power, then it would be possible to extract from the mining companies higher than competitive royalty rates. In the second case, if the mining industry is concentrated and exercises market power—control over prices, for example—it might lead to underpayment of royalties. The market- determined royalty rates might actually be higher than they appear to be, the authors say. be too low. These are complex issues which are difficult to analyze. Much of the land from which hardrock minerals are produced is owned by the federal government. It might be in a position to take advantage of its power to obtain royalty payments above the competitively determined rates. Such payments, combined with the bonus bids, would appropriate for society the economic rents—the abnormal or excess profits (i.e., windfalls)—from the production of scarce natural resources. In reality, of course, the government policy is just the reverse: It charges a royalty rate of zero, which is definitely below the market-determined rates. rate. Much land is also privately owned or owned by state or local governments or Indian tribes, which suggests that the market-determined royalty rates might be a reliable indicator of competitive rates. As to the hardrock mineral industry structure, available data suggest that the industry, both in the United States and throughout the world, is somewhat concentrated. Hardrock mining is a highly capital intensive business and large enterprises can operate more efficiently. In the U.S., many of the mining firms are large multinational mining conglomerates. Five of the top ten claim holders (who hold more than $1 billion) are multinationals. 16% of all claims on western public lands are foreign corporations. The hardrock mining industry is dominated by about 40 companies. The top four account for 35% of total market capitalization. This would suggest that the market-determined royalty rate might actually be too low. On balance, it might be the case that the above two opposing forces tend to offset each other and the government would want to use the more appropriate competitive rate. This is more consistent with economic efficiency, and social welfare, than a zero rate. royalty rate should apply to all hardrock minerals or whether the rate should vary by type of mineral in some logical way. On the one hand, a variable rate is unnecessary because the base is ad-valorem, so the royalty amounts automatically vary in proportion to mineral value. More valuable minerals pay greater absolute royalties per unit. Table 2 gives an illustration for metals. Note that the royalty in column (4) is based on the gross value of the metal in the commodities markets and does not allow deductions for smeltering costs and A constant royalty rate tends to minimize both economic distortions and administrative costs. Private royalty agreements, which are negotiated on a case-by-case basis, have widely varying royalty rates. These can range from 1-10%, and differ by mineral types. Under one possible structure that has been suggested, the royalty rate itself would be a function of—it would vary positively with—the amount of such costs. The figures do not represent either net smelter returns or gross income from mining, both of which would be less by the amount ofSuch costs. Mineral prices would probably not increase very much because for most minerals, prices are determined in the international market. Less land would be mined and fewer U.S. hardrock minerals would be produced and more imported than under a no-royalty system. This would likely contribute to a more economically efficient use of the nation's resources, which would tend to promote the welfare of society. The payment of a royalty to the federal government for the services from the mineral land would increase federal revenues, although revenue generation is not the primary rationale for the imposition. holding fee, from $30 to $50 per claim, and from $125 to $150 per claim respectively. Under federal budget rules fees collected by federal agencies, such as the Department of the Interior, are considered as offsetting budget receipts, or negative spending. Such receipts reduce the agencies' outlays. The U.S. hardrock minerals industry is a major source of revenue for the federal government. The revenue estimates are net of federal income tax revenues due to the deductibility of royalty payments and fees against business taxes. subject to the same income tax laws which apply to all other for-profit businesses, paying federal income, payroll, and other federal taxes. The federal corporate income tax applies a 35% rate to most corporate taxable income. Reduced tax rates, either 15%, 25%, or 34%, apply to "smaller" corporations, those earning less than $10 million of income. In addition, corporate stockholders pay individual income taxes on their corporate-source capital gains and dividends. As business entities, hardrock mining companies benefit from many different different tax rates. types of untargeted tax incentives, provisions that are generally available to non-mining businesses, as well as some tax provisions specifically targeted toward mining. Under IRC §199, "manufacturing" businesses are allowed a deduction, as a business expense, for a specified percentage of the qualified production activity's income. The deduction was 3% of income for 2006, is currently 6%, and is scheduled to increase to 9% when it goes into effect in 2009. The tax benefits are the §199 manufacturing deduction and accelerated depreciation. The deductions are subject to a limit of 50% of the wages paid that are allocable to the domestic production. fully phased in by 2010. For the domestic mining industry (which includes the oil and gas industry), the deduction applies to any primary product "manufactured, produced, or extracted in whole or in significant part in the United States" Note that extraction is considered to be manufacturing for purposes of this deduction. Effectively, the deduction is equivalent to a reduced marginal tax rate. For example, at the top marginal corporate tax rate of 35%, which typically applies to large corporations, this would be a 35% deduction. such as hardrock mining companies, the current deduction of 6% is equivalent to a marginal corporate income tax rate of 32.9% (35% x 0.94) rather than 35%. Another untargeted or general tax provision that is important to the hardrock mineral companies is accelerated depreciation. This deduction is intended to provide a business reasonable allowance for the exhaustion and wear and tear (i.e., depreciation) of business property. It is analogous to the cost depletion allowance for investment in a mineral deposit (as discussed below) companies incur geological and geophysical (or surveying, and reconnaissance investigation) costs. These include the costs of staking the claim, removal of property line obstructions, limited removal of overburden, and limited sluicing. The removal of large amounts of overBurden would indicate that a deposit may have already been found and the mine may be in a different stage. Exploration expenditures include the Costs of Surveying, test pitting, trenching, drilling, driving of exploration tunnels and adits, and similar types of work. The costs of exploratory drilling to ascertain the extent of commercially marketable ores are treated by the tax law as a mineral exploration cost. These types of costs are all deductible rather than capitalized. Expenditures made after the existence of ores or minerals has been disclosed are considered mine development expenditures, and these are deductible as well as exploration costs. The tax law does not apply to exploration expenditures made in connection with the development of a new mine or a new ore deposit. It only applies to the exploration costs associated with the discovery of new ore deposits. also qualify for expensing treatment. These are costs associated with bringing the mine to production. Activities associated with development are building roads, clearing the land, and other activities to prepare a site for the production stage. Expensing applies only to domestic mines; exploration and development cost of foreign properties must be either depleted or amortized over a 10-year period using straight-line method. The costs of constructing or sinking a mine shaft, or the costs of driving tunnels and galleries, are development costs, which may be expensed. amortization. Mining companies may only expense 70% of the exploration and development; the remaining 30% must be amortized over five years. Recapture is accomplished by either including the amount expensed as ordinary income or by subtracting it from the percentage depletion allowance. This makes it especially important for mining companies to determine when exploration ends and development begins, as well as when production commences and when the mine is sold. It is also important to know when exploration begins and development ends, so that the company can determine when to recapture costs. The percentage depletion allowance is available to virtually all mineral producers except integrated oil and gas producers. Percentage depletion rates range from 5% for stone and clay to 22% for uranium and beryllium. Most of the hardrock minerals have a depletion rate of 22%, and several have either a 15% or 14% rate. For iron ore (and coal) mined by corporations, the allowance must be reduced by 20% of the excess of percentage depletion over cost depletion (IRC §291) the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 ( P.L. 97-248 ). In effect this limitation reduces the 22% depletion rate to an effective depletion rate of between 17.6% and 22%, depending upon the amount of cost depletion. The Joint Tax Committee estimates the revenue losses from the above three special tax preferences or subsidies (formally called "tax expenditures"). The latest five-year estimates (from FY2007-2011) are as follows: $0.5 billion for expensing of mine exploration and development costs. which are a list of ten tax breaks or subsidies that have been identified as potentially able to reduce a business's or individual's tax liability to little or nothing. The intent is to assure that all taxpayers—individuals and businesses—pay some tax, which is not assured if taxpayers are able to claim a lot of special tax breaks. In effect, the alternative minimum tax imposes an additional tax above and beyond the normal or regular income tax on the total amount of these ten items of tax preference. items are tax breaks that are important to the mining industry. Excess of percentage depletion over cost depletion, and the excess of the exploration and development cost deduction over a hypothetical deduction. A third item of tax preference that the mining firm would have to include in its list of tax preferences is accelerated depreciation over straight line depreciation. To the extent to which mining companies use these and other items of tax preference, this could have a significant impact on their tax bills in the future. It could also have a negative impact on the mining sector as a whole. trigger the minimum tax, and thereby reduce the value of the special tax provisions. These special tax preferences or subsidies, combined with accelerated depreciation (a significant tax benefit for highly capital intensive business such as hardrock mining) have historically resulted in relatively low effective average and marginal tax rates. Thus, firms that mine hardrock minerals on public domain lands pay no royalty, and benefit from fairly significant tax subsidies. For example, CBO recently published a study of effective tax rates on different types of assets, and those used in mining. mine shafts) generally ranked fairly low, relative to assets used in other industries. mining companies pay a variety of claims fees (location fees, Bureau of Land Management processing fees, annual maintenance fees) These are charges for specific types of administrative services provided by the BLM. The claims location fee is presently $30 per claim, which is about 20 acres. The annual maintenance (or holding) fee, necessary to hold a claim on public land, is currently $125 per claim. This fee applies to claim holders with 11 acres or more. The location fee and the annual maintenance fee are adjusted for inflation. The BLM also assesses a processing fee of $15. These fees help the BLM cover its costs of administering the mining law and regulations. They cover costs for such actions as processing and recording applications, certain exploration permits, name changes, and corporate mergers. On November 1, 2007, the United States House of Representatives approved a substitute version of H.R. 2262 (with amendments), the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act. of 2007. This bill would: establish a new regulatory framework for administering permits to develop hardrock minerals. permanently end the sale or "patenting" of public lands for mining, which has been under moratorium since the early 1990s. Use 75% of the proceeds for the cleanup of abandoned sites; impose an 8% gross income royalty future hardrock mining operations, and an 4% royalty rate on current mining operations; require miners to seek additional permits to explore for and develop mineral resources and meet certain standards related to reclamation of mined. lands; create an abandoned mine reclamation program similar to the one currently in place for coal sites; make the income from hardrock mining fees and royalties available, subject to appropriation, to support reclamation programs and to provide assistance to certain state, local, and tribal governments. 50% of the cleanup funding would be directed to the state in which the royalties were generated; direct the Secretary of the Interior to prioritize reclamation projects that protect public health and safety, particularly from water pollution, and for projects that restore wildlife habitat. the Committee bill, watershed areas would be designated as eligible reclamation projects and among the top priorities for receiving cleanup funds. establish environmental standards specific to the hardrock mining industry. establish a new definition of "undue degradation" of public lands and resources and give the Secretary of the Interior broader authority to block mining operations that would cause such harm. allow Native American tribes to petition the federal government to withdraw federal lands with cultural and religious values. The substitute version of H.R. 2262 would be less prescriptive and more performance-oriented than the original bill. from mining activities (similar language has been in place for states and localities) Set guidelines for administrative and judicial review of actions authorizing mining on public lands. Allow citizen lawsuits challenging federal decisions. Set guidelines to allow citizen lawsuits against federal decisions on mining activities. Allow for citizen lawsuits to challenge federal decisions about mining activities on public land. Allow state and local governments to sue the federal government to stop mining on their land.

Summary:
DHS and Coast Guard acquisition guidelines require operational test and evaluation by an independent test agency. The Coast Guard uses the U.S. Navy’s COTF to conduct operational tests and other evaluations for its major acquisition programs. For operational effectiveness, testers determine whether or not an asset can meet its missions. For for operational suitability, testers assess an asset's operational effectiveness and suitability to perform its duties as a Coast Guard vessel or aircraft carrier. For full-rate production, testers must confirm that the production configured system meet all requirements before approval. operational suitability, testers determine whether or not the agency can logistically support the asset to an acceptable standard. Critical operational issues (COI) are one metric used to determine an asset’s operational effectiveness and suitability and are stated in the form of a question. COIs are examined during testing to evaluate a system's ability to provide the desired capability and perform its mission. COTF assessed the NSC's COIs, for example, by comparing the outcome of the test event against the full scope of the COI. determine whether the COI was met or not. Unmet COIs are often the result of related deficiencies, which are identified during testing and include any system that is lacking in its ability to meet normal standards or to function as intended. Deficiencies are scored based on the severity of the problem and its impact on the asset’s ability to accomplish its mission. COIs and deficiencies identify during testing both factor into an asset's overall operational effectiveness and suitability rating. In addition to verifying that an asset is operationally effective and suitable, operational testing also tests key performance parameters. are the capabilities considered essential for mission accomplishment. KPPs are listed by threshold values, which are the minimum acceptable level of performance. For example, a KPP for the NSC is being able to reach a maximum speed of 28 knots for a threshold value and 31 knots for an objective value. K PPs differ from COIs in that KPP's focus on specific performance metrics, while COIs focus on certain types of missions that an asset should be able to conduct or an asset’s ability to be ready to perform those missions. Operational testing can occur over many test events. Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) is meant to gather the data necessary to resolve COIs. Follow-on operational test and evaluation (FOT&e) is conducted after IOT &E and an asset’s full rate. The test event concludes with a rating of operationally effective or not effective, operationally suitable or not suitable. Table 1 provides examples of COIs and KPPs for the NSC. production decision and focuses on refining the conclusions that were made during previous operational test events. It also validates any incomplete or deferred requirements and verifies the correction of deficiencies identified during IOT&E. COTF writes a test report that focuses on the resolution of the asset’s COIs and any deficiencies that were identified during testing. These reports typically include a summary of the resolutions of the COIs. FOT&e concludes with an operational effectiveness and suitability rating similar to that of IOT &E. It focuses on evaluating production changes and reevaluating the system to ensure that it continues to meet operational needs. IOT&E took place about 2 years later than planned and after 7 of the 8 planned NSCs were under contract, with 3 operational. We have previously found that delaying critical test events can lead to late discoveries and could result in additional design changes and costs to programs. During testing, the NSC successfully demonstrated 18 of its 19 COIs, with one COI — cybersecurity—being a success. The 8 N SCs are planned to be fully operational by 2020 and the Coast Guard is phasing out the legacy 378-foot High Endurance Cutters. deferred to FOT&E. This deferral was due to the DHS Director of Operational Test and Evaluation postponing the testing of the NSC’s cybersecurity capabilities until a more robust test plan could be developed to reflect emerging threats. Five of the 10 major deficiencies pertained to the N SC’S weapon systems and cutter boats. None of the major deficiencies were rated as severe, which would preclude the NCC from accomplishing its mission. In its assessment, COTF found the NNC to be operationally effective and suitable, but with 10major deficiencies. of the NSC’s IOT&E event, DOT&E stated that the reliability and operational availability issues of the weapon systems. The CIWS, NULKA launcher, and TRS-3D air search radar, and the 57-mm gun were all repaired following the event. Post-operational reports indicate that problems persist with these systems as they were often unavailable during operations. Despite these findings, as noted above, COTF found the N SC to be operationally effective and suitable. are measures of the capabilities considered essential to mission accomplishment. In our January 2016 report, we found that during IOT&E and other test events, the NSC fully met 12 of its 19 KPPs. The Coast Guard is not able to demonstrate that it is providing the capabilities that it intended to field. For instance, the Coast Guard has not yet demonstrated that it can achieve a hard and soft kill against a subsonic cruise missile as required, or fully meet interoperability requirements with the Department of Defense, DHS and other government agencies. Of the 7 KPPs not met, 3 pertain to the NSC’s cutter boat operations. We found that the Coast Guard and COTF have different interpretations of the cutter boat K PPs. The cutter boats are designed to be integral to the. NSC's overall capability, operate both within. and beyond the visual range of the N.SC, and enhance the overall mission effectiveness of theNSC in. every mandated mission area. The NSC conducted IOT&E according to the test and evaluation plan for the cutter boats. and determined that the three KPPs involving cutter boats were not fully met since the boats are unable to operate through all sea state 5 conditions. According to Coast Guard officials, the September 2012 requirements document for the NSC should have been written more clearly to convey the sea state expectation for cutter boat launch and recovery operations. The NSC’s sea state KPP was never intended to be applicable to the operation of the cutter boats. In January 2016 we recommended, and the Coast Guard concurred, that the N SC’S K PPs for the operation  should be. DHS approved the NSC program for full rate production in October 2014. FOT&E will begin in the fall of 2016 and is scheduled to continue through at least 2017, COTF officials say. The Coast Guard will conduct FOT &E and the acquisition review board (ARB) will review major acquisition programs for proper management, oversight, accountability, and alignment with DHS’s strategic functions at acquisition decision events and other meetings as needed. The resulting acquisition decision memorandum (ADM) from October 2014 directed the Coast Guard to conduct Fot & E and the ARB. complete three action items: (1) complete testing of the cybersecurity COI; (2) verify the correction of all major deficiencies, including the unmet KPPs; and (3) assess the NSC’s cyber-security capabilities. The cybersecurity COi is planned to be tested in 2016, which, if successful, will address the first and third requirements of the ADM. Other testing events are expected to occur through 2017 and possibly beyond. According to Coast Guard officials, they have corrected 4 of the 10 major deficiencies. IOT&E that involved equipment failures by restoring the operational status of the related systems on the Stratton. The Coast Guard has plans to correct four more. However, according to Coast Guard documentation and officials, they may not correct 2 deficiencies due to the cost of making fleet-wide changes. Table 4 shows the Coast Guard’s plans, as we reported in January 2016, for resolving the major deficiencies. The NSC will have accepted the delivery of the new Stratton by the end of the year. of at least the 6th NSC before the testing is complete, meaning that the Coast Guard will be operating 6 NSCs before it has resolved issues from IOT&E. DHS’s guidance for its major acquisitions does not require programs to conduct FOT &E. We concluded in our January 2016 report that this gap in DHS guidance also has implications for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. We are happy to clarify that this is not the case with the Navy and Marines. The Coast Guard is in the process of designing the OPC, which is the last of the major cutter classes to be built. This cutter class is intended to bridge the mission gap between the FRC and NSC. The OPC is estimated to cost $12.1 billion, making it the most expensive Coast Guard recapitalization program to date. Without updated guidance that establishes timeframes and responsibilities for completing all testing, the Coast Guard risks encountering the same scenario with OPC and other future DHS assets. The Coast Guard has encountered several issues that require major retrofits and design changes on the NSC. The total cost of changes we identified as of June 2015 totals approximately $202 million. Early testing can allow performance issues to be discovered at a point when fixes can be incorporated into the design of an asset while it is still in production. The Coast Guard will be faced with paying for the replacement of these systems with new equipment that it must also purchase.. The process to date reflects some lessons learned in the areas of competition and the schedule for IOT&E. The Coast Guard is using a two- phased, competitive strategy to select a contactor to construct the OPC. In general, as we have previously found, competition is likely to save taxpayer dollars as opposed to a sole source acquisition approach, such as was used for the NSC. The Coast Guard currently plans to award the construction contract for the lead OPC ship in fiscal year 2018 and deliver this ship in 2021. After the first 3 of the planned fleet of 25 OPCs are built, the Coast Guard plans to increase its purchase to 2 O PCs per year until the final asset is delivered, currently scheduled for fiscal year 2035.

Summary:
Both the House and the Senate are considering legislation to support medical innovation. Reforms to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and changes to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Both NIH and FDA are agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Senators Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray, chairman and ranking Member of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, announced the start of a bipartisan initiative to "examine the process for getting safe treatments, devices and cures to patients and the public" roles of the [FDA] and the [NIH] in that process." This initiative culminated in a package of 19 bipartisan bills that were reported out of the Senate Health, Labor, Education, and Pensions (HELP) Committee. One of these 19 bills, The Adding Zika Virus to the FDA Priority Review Voucher Program Act (S. 2512), subsequently was passed by both chambers and signed into law on April 19, 2016 (P.L. 114-146) include the following: S. 1878, The Advancing Hope Act of 2015; S. 1622, The FDA Device Accountability Act of2015;. S. 2503, Preventing Superbugs and Protecting Patients Act; and S. 2030, The. Advancing Targeted Therapies for Rare Diseases Act of 2016. Also S. 800, The Enhancing the Stature and. Visibility of Medical Rehabilitation Research at NIH Act; S., 849, Advancing Research for Neurological Diseases Act. The Senate's medical innovation package is that chamber's companion effort to the House's 21 st Century Cures initiative. The package includes the Medical Countermeasures Innovation Act of 2015; S. 1767, The Combination Products Innovation Act, and S. 2700, FDA and NIH Workforce Authorities Modernization Act. It also includes the Advancing Precision Medicine Act of 2016 and the Promoting Biomedical Research and Public Health for Patients Act. The bill also includes S. 185, Promise for Antibiotics and Therapeutics for Health Act; and S 2745, Advancing NIH Strategic Planning and Representation in Medical Research Act. H.R. 6 is the result of a series of hearings and roundtable meetings hosted by the House Energy and Commerce Committee dating back to spring 2014. The hearings androundtables focused on a broad range of topics, including modernizing clinical trials, incorporating patient perspectives into medical research and regulatory processes, precision/personalized medicine, digital health care, and more. The bill was passed on July 10, 2015, on a vote of 344 to 77. While consisting of many different provisions, the bill is primarily focused on efforts to increase strategic investments in medical research. medical research at NIH and change some aspects of how the FDA executes its regulatory oversight mission. This report provides for each of the 18 bills in the Senate medical innovation package: (1) background on the issue, or issues, addressed by the bill; (2) a summary of the bill's provisions; and (3) where applicable, identification of comparable provisions in H.R. 6. In some cases, the House and Senate legislation address the same topic in the same bill. The report also provides a comparison of the Senate bill with the House bill. an entirely different way. In other cases, the House and Senate legislation address the topic in a similar way but with key substantive differences. For a summary of all the provisions in H.R. 6 , as passed by the House, see CRS Report R44071, H.r. 6: The 21st Century Cures Act. The HHS Human Subject Regulations are a core set of federal standards for protecting human subjects in HHS-sponsored research. These regulations are the basis for the bill. commonly referred to as the Common Rule because the same requirements have been adopted by many other federal departments and agencies. Research protocols must be approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) to ensure that the rights and welfare of research subjects are protected. FDA has issued its own set of Human Subject Regulations, which are similar, but not identical, to the Common rule. FDA applies these regulations to all the research it regulates, including clinical trials of new drugs and medical devices, regardless of the source. All clinical evaluations of investigational devices (unless exempt) must have an investigational device exemption (IDE) before the clinical study is initiated. An IDE allows an unapproved device (most commonly an invasive or life-sustaining device) to be used in a clinical study to collect the data required to support a premarket approval (PMA) submission. A device can be shipped lawfully for investigation of the device without requiring that the manufacturer comply with other requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) such as registration and listing. An HDE application is similar to a PMA, but it is exempt from the effectiveness requirements. Such devices may be used in a facility only after a local IRB has approved their use in that facility. The provision would amend Section 520(g) of the FFDCA, regarding IDEs, by removing the word "local" in all references to local IRBs, including in the stipulation that the device be used only in emergency situations. It would also remove the word 'local' from all reference to the facility. that an approved humanitarian use device may be used in a facility only after a local IRB has approved such use, except in certain emergency situations. The use of non-local IRBs for review of IDEs and HDEs provision in H.R. 6 (i.e., Title II, Subtitle O, Section 2262) is comparable to S. 1622. The provision would also require the Secretary, within 12 months of enactment, to revise or issue regulations or guidance, as necessary, to carry out these amendments. CLIA requires laboratories to receive certification before they are allowed to carry out clinical laboratory testing on a human sample. CLIA certification is based on the level of complexity of testing that a laboratory is performing, graded as low, moderate, or high. Laboratories that perform only low-complexity tests (called waived tests ) receive a certificate of waiver (COW) from CMS. Conversely, only laboratories certified to do so may may test on human samples. FDA is responsible for categorizing clinical laboratory tests according to theirlevel of complexity. FDA determines whether a test is waived (i.e., low-complexity) or not based on information submitted by the manufacturer. Under current law, waived tests are those "that have been approved by FDA for home use or that have an insignificant risk of an erroneous result" The guidance recommends ways to demonstrate that atest is both "simple" and has "an insignificant risk" of an "erroneous" result. Demonstrating the test is simple is one way to prove that it is not too complex. latter includes showing that a test's accuracy is comparable to a method whose accuracy has already been established and documented. S. 1622 Section 3 would require the Secretary to publish draft guidance that revises Section V of the current guidance. Not later than one year after the comment period for the draft guidance closes, the Secretary would be required to publish the guidance. The draft guidance would provide clarification on the appropriate use of comparable performance between a waived and moderately complex laboratory user to demonstrate accuracy. It would also address approaches to demonstrating accuracy. Section 2228 of H.R. 6 (Title I, Subtitle M) is substantively identical to the Senate legislation. Section 205 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA, P.L. 105-115 ) amended Section 513 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) The two provisions stipulate that FDA consider the "least burdensome" data or information "necessary" to demonstrate a reasonable assurance of device effectiveness. The two provisions are as follows: Section 513(a)(3)(D)(ii) Any clinical data, including one or more well-controlled investigations, specified in writing by the Secretary for demonstrating a reasonable assurance of device effectiveness shall be specified. The Secretary shall consider, in consultation with the applicant, the least burdensome appropriate means of evaluating device effectiveness that would have a reasonable likelihood of resulting in approval. Whenever the Secretary requests information to demonstrate that devices with differing technological characteristics are substantially equivalent, the Secretary may use this information. FDA published final guidance on the least burdensome provisions on October 4, 2002. Under the guidance, FDA may allow the use of non-clinical data in place of clinical data for the approval of PMA devices. In certain circumstances, such as "devices or modifications of approved devices for which scientifically valid information is available in the public domain," FDA may use such data in the PMA approval process. When clinical data are needed, FDA allows for non- clinical data to be used. manufacturers to consider study designs to shorten the length of the study. Such study designs include the use of "surrogate endpoints and statistical methods, such as Bayesian analyses" The absence of problems in laboratory testing may not always predict what happens to a device over time in the human body. For example, "the malfunction of [Medtronic and St. Jude Medical] implantable cardioverter-defibrillator leads, which resulted in the death of one patient" in a widespread recall, and the hazards posed by particles shed from [DePuy] metal-on-metal hip replacements were not predictable based on engineering insights or in vitro studies. The 2002 FDA guidance states, "[r]eliance on postmarket controls ... should be considered as a mechanism to reduce the premarket burden for 510(k)s and PMAs" However, the FDA's authority to require postmarket studies of medical devices is limited. A September 2015 GAO study found that of the 392 postmarket surveillance studies ordered by FDA, only 38 were ordered by the FDA. between May 1, 2008, and February 24, 2015, 88% were inactive, 10% were ongoing, and 2% were complete. Activities related to implementing the least burdensome provision, including training for staff and advisory panels, are posted on FDA's website. S. 1622 , Section 4, would amend FFDCA Section 513 by adding a new subsection (j), "Training and Oversight of Least Burdensome Requirements" The Secretary would be required to ensure that each FDA employee involved in the review of premarket submissions, including supervisors, receives training. such requirements, including employee training. Under the Senate bill, 18 months after enactment, the FDA ombudsman responsible for device premarket review would be required to conduct an audit of the least burdensome training, including the effectiveness of the training. The audit would be needed to include "interviews of persons who are representatives of the industry regarding their experience" and a list of the measurement tools used to assess the implementation. A summary of the audit findings would berequired to be submitted to the Senate HELP Committee and the Senate. S. 1622 would amend FFDCA Section 515(c), adding a new paragraph that would require the Secretary to "consider the least burdensome appropriate means necessary to demonstrate device safety and effectiveness" It would define the term necessary to mean "the minimum required information that would support a determination by the Secretary that an application provides a reasonable assurance of the safety" and would state that the role of postmarket information must be considered in determining the least burdening means of demonstrating a device. reasonable assurance of device safety and effectiveness. In addition, the provision would amend FFDCA Section 517A(a), adding that each substantive summary of the scientific and regulatory rationale for any decision made by FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) regarding the submission or review of a PMA, a 510(k), or an IDE must also include a brief statement. The provision regarding training and oversight in least burdensome appropriate means in H.R. 6 (Title II, Subtitle M, Section 2223) is comparable to S. 1622. Secretary would be required to issue draft guidance, no later than 12 months after enactment. Draft guidance would update the October 4, 2002, final guidance on the least burdensome provisions. The House provision amending FFDCA Section 515(c) would not require that postmarket information be considered in determining a reasonable assurance of device safety and effectiveness. The provision does not amend FFD CA Section 517A(a) regarding the substantive provisions of the bill. The bill is expected to be signed into law by the end of the year. summary of any decision made by CDRH on the least burdensome requirements. FFDCA Section 510(k) requires medical device manufacturers to register with the Secretary and, at least 90 days prior to introducing a device intended for human use into interstate commerce, to report to the Secretary. This notification requirement is part of the 510(K) premarket approval pathway, a process that is unique to medical devices and if successful results in FDA clearance. Under FFD CA Sections 514 and 515, manufacturers are required to report on their compliance with applicable device regulatory requirements. In March of 2015, FDA released final guidance on the reprocessing of reusable medical devices. Reusable medical devices are those devices that may be reprocessed and used on multiple patients. Under the 510(k) pathway, the manufacturer must demonstrate that a new device is substantially equivalent to a device already on the market (a predicate device) The guidance focuses on balancing risks versus benefits for patients, drafting a Data Development Plan by the medical device sponsor and collecting postmarket data on a medical device that has received a priority review designation. S. 1077 would add Section 515B, "Priority Review for Breakthrough Devices," to FFDCA. Section would allow requests for priority review from device sponsors of PMA medical devices. Such requests would be evaluated by a team of experienced FDA staff and senior managers. Each priority review device would be assigned a team, "including a team leader with appropriate subject matter expertise and experience," the bill says. The House provision would allow denied priority review requests to be reconsidered. S. 1878 would amend the definition of "rare pediatric disease" in FFDCA Section 529(a) It would also extend eligibility for a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher. The bill would extend the authority to award such priority review vouchers until September 30, 2022. H.R. 6 contains a comparable provision (Section 2152, Reauthorization of Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Incentive Program) The House provision does not specify that the agreement on clinical protocols and any subsequent changes must be agreed to in writing. individuals based on specific patient characteristics. This approach relies on companion diagnostics to target drugs and biological products to specific subsets of patients. Rare diseases often have genetic origins, and advances in medicine have resulted in the development of new treatments that work by targeting genetic mutations that cause the disease. It is inherently difficult to develop drugs for rare diseases because of the small patient population available to conduct clinical trials, so targeted therapies are generally first developed for patients with the most frequent disease-causing mutations. additional targeted therapies would need to be developed. Targeted therapies, because they may be treating small subsets of patients, sometimes qualify as "orphan drugs" Such drugs are called orphan drugs because firms may lack the financial incentives to sponsor products to treat small patient populations. Orphan drugs receive their designation pursuant to FFDCA Section 526(a), a designation that was created by the Orphan Drug Act ( P.L. 97-414 ) to encourage firms to develop pharmaceuticals to treat rare diseases and conditions. S. 2030 would add a new Section 529A "Targeted Drugs for Rare Diseases" to the FFDCA. It would facilitate the "development, review, and approval of genetically targeted drugs and variant protein targeted drugs" It would apply to a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 persons in the U.S. or affects more than200,000 people in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug available will be recovered from sales. drugs to address an unmet medical need in one or more patient subgroups, including subgroups of patients with different mutations of a gene. This legislation would authorize the Secretary to allow the sponsor of a new drug application for a genetically targeted drug or a variant protein-targeted drug to rely on data and information that has been previously developed and submitted, either by the same or a different sponsor (with permission) for a drug that incorporates or utilizes the same genetically targeted technology or for a similar drug. S. 2030 would define genetically targeted drugs, genetically targeted technology, and variant protein-targeted drugs. New Section 529A should not be construed to limit the Secretary's product approval authorities, or to entitle sponsors to obtain information in another sponsor's application without permission of the other sponsor. H.R. 6 would add a new Subchapter J, Precision Medicine, to Chapter V of the FFDCA; this subchapter would include a new Section 592, "Precision medicine" The new FFDCA Section 592 would allow the Secretary to do two things.regarding orphan-drug and expedited-approval programs. The Secretary would be allowed to rely on information about a drug or biological product that has been previously submitted, either by the same or a different sponsor (with permission) in approval. The bill would also allow the secretary to approve a drug that has already been approved by the FDA for an orphan drug. The Senate version of the bill passed the Senate with a vote of 98-0. of an application. This may be for either a new product, or for a different indication for an existing product. Second, in contrast to the Senate bill, it would allow the Secretary to consider the application for expedited review programs, including accelerated approval. Similar to S. 2030 , new Section 592 should not be construed to limit the Secretary's product approval authorities, or to entitle sponsors to obtain information in another sponsor's application without permission. FDASIA ( P.L. 112-144 ) expanded FDA's authorities and strengthened the agency's ability to safeguard and advance public health. a new FFDCA Section 569C "Patient Participation in Medical Product Discussion," facilitating increased involvement of patients earlier in the regulatory process for medical product review. The Secretary is directed to develop and implement strategies to solicit the views of patients during the medical product development process and consider the perspectives of patients. The patient representative may serve as a special government employee in appropriate agency meetings with medical product sponsors and investigators. The secretary is also directed to explore means to provide for identification of patient representatives who do not have any, or have none. minimal, financial interests in the medical products industry. S. 1597 would amend FFDCA Section 569C by adding a new subsection (b) "Statement of Patient Experience" would require the Secretary, upon approval of a new drug application, to make public any patient experience data and related information submitted and reviewed as part of the application. "Data and information" refers to patient experiencedata, information on patient-focused drug development tools, and other relevant information, as determined by the Secretary. guidance, over a period of five years, regarding the collection of patient experience data and the use of such data in drug development. This section describes the content of those required guidance documents. "patient experience data" is data that are collected by any persons (including patients, family members and caregivers of patients, patient advocacy organizations, disease research foundations, researchers, and drug manufacturers) and are intended to provide information about patients' experiences with a disease or condition, including the impact of such disease or Condition on Patients' lives. patient preferences with respect to treatment of such disease or condition. S. 1597 would require the Secretary, acting through the FDA Commissioner, to publish, no later than June 1, 2021, 2026, and 2031, on the FDA website. H.R. 6 also contains a provision related to patient experience data (Title II, Subtitle A, Section 2001, "Development and Use of Patient Experience Data to Enhance Structured Risk-Benefit Assessment Framework" The bill is expected to become law in the next few weeks. H.R. 6 would amend FFDCA Section 505 by deleting a clause from Section 505(d) and adding new subsections (x) and (y) The new 505(x) would restate the deleted 505(D) requirement for the Secretary to "implement a structured risk-benefit assessment framework in the new drug approval process" The new505(y) would require the secretary to "establish and implement processes under which" entities "seeking to develop patient experience data" could submit ideas and data. "patient experience data" would be defined as data collected by patients, parents, caregivers, patient advocacy organizations, disease research foundations, medical researchers, research sponsors, or other parties determined appropriate by the Secretary. The new subsection would also require the Secretary to issue implementation guidance after holding several methodological workshops and a public meeting. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), each year in the United States, at least 2,000 people die of cancer. and nonmanufacturer groups. million people become infected with bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics, and at least 23,000 of them die from these infections. Addressing barriers to antibiotic drug approval may help counter this problem. One such proposal is the so-called Limited Population Antibacterial Drug (LPAD) approval pathway for new antibacterial drugs. Such a pathway would involve smaller clinical trials in a limited population of patients that have serious or life-threatening infections and unmet medical needs due to the lack of an effective approved antibiotic. This streamlined approach would result in more uncertainty about potential risks posed by the product, and therefore a greater need for post-market scrutiny. Section 2 would amend PHSA Section 319E to require the HHS Secretary to encourage and assist in reporting of antibacterial drug use, drug resistance, and antibiotic stewardship programs in health care facilities of the Indian Health Service, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and Department of Defense (DOD) It would also provide guidance and other informational materials about antibiotic stewardships for residential and ambulatory health care. facilities; (4) assist states with their antibacterial resistance prevention activities; and (5) establish a mechanism for facilities to report antibiotic stewardship activities and drug resistance. Section 2121, subsection (g) would add a new subsection 317U to the PHSA requiring the HHS Secretary to establish a monitoring system for the use of antibacterial and antifungal drugs, including products approved under the LPAD pathway. The Secretary would be required to make summaries of data from this system publicly available. Section 3 would create new FFDCA Section 506(g), "Limited population pathway for antibacterial drugs" This review pathway would allow the Secretary to approve an antibacterial drug as an LPAD drug if certain conditions are met. It would require that the Secretary's standards for new drug application approval are met, and that the sponsor receives a written request from the sponsor to approve the drug as a LPAD. The drug would have to treat a serious or life-threatening infection in a limited population of patients with unmet needs. determination of the safety and efficacy of a limited population antibacterial drug "reflect[s] the benefit-risk profile of the drug in the intended limited population" Products approved using this pathway must carry prominent labeling noting the intended use for a limited and specific population of patients. Sponsors must submit promotional materials to the FDA for review 30 days prior to dissemination. Section 3 would require the Secretary to issue within 18 months of enactment guidance "describing criteria, processes, and other general considerations" for demonstrating the drug's safety and effectiveness. of limited population antibacterial drugs." It would also require the Secretary to provide advice to the sponsor regarding the approval of an LPAD drug. Section 3 would require the secretary to report to Congress at least every two years on the number of requests for approval. It also would require GAO to report on the coordination of monitoring activities required by S. 185. The legislation would allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to remove any post-marketing conditions (e.g., labeling requirements) Section 4 states that S. 185 should not be construed to alter current prescribing or other medical practices. The House provision would add a new FFDCA subsection 505(z), "Approval of certain antimicrobial and antifungal drugs for use in a limited population of patients" This would be an expedited review pathway for certain antibacterial and antIfungal Drugs. This would include drugs such as Zyrtec, which has been shown to be effective in reducing infections. biologics) intended for use in limited, defined populations of patients that have severe, life-threatening infections. Some elements of the review pathway proposed in the House bill are comparable to those in the Senate bill, for example. The Secretary could consider limited data sets and non-clinical data as substantial evidence of safety and effectiveness, recognizing the smaller populations available for study of an LPAD drug, and the different balance of benefit and harm. The bill would require the Secretary to report back to Congress by the end of the year. versus harm in these populations. Products approved using this pathway must carry prominent labeling noting the intended use for a limited and specific population of patients. Sponsors must submit promotional materials to FDA for review 30 days prior to dissemination. FDA would be required to issue draft implementation guidance within 18 months of enactment. This provision should not be construed to alter current prescribing or other medical practices (such as off-label prescribing). Other elements of the review pathway were found only in the House provision, for example. FDA may enter into written agreement with the sponsor to define the process and data needed to review the limited population use application. The process must adhere to existing goals and procedures agreed upon by sponsors and FDA in the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012 ( P.L. 112-144 , Title I). The House provision would require the Secretary to conduct and publish an assessment of the program within 48 months of enactment, and to seek public input. It also would allow the secretary to allow the public to participate in the process. Precision medicine is the idea of providing health care to individuals based on specific patient characteristics. Currently, medical care is generally provided in a "trial and error" manner, with treatment adjusted based on real-time patient response. Precision medicine would tailor medical treatment to individual patients, thus aiming to improve health outcomes and save health care costs. On February 25, 2016, the White House hosted a Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) Summit to mark the launch of PMI in the U.S. the one year anniversary of the initiative's launch, first announced in the 2015 State of the Union address. The PMI's three key agencies—National Institutes of Health (NIH), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC)—began work in this area. The FY2017 President's budget requests a total of $309 million for the PMI: $4 million to ONC and $3 million to NIH. FDA, $5 million to ONC, and the remaining $300 million to NIH. Precision medicine research efforts rely on the collection of large amounts of health data. The sharing of genetic and genomic data among private individuals, researchers and the federal government has, at times, prompted concerns that the information, if collected or retained by a federal executive branch agency, could be subject to public release pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act. FOIA, however, specifies nine categories of information that may be released. Exemption 3 allows agencies to withhold applicable records if the data are specifically exempted from disclosure by a statute other than FOIA. These types of Exemption 3 statutes are often referred to as b(3) exemptions. As a mechanism for addressing compelled disclosure of research data, NIH currently issues Certificates of Confidentiality pursuant to §301(d) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. §241(d)) at the request of an investigator. A Certificate is an official document issued by the National Institutes of Health. of Confidentiality protects investigators from being compelled to disclose information that would identify research subjects in any civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding. This requirement can help promote participation in research by adding an additional layer of privacy protection. In contrast to compelled disclosure of research data by FOIA request, sharing of genomic data generated by NIH-funded research is a priority of NIH. The agency has established a comprehensive policy for the sharing of genetic data that "applies to all NIH- funded research that generates large-scale human or non-human genomic data" The NIH Common Fund, within the Office of the NIH Director, supports the High-Risk, High-Reward Research Program. This program has "four unique funding opportunities for exceptionally creative scientists who propose highly innovative approaches to major challenges in biomedical research" If investigators fail to submit the required data, NIH may withhold funding. These awards are intended "to encourage creative, potentially high-reward, research.subsequent research," according to the program's website. For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch, or see www.samaritans.org. Other transaction (OT) authority is a special vehicle used by certain federal agencies for obtaining or advancing research and development (R&D) An OT is not a contract, grant, or cooperative agreement, and there is no statutory or regulatory definition of "other transaction" Only those agencies that have been provided OT authority may engage in other transactions. Generally, OT authority is created because the government needs to obtain leading-edge R&D from commercial sources, but some companies are unwilling or unable to comply with the government's procurement regulations. The Advancing Precision Medicine Act of 2016 would codify the President's Precision Medicine Initiative. It would also protect identifiable, sensitive information from release under FOIA. The act would also require the sharing of NIH-supported research data in certain circumstances. The bill would also support high-risk, high-reward research in the U.S. and around the world. It was introduced in the Senate on September 14, 2015. It has been referred to as the Advancing precision medicine act of 2016. the carrying out of the PMI as well as identifying requirements of the initiative (§2) Amend PHSA Section 301(d) to require the Secretary to issue a Certificate of Confidentiality to research investigators of federally funded research in which sensitive, identifiable information is collected to protect the privacy of research participants. The provision would prohibit the individual with the certificate from disclosing sensitive information about the research participants, with certain exceptions, as specified, and would make this type of information immune from the legal process. (b)(3) specified biomedical information that identifies an individual or that has an associated risk that the information may be reidentified. The Secretary would be required to make each such exemption available in writing and to the public, upon request (§4). Amend PHSA Section 402(b) to allow the Secretary to require recipients of NIH grants or agreements to share data generated from such NIH grants in a manner consistent with all applicable federal law (§5) Add a new PHSA section to allow NIH Director to approve requests by institute and center directors to engage in transactions other than other transactions. than a contract, grant, or agreement with respect to projects for high-impact, cutting-edge research, as specified. This provision would require the Secretary to submit a report to Congress evaluating the activities under this new subsection by September 30, 2020. Title II, Subtitle C, Section 2041, of H.R. 6 addresses precision medicine but is not comparable to S. 2713 in its approach. It would also, for a precision drug or biological product, issue and periodically update guidance. product application where the product is for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and has been designated as an orphan drug. FDA regulatory authority over medical product safety and effectiveness covers drugs, biological products, and medical devices. S. 1767 would amend Section 503(g) of the FFDCA to require the Secretary to assign a primary center for the regulation of combination products and to conduct premarket review of these products under a single application whenever appropriate. The bill would allow the sponsor, if the plan were to be denied, to request a meeting with the Secretary. FDA provided examples of mobile apps that do not meet the statutory definition of a medical device. The agency also gave examples of apps that pose a significant risk to patient safety. The updated guidance did not address regulation of CDS software. The House bill also would establish a risk-based exception allowing FDA to exert regulatory authority. would exclude certain types of software applications from FDA's regulatory oversight. S. 1101 would exclude products that provide administrative and health management functions; software that creates, stores, transfers, and displays patient information; and analytic tools that provide both general and patient-specific information. CMS eliminated several clinical documentation objectives, and instead focused on a few objectives that capture more advanced uses of the technology. CMS also published an accompanying final rule (the 2015 Edition final rule) that expands the certification program. In addition to certifying the next generation of EHR technology that hospitals and physicians need to achieve meaningful use Stage 3, the program will be able to certify health information technology (HIT) products with a different combination of capabilities and functionalities that meet the needs of other types of patients. of health care providers and settings that are not eligible to participate in the EHR incentive program. The 2015 Edition final rule for the certification program established new transparency requirements for HIT developers. It also seeks to improve interoperability, for example, by requiring certified HIT products to adopt new and updated vocabulary and content standards for structured health information. ONC released a national interoperability roadmap in October 2015. It was developed over an period of time over the course of a few years, ONC says. 18-month period with input from numerous stakeholders—to coordinate efforts around achieving HIT interoperability. ONC expects the roadmap to evolve in partnership with the public and private sectors as technology and policy dictate. 2017 set as the deadline for individuals and health care providers along the care continuum to be able to send, receive, find, and use core clinical data. The roadmap discusses the payment and regulatory drivers for promoting interoperability, as well as the central policy and technical components of a fully interoperable nationwide health information infrastructure.  MACRA declared it a national objective to achieve widespread interoperability of certified EHR technology by the end of 2018. The law defines interoperability as the ability of health information systems to not only exchange clinical information but to also use the information based on common standards. In addition, MACRA instructed the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to develop a national plan for EHR interoperability by the year 2020. The goal is to improve care and patient outcomes, according to the law. within one year of enactment, to submit a report to Congress on ways to help health care providers compare and select certified EHR technology. MACRA required the Secretary, in consultation with stakeholders, to establish interoperability metrics to measure progress toward achieving the national objective of widespread interoperability by July 1, 2016. If that objective is not met by December 31, 2018, the Secretary will have until Dec. 31, 2019, to identify the barriers to widespread interoperable. The Secretary will also have to submit to Congress a report on how to make EHR users and vendors publicly available. ONC released a report to Congress on health information blocking in April 2015. ONC is taking, in coordination with other federal agencies, to address information blocking. The report identified gaps in authority that limit the ability of ONC to effectively target, deter, and remedy such conduct. MACRA requires eligible hospitals and hospitals and other health care providers to share electronic health information with the federal government. It also requires the government to make sure that the information is accurate and up-to-date. physicians, beginning April 2016, to indicate through meaningful use attestation (or some other process specified by the Secretary) that they have not knowingly and willfully taken any action to limit or restrict the interoperability of their certified EHR technology. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule gives individuals the right of access to inspect, obtain a copy of, and transmit to a third party a copyof their health information. One of the meaningful use objectives that must be met by hospitals and physicians using certified Ehr technology is to provide individuals with the ability to view, inspect and transmit.  ONC released a report on patient identification and matching (i.e., linking patient records with the correct individual) in February 2014. It recommended standardizing patient attributes for the purpose of information exchange. The 2015 Edition final rule for the certification program requires EHR developers to publish programming instructions to enable other software application developers to produce apps giving individuals access to their clinical data. It also introduces EHR certification criteria for capturing patient identification standards. For more information, visit ONC's Patient Identification and Matching website. rule for the HIT certification program. Certified EHR systems must be able to create a summary-of-care document that includes the following standardized patient data: first name; last name; previous name; middle name (including middle initial); suffix; date of birth (year, month, and day are required fields; hours and minutes are optional); address; phone numbers (home, business, cell) S. 2511 includes multiple provisions to promote HIT interoperability, penalize information blocking, reduce the administrative and other burdens of using EHR technology. S. 2511 would establish a program and methodology for calculating and awarding a star rating to each certified HIT product. The rating program's methodology and criteria would be posted online, as would each HIT product's star rating (the rating system must use at least three stars) HR 6 would repeal the interoperability provisions in MACRA. It would eliminate the HIT Standards Committee and require the Secretary to require the HIT standards development organizations directly with contract development organizations. It also would extend federal protections to HIT developers who report and analyze patient safety information related to HIT use. Senate bill, H.R. 6 would not establish a star rating program for certified HIT products. Bill would not address patient access to electronic health information, patient record matching, the regulatory and administrative burdens of using EHR technology, or the development of trusted relationships between existing HIT networks. The Project BioShield Act ( P.L. 108-276 ), the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA, the Act was passed after the terrorist attacks of 2001. Interagency working group, the Public Health and Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise (PHEMCE), is responsible for coordinating these activities. The PHEMCE is headed by the HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) and includes representatives from the HHS, CDC, FDA, and other agencies. The federal countermeasure strategy requires coordinated activities by several separate agencies. It is designed to ensure federal countermasure needs are addressed efficiently. For confidential support call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or visit http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/. Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 ( P.L. 113-5 ) requires the ASPR to develop an annual "coordinated 5-year budget plan" for countermeasure basic and advanced research, development, and procurement activities. Act established the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to develop and procure medical countermeasures against CBRN agents, pandemic influenza, and emerging infectious diseases. BARDA is part of the National Institutes of Health. contracts with companies to develop and commercialize potential countermeasures. These contracts specify development activities for the company to perform and may extend multiple years. The Project BioShield Act ( P.L. 108-276 ) established a special process and funding mechanism through which the HHS Secretary may obligate funds to procure countermeasures that still need up to 10 more years of development. Up to half of the total amount of the Project Bio Shield contract may be paid out for theCompany meeting specified developmental milestones. The Medical Countermeasures Innovation Act of 2016 would change the manner in which the federal government supports the development and procurement of medical countermeasures against CBRN agents. Section 2 of S. 2055 would require the HHS Secretary to provide "timely and accurate recommended" guidelines for using the medical countermeasure in the Strategic National Stockpile. Currently, HHS has two separate mechanisms to support CBRNcountermeasure advanced development and commercialization: (1) countermeasures advanced development contracts and (2) Project BioShield acquisition contracts. report to "appropriate committees of Congress" within "30 days" when the amount available for Project BioShield procurements falls below $1.5 billion. This bill would change that requirement to specify the recipients of the report as the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions and the House Committee on Appropriations. Section 3 would move contracting authority for ProjectBioShield and BARDA advanced development from the Senate and House Appropriations committees to the Department of Health and Human Services. This report would be required by "March 1 of each year in which" the amount of money is available to be spent. ASPR to BARDA. Such a move was recommended by the Blue Ribbon Panel on Biodefense to "reduce unnecessary bureaucratic delays, improve efficiency and decision making" Section 4 would require ASPR to provide additional information in its "coordinated 5-year budget plan" and require that it be made publically available in "a manner that does not compromise national security" The budget plan would also need to consider the development of countermeasures and products for emerging infectious diseases that may present "a threat to the nation" "an independent, non-profit entity" to "foster and accelerate the development of medical countermeasures" This partner could provide business advice and use venture capital practices to invest in companies developing medical counter Measures. The U.S. intelligence community has successfully used a similar strategic investor model to address its unmet technology needs through In-Q-Tel. This bill would establish certain criteria for the partner, including prior experience in the intelligence community. The bill would also address unmet public health needs such as novel antimicrobials for multidrug resistant organisms. technology innovation and successful partnering with the federal government. The HHS Secretary acting through the BARDA Director would provide the entity with the government needs and requirements and a description of the work to be done under the agreement. The entity would be required to provide regular reports on the spending of funds provided by HHS and on progress meeting the identified needs. The bill would require the Government Accountability Office to evaluate this partnership four years after enactment. This authority would sunset on September 30, 2022. Section 6 would remove the current need for the President to approve use of the funds. of the Project BioShield special reserve fund. The Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense recommended this change to streamline the ProjectBioShield contracting process. Other than the provisions relating to Food and Drug Administration priority review, the 21 st Century Cures Act contains no comparable provisions to S. 2055 as reported. This section would also specify the congressional committees that HHS must notify of a decision to use Project Bio Shield funds as the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 (PDUFA), FDA agreed to specific goals for improving the drug review time. FDA created a two-tiered system of review times: Standard Review and Priority Review. Compared with the amount of time standard review generally takes (approximately 10 months), a Priority Review designation means FDA's goal is to take action on an application within 6 months. Currently, FDA has two authorized priority review voucher programs (the rare pediatric diseasepriority review program, and the tropical disease priority review program) a sponsor of an approved new drug or biological product to be used for the priority review of another application. Section 7 of this bill would add a new FFDCA section 565A, "Priority Review to Encourage Treatments for Agents that Present National Security Threats" This section would establish a new priority review voucher program, funded by user fees, to provide a transferable voucher. The purpose of thepriority review drug voucher programs is to incentivize development of new treatment for diseases that may otherwise not attract development interest. specified conditions, to a sponsor of an approved new human drug product application. This section defines a "material threat medical countermeasure application" as a human drug application "to prevent or treat harm from a biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agent identified as a material threat" under the Public Health Service Act. It can be used for the priority review of another application, among other things, to prevent "adverse health consequences or death and may be caused by administering a drug, or biological product" Congress has had a long-standing interest in developing the future biomedical research workforce. Recent concerns have focused on ways to reduce the time between when young investigators complete their training and when they receive their first independent NIH research grant. The NIH has created a number of initiatives that strive to shorten this time, in part, to attempt to better retain young investigators in biomedical research. Section 8 of this bill would require GAO to report on the effectiveness of the priority review voucher program. There is no comparable provision in the House bill. Section 3 of S. 2014 would consolidate existing NIH intramural and extramural loan repayment programs. Section 1042 of H.R. 6 would require the NIH Director to submit to Congress a report on NIH efforts "to attract, retain and develop emerging scientists" Section 1041 would authorize a new extural NIH loan repayment program that would provide not more than $50,000 of loan repayment benefits annually. The Senate bill would also increase the amounts that could be repaid under existing loan programs from $35,000 to $ 50,000. The Senate bill would amend Section 402 of the PHS Act by adding a new subsection (m), which describes a strategic plan for NIH. The NIH Strategic Plan would identify research priorities, such as advancement of treatment, cure and prevention of health conditions. The research strategy would address the disease burden in the United States, including rare diseases, and the many factors that contribute to health disparities. In developing the strategic plan, the NIH Director would be required to ensure that maintaining the biomedical workforce, including participation of scientists from traditionally underrepresented groups, would remain a priority. priorities, would be required to assemble accurate data on study populations in clinical research. The data would have to be disaggregated by research area, condition, and disease categories and made publically available on the NIH website. Section 5 would amend Part A of Title IV of the PHSA, adding a new Section 404M, "Research Related to Sexual and Gender Minority Populations" Section 8 would require the Secretary, not later than 90 days after enactment, to establish a Task Force on Research Specific to Pregnant and Lactating Women. of biomedical and behavioral research, and details of all the research activities conducted or supported by the ICs of NIH. The Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) is "a cooperative initiative among 10 federal agencies and 119 institutional recipients of federal funds" In 2005 and 2012, FDP conducted surveys of principal investigators of federally funded projects to determine the impact of federal regulations and requirements on the research process. In both surveys, researchers reported spending 57% of their time engaged in research. The National Academies sponsored the FDP. and 43% of their time in completing pre- and post-award requirements. The most commonly experienced administrative responsibilities included those related to federal project finances, personnel, and effort reporting. For researchers engaged in projects that required human or animal subjects, the related Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) requirements were by far the most time-consuming. Other areas viewed as particularly time- consuming were those involving clinical trials, subcontracts, and cross-agency differences. the President and the Directors of the other NIH Institutes are appointed by the Secretary. Each NIH Institute Director reports directly to the NIH Director. Section 202 of the Labor/HHS/ED Appropriations Act, 1993 ( P.L. 102-394 ), states at the end of the section that the payment of compensation to consultants or individual scientists appointed for limited periods of time is "not to exceed the per diem rate equivalent to the maximum rate payable for senior-level positions," which is not less than 120% of the minimum rate of basic pay payable for GS–15. greater than the rate of basic pay payable for level III of the Executive Schedule" Section 2 of S. 2742 would amend Section 403(a) of the PHSA to replace the biennial reporting requirement of the NIH Director with a triennial requirement. The section would add new, and clarify existing, reporting requirements, including a description of intra-NIH activities and funding made available for conducting and supporting research that involves collaboration between an IC and one or more other ICs. Section 3 includes a series of requirements that would address the administrative burden on researchers funded by NIH. other federal agencies. The bill would direct the Secretary, within two years of enactment, to lead a review by research funding agencies of all financial conflict-of-interest regulations and policies. Second, it would require the NIH Director to implement measures to reduce the administrative burdens experienced by primary NIH grant awardees related to monitoring grant sub-recipients. Third, the Secretary would be required to evaluate financial expenditure reporting procedures and requirements for NIH funding recipients and take appropriate action. federal agencies would be reviewed by the Secretary. to avoid duplication of effort and minimize burden to funding recipients. Within two years of enactment, the Secretary would have to complete a review of regulations and policies for the care and use of laboratory animals. The Secretary would be required to clarify the applicability of OMB Uniform Guidance requirements regarding documentation of personnel expenses for entities receiving HHS grants. Finally, within one year of enacting the bill, the OMB Director would be needed to establish a system for documenting personnel expenses in the federal government. a Research Policy Board, consisting of up to10 federal and 9 to 12 non-federal members, as specified. The board would have to make recommendations on harmonizing regulations and policies to minimize administrative burden across federal research agencies. Within two years of enactment, and once thereafter, the board would has to submit a report to specified offices in OMB, the heads of relevant federal departments and agencies, and specified House and Senate committees. The report would provide information on the effects of regulations related to federal research requirements. recommendations on scientific research policy, including regulatory benefits and burdens. The board would sunset on September 30, 2020. Within four years of enactment, GAO would be required to conduct an evaluation of board activities regarding its purpose and responsibilities and submit a report to Congress. Section 5 would modify or eliminate a number of different NIH reporting requirements. It would require the heads of each IC to submit to the NIH Director a report on the amount of funding made available for conducting or supporting research that involves collaboration between a given IC and at NIH. least one other IC. This information would be included in the triennial report required by Section 403(a) as amended by Section 2 of S. 2742. Section 5 also would (1) eliminate an annual reporting requirement regarding the number of experts and consultants whose services are used by NIH; (2) make a minor modification to the doctoral degree reporting requirement; and (3) change the NCATS annual report to a biennial report. The report on Centers of Excellence would also be eliminated. Section 10 of S. 2742 would amend Section 405 of the PHSA. It would require that Directors of ICs be appointed by the NIH Director. The term of office for the director of an IC would be five years. There would be no limit to the number of terms served. The Director of the National Cancer Institute would continue to beappointed by the President. The director of the NIH would be reappointed at the end of a five-year term. The National Institute on Nursing Research biennial report. It would require that, if the office of a director of an IC becomes vacant before the end of a five-year term, the director appointed to fill the vacancy begin a new five- year term. The compensation limitations in Section 202 of the Labor/HHS/ED Appropriations Act, 1993, would be removed. Each current IC Director would be deemed to be appointed for a five year term as of the date of enactment, and the NIH Director could terminate the appointment prior to end of the term. related to time-limited appointments of consultants and individual scientists, would not apply to directors appointed under this new authority. The Reducing Administrative Burdens of Researchers provision in H.R. 6 Section 1023 is comparable to Section 3 of S. 2742. The House provision would require the NIH Director to implement measures to reduce the administrative burden on NIH-funded researchers, taking into account the recommendations of the NIH Scientific Management Review Board, the National Academy of Sciences, and the Faculty Burden Survey conducted by the Federal Demonstration Partnership. the NIH Director would be required to submit a report to Congress on the measures that have been implemented to reduce the administrative burden on NIH-funded researchers. The Increasing Accountability at the National Institute of Health provision in H.R. 6 Section 1022 is comparable to Section 10 of S. 2742. Although they use slightly different language, they achieve the same goals. The House provision would remove compensation limitations for consultants and individual scientists (not just NIH IC Directors) as stipulated by Section 202 of the Labor/HHS/ED Appropriations Act, 1993. Section 4 would amend Section 301(a) of the Public Health Service through the Secretary of Health and Human Services. It requires the Secretary to "conduct in the Service, and encourage, cooperate with, and render assistance to other appropriate public authorities, scientific institutions, and scientists" As part of these authorities, the Secretary is authorized to make available substances and living organisms for biomedical and behavioral research. Section 4 would also amend Section 302(a), which would make the Secretary responsible for the National Institutes of Health. the PHSA to allow the Secretary, where research substances and living organisms are made available to researchers through contractors, to direct the contractors to collect payments. These amounts would be credited to the appropriations accounts that incurred the costs of making the substances and organisms available. In 1986, in order to stabilize the pediatric vaccine market, Congress waived the liability of manufacturers (in most cases) and established the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) There are no comparable provisions in H.R. 6. The list of covered vaccine types and associated compensable injuries and time frames (called the "Injury Table") was provided in law. An exception is made under current law for new vaccines that are routinely recommended by CDC for use in children, which are automatically included in the Injury Table. In 2013, the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines (ACCV), which advises on the VICP, informed the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services of its new policy on vaccine injuries. the Secretary that current VICP authority may discourage the growing use of vaccines for pregnant women. The law does not allow for addition of such vaccines to the Injury Table if they are not also recommended for children. Section 6 of S. 2742 would require the Secretary to incorporate into the list of covered vaccines any vaccine recommended by CDC for routine use in pregnant women, using the rulemaking process to establish covered injuries and related matters. It also would clarify injury to an infant born to a woman who was vaccinated during pregnancy. that both the woman and a child or children in utero when the vaccine was administered would be eligible for compensation. A vaccine may be both a commercial product and a public good. Congress has established several federal payment mechanisms and health insurance coverage requirements to support the production and use of vaccines in the United States. Some of these incentives are tied to recommendations of CDC and/or its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) In contrast to FDA, which licenses vaccines when they are shown to be safe and Vaccine manufacturers have an interest in understanding the factors considered by ACIP and CDC, as well as FDA, in making vaccine use and licensing decisions. Section 7 of S. 2742 does not explicitly require that CDC personnel meet with vaccine developers. It does, however, require the CDC Director to ensure that CDC centers and offices coordinate their vaccine program and policy efforts, including consultations with stakeholders. The CDC may recommend routine use of a vaccine for only a subset of the population for whom FDA has licensed its use. The provision also would require HHS to report to Congress on ways to promote innovation in the development of vaccines against infectious diseases. The Secretary may consult with specified stakeholders, including vaccine developers, in producing this report. Section 2143 would require CDC personnel to meet with vaccine developers regarding their vaccine products that are either licensed by FDA or for which a developer intends to seek licensure. The stated purpose is for CDC to share with developers information about epidemiology and related matters that could be used to develop new vaccines. Section 2142 would require the CDC Director to review ACIP processes, evaluation criteria, and consistency in issuing recommendations. H.R. 6 also includes a provision (Section 2141) that would expedite ACIP's consideration of certain vaccines. There is no comparable provision in S. 2742 . Sponsors of clinical trials for drugs, biologics, and vaccines would have to inform the sponsor's vaccine research and development plan. The section specifies types of information that may be shared, deadlines, representation at meetings. Under Section 402(j) of the PHS Act, those responsible for specified clinical trials of FDA-regulated products have been required to submit registration information to ClinicalTrials.gov. HHS published a proposed rule to clarify and expand requirements for the submission of clinical trial registration and results information. Section 8 of S. 2742 would add new language requiring the NIH Director to inform responsible parties of the option to request that information for a medical device clinical trial be publically posted prior to the date of clearance or approval. and in collaboration with the FDA Commissioner, to submit to Congress a report on registered clinical trials. The Secretary would be required to submit an initial report not later than two years after the compliance date of the final rule implementing Section 402(j) of the PHSA. Two follow-up reports would be needed, which include information on actions taken to enforce compliance with the ClinicalTrials.gov reporting requirements. Section 1101 and Section 1121 of H.R. 6 are comparable to S. 2742 . S. 2742 focuses on compliance with the reporting requirements. House provisions address public access to, and research on, the information in ClinicalTrials.gov. Section 1101 of H.R. 6 would add new language to Section 402(j) of the PHS Act ("Expanded Clinical Trial Registry Data Bank") It would require the NIH Director to ensure that the registry and results data bank is easily used by the public. It would also require that information is submitted in a standardized format, including certain specified data. terminologies and code sets are used, to the extent possible, to facilitate electronic data matching. Within 90 days of enactment, the Secretary would be required to seek the advice of relevant stakeholders and experts on enhancements to the clinical trial registry data bank that are necessary to implement the provision. Section 1121 of H.R. 6 would instruct the Secretary to enter into a seven-year cooperative agreement, contract, or grant—the Clinical Trial Data System Agreement—with one or more. The Secretary wouldbe required to begin implementation of the provision within 18 months of enactment. eligible entities (i.e., tax-exempt academic institutions) to implement a pilot program to enable registered users to conduct further research on reported clinical trial data. Eligible entities seeking funding would have to submit an application that contains certain specified information, including a description of the system the eligible entity will use to store and maintain such data. The eligible entity must also prove that it will allow onlyregistered users to access and use de-identified clinical trialData. The application must also include evidence demonstrating the ability to compile clinical trial Data in standardized formats. of the eligible entity to ensure that registered users disseminate the results of their research; and evidence demonstrating that the eligible entities has a proven track record of protecting confidential data. FDA uses the data from clinical trials to determine whether to approve a manufacturer's application for marketing a medical product. Clinical trials are conducted in three phases. Phase I trials try to determine dosing, document how a drug is metabolized. Phase II trials document how the drug is administered. Phase III trials document the drug's effects on the body.  Phase II trials include more participants (about 100-300) who have the disease or condition that the product potentially could treat. Researchers seek to gather further safety data and preliminary evidence of the drug's beneficial effects (efficacy) Sometimes Phase II clinical trials are divided into Phase IIA (to assess dosing requirements) and Phase IIB (to study efficacy) If the Phase II trial is successful, the drug could be approved for use in the U.S. and Europe. If the drug is not approved, the product could be withdrawn from the market. In Phase III trials, the drug is studied in a larger number of participants with the disease. This phase further tests the product's effectiveness, monitors side effects and compares the product to a standard treatment. As more and more participants are tested over longer periods of time, the less common side effects are more likely to be revealed. Under current current guidelines, the risks are considered acceptable, given the observed efficacy and the severity of the disease, according to the drug's manufacturer, AstraZeneca. The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) may develop and provide infrastructure and resources for all phases of clinical trials research. NCATS may support clinical trial activities through the end of Phase IIB for a treatment for a rare disease or condition if it gives public notice for a period of at least 120 days of NCATS's intention to support the clinical trial. No public or private organization provides credible written intent to NCATS that it will support the trials through Phase IIA. the organization has timely plans to further the clinical trial activities or conduct clinical trials of a similar nature beyond Phase IIA; and (3) NCATS ensures that support of the clinicaltrial activities in Phase IIB will not increase the federal government's liability beyond the award value of the center's support. Section 11 of S. 2742 would extend NCATS's authority to support clinical trial Activities through the end of Phase IIb. The Senate passed the bill with a vote of 50-0. bill would add material to the NCATS annual/biennial report regarding methods and tools developed since the last report. The next NCATS report, following enactment, would include a complete list of all such tools developed by research supported by NCATS. The NDCATS Phase IIB Restriction provision in H.R. 6 Section 1027 is comparable to S. 2742 . The House provision would extend NCATS's authority to support clinical trial activities through the end of Phase IIA. Section 452 of the PHSA established the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research (the Center) within the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (the Institute) at NIH. It also required the NIH Director to create a Medical rehabilitation Coordinating Committee and a National Advisory Board on Medical rehabilitation Research. The Director of the Institute—in collaboration with the Director of NIH—conducts and disseminates research, and disseminate information, on the rehabilitation of individuals with physical disabilities. The exception is for treatment of a rare disease or condition through the end of Phase III. the Center, the Coordinating Committee, and the Advisory Board—is required to develop, and periodically revise and update, a comprehensive plan for medical rehabilitation research. The research plan would have to include goals and objectives for such research. Within 30 days of revising and updating the plan, the Director of the Center would be required to transmit the plan to the President, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. In addition, S. 800 would require the Secretary, with the other federal agencies, to review their medical rehabilitationResearch programs and take action to avoid duplication. S. 849 would add a new PHSA Section 399S-1, "Advancing Research for Neurological Diseases" It would authorize the HHS Secretary to improve the collection of data on neurological diseases. H.R. 6 would define medical rehabilitation research as "the science of mechanisms and interventions that prevent, improve, restore, or replace lost, underdeveloped, or deteriorating function" The PHSA does not explicitly authorize or require surveillance of neurological diseases in general, although the Secretary may conduct such activities under general authorities. National Neurological Diseases Surveillance System to track the epidemiology of neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. Required and optional data elements are the same as in the Senate bill. The Secretary would be required to make information and analysis in the surveillance system available, subject to HIPAA privacy and security protections, to the public, including researchers. The provision would authorize the appropriation of $5 million for each of fiscal years 2016 through 2020. The Silvio O. Conte Senior Biomedical Research Service. SBRS is a special hiring mechanism used by the HHS Secretary to attract and retain accomplished scientists to work in Public Health Service (PHS) agencies. It is not subject to civil service requirements under Title 5 of the U.S. Code. SBRS requirements are as prescribed in law and regulation (42 C.F.R. Part 24). Currently, SBRS is limited to 500 members, who are accomplished doctoral-level scientists in biomedical research or clinical research evaluation. The rate of pay may not exceed $100,000. that for Level I of the Executive Schedule (currently about $206,000 per year) unless approved by the President. The Secretary may contribute up to 10% of a Service member's pay to that person's already established retirement system. The provision would rename the SBRS as the Silvio O. Conte Senior Biomedical Research and Biomedical Product Assessment Service (the Service) It would increase the number of authorized members to 2,000, and would add "biomedical product assessment" as a desired field of expertise. not required to reduce the number of employees serving in other HHS employment systems. The provision would require the Secretary to appoint experts to agencies within HHS. It also would authorize the appointment of persons who hold "a master's level degree in engineering, bioinformatics, or a related or emerging field" It would increase the upper pay rate limit to that of the President (currently $400,000 per year) but would eliminate the authority to reduce other HHS employees' jobs. It would also broaden the current requirement for doctoral-level members. to contribute to a member's preexisting retirement system. The House bill contains a similar provision (Section 2281) that would also rename the SBRS the Silvio O. Conte Senior Biomedical Research and Biomedical Product Assessment Service. Unlike the Senate bill, the House bill would eliminate the mention of a specific number of authorized Servicemembers. Finally, the provision would require GAO to study the changes to the Service and their effects on HHS departments and agencies. the number of employees serving in other HHS employment systems to offset the number in the Service. Title 5 of the U.S. Code provides the broad framework of requirements under which many federal employees are hired. Some subsets of employees are hire under alternative government-wide or agency-specific authorities. Numerous hiring authorities target scientists and other qualified experts. The House bill would require the Secretary to report on the HHS website regarding the changes to the Service and whether they "have improved the ability of the [FDA] to hire and retain qualified experts" other technical workers, for whom federal agencies such as FDA compete with the private sector and nonfederal public employers. For example, FFDCA Section 714 authorizes the Secretary to appoint employees to positions in FDA to perform, administer, or support activities related to review of medical device applications and human generic drugs. The House bill contains a comparable provision ( H.R. 6 , Title II, Subtitle P, Section 2285, "Hiring Authority for Scientific, Technical, and Professional Personnel" positions" in the competitive service "without regard to the provisions of title 5, United States Code" The House provision specifies that these positions would be within FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Like the Senate bill, the House provision would allow the HHS Secretary to determine pay (not to exceed the annual rate of pay of the President) for the purposes of retaining qualified employees, notwithstanding certain General Schedule pay rate requirements. The provision would also allow the Secretary to set the salary for certain positions. FDA regulatory authority over medical product safety and effectiveness covers drugs, biological products, and medical devices. The agency generally divides responsibilities for the review of marketing applications in its product-centered offices. The House provision would require the Secretary to submit a report to Congress on workforce planning and certain specified elements with regard to the FDA. Unlike the Senate bill, the House provision wouldn't require a GAO study with regards to FDA workforce. The Senate bill would not require aGAO study on FDA workforce planning. The Obama Administration has proposed an Oncology Center of Excellence to streamline collaboration across FDA's Human Drugs, Biologics, and Devices and Radiological Health programs. According to the FY2017 Congressional Justification, "With the continued development of companion diagnostic tests and the use of combinations of drugs and biologics to treat cancer using methods developed through the science of precision medicine, to most benefit those affected, FDA needs to take an integrated approach" The Center for Devices andRadiological Health reviews premarket approval applications for approval and 510(k) notifications. Some groups have suggested that such pilots could also be done in other areas (e.g., cardiology, neurology, and infectious disease) This provision would add a new FFDCA Section 1014, "Food and Drug Administration Intercenter Institutes" This would require the Secretary to establish one or more "Intercenter Institutes," for a major disease area(s) The proposal is specific to cancer, but there has arguably also been an increase in the number and complexity of diagnostics and therapeutics for other diseases. Such institutes would be responsible for coordinating activities applicable to specific disease area(s) H.R. 2700 would require the Secretary to establish at least one institute within one year of enactment of the bill. It would also require a public comment period while each institute is established. The bill is expected to be signed into law by the end of the first quarter of 2014. It is currently under consideration in the Senate and the House of Representatives, both of which are expected to vote on the bill this week. No comparable provision in H.R. 6 is being implemented. This provision also would allow the Secretary to terminate any such institute if the Secretary determines that it is no longer benefitting the public health. Following allegations of misspent funds during a 2010 General Services Administration meeting held in Las Vegas, the Office of Management and Budget imposed restrictions on conference travel for federal employees. The memorandum directed agencies, beginning in FY2013, to spend at least 30% less than what was spent in FY2010 on travel expenses. Senior-level agency approval is required for all conferences sponsored by an agency where the conference expenses to the agency exceed $100,000. Agencies are prohibited from spending more than $500,000 on a single conference. However, this restriction may be waived if the agency head "determines that exceptional circumstances exist" Under the Senate provision, if attendance at a scientific meeting is directly related to the professional duties of scientific or medical professionals of the agency.level of spending each year through FY 2016. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), then the meetings would not be considered to be conferences for the purposes of federal reporting requirements. Each HHS operating division would be required to post on their website an annual report on scientific meeting attendance and related travel spending for each fiscal year. The NIH travel (Title I, Subtitle B, Section 1025) and the enabling FDA scientific engagement (Title II, Sub Title P, Section 2282) provisions in H.R. 6 would be included. H.R. 6 and S. 2700 express a sense of Congress that participation in or sponsorship of scientific conferences and meetings is essential to the mission of NIH and FDA. FFDCA Section 770, as added by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA, P.L. 110-85 ), created the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the Food & Drug Administration. Its duties cover activities such as identifying and then prioritizing unmet needs; awarding grants or entering into other agreements with scientists. and industry; holding meetings and publishing information and data for use by FDA and others; and taking action to obtain patents and licensing of inventions. It is led by a Board of Directors, four of whom are ex officio members, and nine from candidates provided by the National Academy of Sciences. Section 770 specifies the number of members to be appointed representing each type of group, and requires that the ex-officio members ensure specific expertise among the members. The group is made up of members from patient and consumer advocacy groups, professional scientific and medical societies, and trade organizations. provision would amend FFDCA Section 770 to change the membership of the Board of Directors. It would limit to 30% of the membership "representatives of the general pharmaceutical, device, food, cosmetic, and biotechnology industries" The obligation to ensure specific expertise among the members would be broadened to rest with all members of the board, not only ex officio appointees. That broader group would also decide the size of theBoard of Directors and who gets to appoint new members. Each board member's term of office would last for four years. Initially appointed board members' terms would expire on a staggered basis, as determined by the ex officio members. The provision would remove the salary cap of the foundation's Executive Director, which is now set at the compensation of the Executive Director. The provisions would also add that for the additional board members appointed pursuant to S. 2700 , Section 6, the terms of office for the initially appointed persons can expire onA staggered basis. Current requirement is that funds received from the Treasury be held in separate accounts. The provision would change the requirement, so that funds would be "managed as individual programmatic funds, according to best accounting practices" The House bill provision ( H.R. 6 , Title II, Subtitle P, Section 2283, "Reagan-Udall Foundation for the Food and Drug Administration") is the same as the Senate bill. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) was enacted in 1986. 1980 and amended in 1995, established the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) Congress required that agencies seek OIRA permission before collecting information from the public. The PRA requires that federal agencies receive clearance from OIra before requesting most types of information. PRA clearance is required when standardized information is collected from 10 or more respondents within a period of time. The first of 11 stated purposes was to "minimize the paperwork burden for individuals ... and other persons resulting from the collection of information by and for the Federal Government" 12-month period. PRA does not apply to certain types of scientific research, including collections that are neither sponsored nor conducted by the agency. The Exemption for the National Institutes of Health from the Paperwork Reduction Act Requirements provision (Title I, Subtitle B, Section 1024) is comparable to S. 2700. It would amend 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 to exempt the NIH from the PRA requirements for certain scientific research collections during the conduct of NIH research. Congress has required the Secretary to submit specified reports to Congress or to contract with other entities (e.g., the Institute of Medicine [IOM]), to conduct specified studies. For example, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA, P.L. 110-85 ) required FDA to take several actions regarding how it informs the public, expert committees, and others about agency actions and plans, as well as information the agency has developed or gathered about drug safety and effectiveness. Other amendments to the FFDCA have imposed additional requirements upon the Secretary or the FDA. This provision would remove the following: Section 505(k)(5), which required the Secretary to report to Congress not later than two years after the enactment of the FDAAA in 2007 on certain FDA procedures addressing post market safety issues. Section 505A(p) required the. Secretary to contract with the IOM to conduct a study, which was further specified. in this section. The provision would also remove the requirement that the Secretary report to the FDA not later. than three years after enactment of. the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act of 2007. There is no comparable provision in H.R. 6 . FFDCA Section 505 and accompanying regulations provide the framework for FDA's approval of sponsors' drug marketing applications. For a drug whose active ingredient has never been FDA-approved, the law requires the sponsor to submit a new drug application that includes data to provide evidence of the drug's safety and effectiveness for its intended use. The House provision would add a new Section 505H, which, like the Senate bill, would address the data requirements in a supplemental NDA.

Summary:
USDA’s CBAs provide services such as farm loans and conservation assistance. Under the E- File Act, these agencies were required to establish an electronic filing and retrieval system. The law further mandated that by June 20, 2002, agricultural producers be able to file paperwork electronically with USDA if they choose to do so. By the end of December 2000, none of the 100-plus RD forms that the CBAs expected to have deployed on the Web site by the deadline were available. We reviewed measures being taken by the department to implement the Freedom to E-File Act. On November 15, 2000, we briefed your staff on the results of our review up to that point. We performed follow-up work to update USDA’s progress implementing the act through December 31, 2000. The results of all of our work are summarized in this report. As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30. days from its date. At that time, we will send copies to Representative Eva Clayton, Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Department Operations, Oversight, Nutrition, and Forestry, House Committee on Agriculture. We will also send them to Senator Richard Lugar, Chairman, and Senator Tom Harkin, Ranking Member, Senate committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry. We are also sending them to Representative Larry Combest, Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, and Representative Charles Stenholm, Ranking minority Member, House committee on agriculture. and Representative Janice Schakowski, Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Government Efficiency, Financial Management and Intergovernmental Relations. We will also send copies to the Honorable Ann M. Veneman, Secretary of Agriculture; the Hon honorable Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr., Director, Office of Management and Budget; and other interested parties. Copies will also be made available to others upon request. Should you have any questions on matters discussed in this report, please contact me at (202) 512-6257 or Stephen A. Schwartz, Senior Assistant Director, at (Washington, D.C.) 512-6213. Conservation Service (NRCS), and Rural Development (RD) mission area--hereafter referred to collectively as County- based Agencies (CBAs), and the Risk Management Agency (RMA) to establish an electronic filing and retrieval system. Provides separate requirements for the CBAs and RMA. an Internet-based system enabling agricultural producers to access all forms and shall submit to Congress a report that describes the progress made. Not later than June 20, 2002, the system shall be expanded to enable producers toaccess and file all forms. Congress a plan to allow agricultural producers the option of obtaining, over the Internet from approved insurance providers, all forms and other information and filing all paperwork required for participation electronically. Not later than December 1, 2001, RMA should complete implementation of the plan. RMA administers the federal crop insurance program, under which insurance policies are sold and serviced by private companies to help protect agricultural producers against crop losses due to drought, flooding, and other unavoidable causes. By 2003, federal agencies provide the public, where practicable, the option to submit, maintain, or disclose information. information--such as employment records, tax forms, and loan applications-- electronically, instead of on paper. On the basis of guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), agencies are preparing plans for implementing GPEA, including the use of electronic signatures. Secretary issued a memorandum to the undersecretaries for the affected agencies, requiring that one shared plan be developed and implemented to meet E- File Act requirements and the plan be submitted to Office of Chief Information Officer (OCIO) no later than September 30, 2000. area leaders with collective responsibility for developing and implementing e-file activities and gave OCIO the role of coordinating/facilitating e- file implementation planning.

E-File Act requires USDA to continue providing services in the traditional way to customers who choose not to use the Internet. CBAs must support dual service delivery functions--one electronic and one paper-based. USDA has not yet developed and documented a comprehensive e-file implementation plan. E-file Act provides that the Secretary is to reserve, from applicable accounts of the CBAs, not more than $3 million for fiscal year 2001 and $2 million for each subsequent fiscal year. Decisions on use of these accounts and funding are still pending.

Summary:
User financing is one approach to financing federal programs or activities. User fees assign part or all of the costs of the benefits and services derived from these programs and activities to readily identifiable recipients. Some excise taxes, however, can also be described as a form of user financing. For example, the excise taxes on tobacco products can be used to fund the federal government's health care program for the elderly, the disabled, and the elderly in nursing homes. The federal government can also use excise taxes to fund its health care programs. on motor fuels, tires, and heavy vehicles accrue to the Highway Trust Fund, from which Congress appropriates funds for the interstate highway system, mass transit, and transportation projects. Similarly, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) operations are funded in part by excise taxes assessed on airline tickets, aviation fuel, and certain cargo. Both the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-25 provide that agencies review their user fees biennially. could charge fees for any of its services, noting that if imposing such fees is prohibited or restricted by law, agencies will recommend legislative changes as appropriate. OMB encourages agencies to examine potential effects of design alternatives when reviewing and proposing changes to regulations, even when the regulations are mandated by statute. The user fees considered in this report, are assessed under specific statutory authority and levied on air and sea passengers, vessel operators, or shippers (see app. II for a summary of the fees by payer). The fees vary in the way they are The passenger and vessel inspection processes in both the air and sea environments have been largely consolidated within CBP. The legacy fees supporting these inspections are still governed by separate, dissimilar authorizing legislation. APHIS uses the Passenger and Vessel Inspection System to assess the effectiveness of the inspection process. The agency also uses the Air and Sea Inspection System (ASIS) to assess how well the inspections are carried out. The ASIS is a joint venture between CBP and the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). federal regulatory process to propose rate increases. Congress has delegated to APHIS the authority and responsibility to set and adjust AQI fee rates to match program costs over time. In contrast, both the immigration and customs fee rates are set in statute. These fees can only recoup authorized program costs to the extent that total reimbursable program costs do not exceed the rate caps prescribed in statute, according to the AQI statute. The Secretary invites comments on its proposals and implementing regulations via a public notice and comment in the Federal Register. In 2006 we reported that financial management issues at CBP and APHIS adversely affect the AQI program’s ability to perform border inspections. In fiscal years 2003 through 2005, user fees were not sufficient to cover program costs. CBP was unable to provide information on the actual costs of CBP’S portion of the AQi program broken out by user-fee type. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has broad discretion to prescribe and collect fees to cover the cost of providing agricultural quarantine and inspection services. In 2007, APHIS and CBP agreed on a common set of assumptions used to forecast the cost of AQI activities. The fee rates are now set to recover all program costs except for certain indirect and imputed costs, such as employee retirement benefits. We have previously found that OMB Circular No. A-25 guidance and USDA policy require the inclusion of indirect andimputed costs in setting full-cost recovery fees. Unless otherwise specified in statute such collections should be deposited in.passengers or vessels. APHIS does not include these costs when calculating the fee rate. APHIS estimates that these indirect and imputed costs for the AQI user fee program totaled approximately $18.9 million in fiscal year 2006. The Department of the Treasury’s general fund is the source of most of the fee collections. The AQI authorizing statute does not authorize APH IS to spend fee collections on such expenses. The agency does not list these costs in the Federal Register when proposing rate increases. immigration inspection fees are structured to recover partial costs. The two statutes actually prescribe an exact amount in law to be charged for their respective inspection services. The customs statute further restricts cost recovery by limiting the set of activities for which collections may reimburse appropriations. The immigration statute makes immigration user fee collections available to refund any appropriation for expenses incurred in the course of an inspection. The fees are not equal or be reasonably related to the cost of services, but they are set to a certain amount. They are meant to limit cost recovery to a sum certain. In fiscal year 2006, commercial vessel customs inspections fee collections covered about 66 percent of related program costs. DHS does not know the portion of total immigration inspection costs covered by immigration fee collections. Since the fees can pay for only some inspection activities and only under certain circumstances, ensuring proper use of fee collections can require detailed cost data. For example, to be reimbursed for time spent on. immigration inspection and pre-inspection services as well as certain other expenses, at least one of which is not directly related to immigration inspections. authorized activities for various fees, CBP must track the time spent on these activities. Because the inspection processes have been largely combined but the separate distinct fees supporting these activities are not uniform, correctly tracking which activities can be reimbursed by which fees can be difficult. In general, the three fees are not levied uniformly, and sometimes involve cross-subsidization (see table 2). For example, although air passengers are charged an AQI fee, sea passengers (generally cruise ship passengers) are not. According to CBP data, fiscal year 2006 CBP costs for the AQI commercial vessel inspections were approximately $35 million. inspector is working overtime. According to CBP officials, collections for reimbursable overtime agriculture inspections total about $1.2 million annually. Although vessels must be charged for overtime inspections, AQI regulations explicitly prohibit charging for similar overtime inspections of aircraft when passengers have already paid an AQI fee for that flight. CBP has limited authority to charge for overtime for customs inspection services, officials say. Some payers told us they often do not know whether or when they will incur overtime fees and what the charges will be. increase revenue, decrease administrative costs, and improve CBP’s relations with the trade community. Ineffective and outdated collection methods for vessel inspection fees increase administrative costs for both agencies and payers. A lack of coordination between the Corps and CBP inhibits oversight of HMF payments for passenger vessels, domestic shipments, and shipments into foreign trade zones. Also, when theseHMF payments are late, CBP does not charge interest or penalties and is therefore not using an important tool to encourage timely payment. CBP uses to process the MPF as well as HMF assessed on imports. This system allows entry summaries to be electronically transmitted, validated, confirmed, corrected, and paid. The method of collecting the customs and AQI commercial vessel fees imposes unnecessary administrative costs on CBP and payers and may increase the likelihood of over- or underpayments. User fees function best when they minimize, to the extent practicable, administrative costs. Treasury’s Financial Management Service has made it a priority to increase the use of electronic collection methods for government collections. date, the commercial vessel fees may still only be paid in person by check or cash. Payers must retain each paper payment receipt and present them at each entry so that CBP can determine whether that particular vessel has reached the annual fee cap. If a payer misplaces the receipt proving that the vessel has reach the fee cap, the fee must be paid. The payer may request a refund if the receipt is later found, although several stakeholders told us this process is lengthy and burdensome. Some stakeholders and CBP field office staff expressed frustration. Customs vessel inspection fee rate increased without corresponding increase in the annual fee cap. CBP officers must be aware when processing payments that the 14th payment will be for a different amount than the typical fee rate. Insufficient coordination between CBP and the Corps inhibits CBP’s ability to ensure that certain HMF payments are properly made. Customs accepts electronic payment for fees along with customs duties, which are typically paid by an importer on behalf of a customs broker on the importer's behalf. Customs inspection-related activities that occur while a CBP officer is earning overtime or premium pay, or during preclearance, can be funded by the user fees. The same activities conducted during regular time cannot be funding by the fee. Not all customs inspection activities are reimbursable (i.e., can be covered by funds from the user fee account). Moreover, use of the customs vessel and sea passenger fee collections is not restricted to vessel. It is not limited to vessel collections. CBP officials said that since the events of September 11, 2001, the focus of merchandise processing has shifted toward security and away from the original focus on trade compliance. They said that certain activities associated with merchandise processing and performed by CBP officers are not reimbursable MPF activities. Rather, they may be used to reimburse authorized inspection activities conducted at air, sea, or land ports of entry. Similar alignment issues exist with the MPF. According to CBP officials, certain activities. including screening and inspecting conveyances (including nonintrusive searches), processing seized narcotics, and inspecting vessels and containers. Since 2003, HMF collections have significantly exceeded funds appropriated for harbor maintenance, resulting in a large and growing surplus in the trust fund. This may be inconsistent with users’ expectations of the fee’s purpose as laid out in statute and the principles of effective user fee design. According to stakeholders, this misalignment between fee collections and expenditures may be a breach of the user's expectations. The legislation governing the MPF should be explicitly consistent with CBP's mission, the authors say. Total collections grew 101 percent from $704 million to $1.416 billion from 2001 to 2007. Corps officials told us this was driven by the ad valorem nature of the fee. Annual harbor maintenance project expenditures, which are subject to annual appropriation, grew by more than 20 percent from 2001-2007. In 2001 HMF collections exceeded expenditures by about $44 million, and by 2007 that gap had grown to over $506 million (see fig. 4). There are several reasons why growth in collections has outpaced growth in expenditures. more slowly—from $660 million in 2001 to $910 million in 2007 (38 percent) The difference between the amount collected and the amount expended has led to a growing balance in the HMTF. Since 1996, the President has included in his annual budget requests and Congress has appropriated $3 million from the HM TF. Between fiscal years 2001 and 2007, the balance grew from $1.8 billion to $3.7 billion. Corps officials told us they expect it to reach $8 billion in fiscal year 2011 (see fig. 5). to compensate CBP for costs associated with collecting the fee. CBP finance officials told us that they estimate the annual cost of collecting the HMF to be approximately $2 million. Officials at the Corps and CBP were unable to explain why the President’s budget request for this activity was higher than the estimated cost. The Corps prepares an annual report to Congress on the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, which includes a substantive review of the fee, but does not include information on these costs. The HMTF is not the only fund for which revenues flow. in automatically from earmarked taxes or fees and spending must be appropriated. In the 1990s the Highway Trust Fund also built up a surplus. At the time, Congress and the President modified the discretionary spending caps to provide for a separate cap on highway funding. In 1998, Congress specified a more automatic link between spending from the highway Trust Fund and receipts into the Trust Fund. The experience with these annual adjustments, known as Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA), highlights some problems with such links. as the adjustments were positive—when receipts came in below estimated levels and would have resulted in an automatic cut in highway program funding levels, the cut was overridden. A different mechanism is used for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prescription drug user fee. If actual FDA fee collections are higher than the amount appropriated, FDA must adjust fee rates in a subsequent year to reduce its anticipated fee collections by that amount. Even if there were a tighter link between collections and expenditures, the HMTF should not necessarily aim for a zero balance. AQI fees are maintained with a reserve of approximately 3 months worth of program costs in case of emergency. According to APHIS, the reserve is necessary because the AQI program is funded solely through user fee collections. As with similar situations, deciding whether and how to link HMF collections with expenditures is complicated. On the one hand, there are good reasons to consider maintaining a positive balance in the trust fund. But on the other, it can be difficult to determine how to balance the fund. Hand: aligning collections and expenditures can promote economic efficiency and enhance stakeholder support for the fee. On the other hand, increased spending on harbors or reduced fee collections would increase the federal deficit, unless spending in other areas was decreased or other collections or revenues were increased. Hand: Providing guaranteed funding levels to any one activity in the budget protects that activity from competition with other areas for scarce resources and limits Congressional discretion to make trade-offs in spending priorities. Regardless of the approach taken, a reduction in fee receipts or an increase in appropriations—absent a change in appropriations —would increase the deficit. offsetting changes elsewhere—will increase the federal deficit. Despite large and growing balances in the harbor maintenance trust fund, there is a backlog of harbor maintenance, which can result in costly delays. A recent Corps analysis of the 59 busiest commercial federal channels in the U.S. found that harbor maintenance was lacking in many of the busiest channels. decisions about changing the HMF should consider its continued relevance and relative priority within the context of reexamining the base of all major federal spending and tax programs. found that the authorized depth was available in the middle of the channel only approximately 35 percent of the time in fiscal year 2005. Although ships continue to use these channels and harbors, not maintaining them to their justified design dimensions can cause problems. For example, according to Corps officials in one port we visited, some vessels are delayed because they have to wait for high tide in order to pass through the channels. They also reported instances where ships skipped a port of call altogether if such a delay was reported. would have caused the ship to miss its scheduled appointment at the Panama Canal. These types of disruptions affect both regional commerce and port profits. A 2007 report by the U.S. Committee on the Marine Transportation System (CMTS) found that vessels often deal with the challenges of poorly dredged and maintained channels and harbors by “light loading,” i.e., loading less cargo than their full capacity. This in turn increases shipping costs. If a port is not well maintained, it may lack the capacity to handle increasingly larger vessels and therefore lose business. The authorized depth of the Port of Georgetown is 27 feet, but the channel has silted in to 25 feet on numerous occasions over the past several years. With the channel at only 25 feet, a company bringing in rock for the regional construction industry can only bring in about 24,000 tons per vessel. They said that this “light-loading” of vessels significantly drives up its operating cost and impacts construction costs. The 2007 CMTS report found that channel at 27 feet was safe. limitations may lead to unsafe conditions and interaction with other vessels. A full oil tanker ran aground in East Rockaway, New York, in 2006 due in part to a lack of maintenance. Corps officials said the Corps now uses a performance-based budgeting model to set harbor maintenance priorities. As part of this effort, the Corps is developing a national estimate of the cost to make the 59 busiest channels available to commercial vessels and other vessels in the U.S., officials said. The cost of making the channels available is expected to be in the region of $1 billion. Without regular, substantive fee reviews, agencies, stakeholders, and Congress lack complete information about changing program costs. For example, CBP and APHIS report separately on the customs, immigration, and AQI vessel fees, and the reviews generally do not reflect input from the other. CBP’s review of the MPF does not detail program costs and project fee collections, or provide enough information to determine if the amount, structure, or authorized uses of the fee are being used. user fees represent a charge for a service or benefit received from a specific government program. Payers may expect a tight link between payments and services, including expectations about the quality of the related service. There are opportunities at the local level for payers to provide input on fees and the services they support. Ineffective communication may reduce stakeholder cooperation and support for the fees, contribute to misunderstandings and confusion about how the fees work and what activities they support, the report says.should be updated. Congress does not have a comprehensive view of the vessel and passenger AQI, customs, and immigration inspection fees. The agencies and Congress lack information on the total costs of the combined inspections. We have previously reported that agencies with shared responsibilities for common outcomes or related functions should reinforce agency accountability for collaborative efforts through common planning and reporting, the authors say. The challenges described in our previous work extend beyond air passenger inspections to other fees managed by the agency, they say. They say the agencies’ ability to obtain input from stakeholders about fees and the programs that they fund. information provided is not sufficient to project fee collections or to provide assurance that the amount of the fee is aligned with program costs. Without this information, CBP is not able to determine if the amount, structure, or authorized uses of thefee should be updated or to recommend changes to the fee statute. CBP has reliable information on the extent to which MPF collections cover the costs of related activities only for the past few years. These officials noted that as recently as 2003, cost calculations have included activities that are not covered by the fee. directly associated with processing cargo or that are covered by other fee programs. CBP cannot reliably project future MPF collections because the agency has not estimated the effects of exemptions, entries made through foreign trade zones, or changes in import demographics. Since fiscal year 2004 collections have increased relative to program costs and in fiscal years 2006 and 2007 collections exceeded costs by a total of approximately $221 million (see fig. 6). CBP data on MPF collection and program costs indicate that since fiscal year 2003 collections have been increasing. CBP’s most recent biennial report notes that a detailed analysis of the current and projected effects of MPF exemptions and an accurate cost estimate for processing merchandise is needed. CBP officials told us that they plan to conduct a detailed review of the MPF in the second phase of a three- phases review of user fees. Agencies can accommodate stakeholder input in various ways. We have previously reported on both the need to accommodate stakeholders input and how agencies can accommodate them. Some Corps and CBP officials have established successful, two-way communication practices at the local level. For example, some Corps division offices publicly post survey results and maps showing the controlling depth reports for local harbors and channels. One local Corps official said this practice encourages more dialogue with stakeholders, noting that they will e-mail the office to find out when highlighted areas will be dredged. Several of the CBP field offices hold regular meetings with port stakeholders to share information and address stakeholder concerns. formal vehicle for payers of the HMF and other port stakeholders to provide input to the Corps. The HMF authorizing legislation did not establish an HMF advisory committee, though it did establish an advisory committee for a similar program that funds new work construction and rehabilitation on inland waterways. The purpose of this Inland Waterways Users Board is to make recommendations on priorities and spending for inland waterway construction and Rehabilitation projects. As we have previously reported, both the customs and immigration passenger inspection programs are under review. fee statutes required the establishment of advisory committees consisting of industry representatives to advise the agency on issues related to inspection services, including fee levels. The committee members represent entities subject to the fees, including airlines, airports, cruise lines, and industry associations. We recently reported that stakeholders felt that the advisory committee provided only limited opportunities for substantive two-way communication. As a result, they said they lack data to support their concerns. We are happy to clarify that the committee meets biannually and that the fees are subject to change. necessary to know whether the passenger inspection fees are set fairly or accurately, or are being spent on the appropriate activities. Federal advisory committees play an important role in shaping public policy by providing advice on a wide array of issues. Their advice can enhance the quality and credibility of federal decision making. Despite the strengths associated with the federal advisory committees as a means to facilitate effective stakeholder input, agencies also need to be careful to maintain their mission to promote the public interest and take measures to safeguard against actual or perceived agency misconduct. Critics say giving the pharmaceutical industry a role in setting program performance goals creates conflicts of interest. Agencies also need to ensure that all stakeholders are given the opportunity to engage substantively. Some smaller businesses have raised concerns that FAA only consults with selected major airlines and manufacturers, ignoring commuter airlines and smaller businesses also affected by FAA regulations. Many of the stakeholders we spoke with said they were concerned that FAA was not doing enough to consult with smaller businesses and commuter airlines, as well as other stakeholders. that although the ad valorem structure of the HMF makes it relatively easy to administer, it raises concerns about equity. They noted there is no link between the value of their cargo and the depth or width of the harbor needed by the ship on which it is carried. For example, importers of high-value goods, such as natural gas and pharmaceuticals, told us they essentially pay a much greater share of dredging costs. Stakeholders said that a ship’s size and draft combined with harbor conditions drive harbor maintenance costs. Some stakeholders say the HMF fee structure does not reflect the individual dredging needs of ports. Other stakeholders noted that a benefit of the ad valorem structure is that it may better reflect the users’ ability to pay. The overall cost of moving goods through the nation’s marine transportation system is artificially high. On the other hand, applying the fee equally could reduce the cost of shipping goods through U.S. ports by as much as 50 percent, according to some estimates. to all eligible ports offers a relatively simple collection mechanism and helps to create a level playing field for all ports. Even so, officials from ports located near international borders told us the HMF disadvantages them relative to nearby foreign ports. For example, Seattle Port Authority officials consider theHMF to be a “punitive assessment” because they said it decreases Seattle’s competitiveness against Canadian ports (which do not charge the fee). These officials said that the Port of Vancouver actively promotes itself as not charging the HMf. Whether the fee is based on the value of the cargo (ad valorem) or on the size and draft of the ship is a separate decision from whether fees should vary by the dredging needs and condition of a given port. Congress could decide to impose a uniform fee structure at all ports even if it chooses to change the design of that fee from ad valorem to one based on a ship’s size or draft. Stakeholders expect that inspections will be conducted at all U.S. ports. Cruise lines, importers, and ships’ agents all said that delays for passenger and vessel inspections are costly to industry. One agent said that a 1-hour delay can cost a carrier $15,000 in longshoreman labor costs. Crew changes cannot occur until a vessel has cleared its immigration inspection. During this time, the ship must pay expenses for two crews. Stakeholders told us that when multiple ships arrive at multiple ports, delays are more likely to occur. In some ports, cargo cannot be unloaded until a ship is cleared. the same time, ships have waited up to 4 hours before being cleared. CBP officials told us that these types of inspection delays are generally caused by staff shortages, outdated or crowded facilities, clustered arrivals, or some combination of these factors. Although the need to address some of the user fee challenges presented in this report may appear obvious, how to accomplish this is less clear. Where appropriate, changes made to one fee should be designed to complement rather than conflict with the other fees. The separate, disparate fees supporting the largely consolidated inspection process appear to aggravate disconnects between the customs passenger and vessel fees and the corresponding inspection activities. Unless remedied, differences such as the way overtime charges are assessed for commercial vessel inspections will persist, causing confusion and raising equity concerns. Unless CBP automates its collection methods, requires monthly remittance, and aligns fee rate increases with the annual fee caps, CBP will continue to incur unnecessary administrative costs and needlessly expose the public to unnecessary risk. Until CBP fully implements a system to assess and collect interest and penalties on late HMF payments, the federal government will continue to incur revenue losses. The lack of complete, transparent cost and collections data for the MPF and AQI fees can prevent agencies from addressing existing issues, the authors say. Harmonizing the fees could include eliminating the differences in the way charges for overtime inspections are assessed to commercial vessel operators, they say. The authors recommend that the Secretary of Homeland Security take the following four actions: Develop a legislative proposal to harmonize the customs, immigration, and agricultural quarantine inspections fees. Officer and Office of General Counsel on this issue. USDA noted that it has been APHIS’s position that because USDA receives appropriations to pay for departmental and staff office costs, OPM receives appropriations for imputed costs such as future retirement benefit expenses. We interpret the AQI user fee statute as permitting USDA to recover all costs associated with its program, including imputed and indirect costs. We recognize that retirement and unfunded pension liabilities may be more directly linked to the fee- funded activity and more easily calculated than seeking to allocate departmental and staff office costs. “full cost recovery” should be viewed from a governmentwide perspective. Even though USDA would have to deposit those portions of user fee collections as miscellaneous receipts in the general fund of the Treasury, it would still defray a cost that Congress determined should be paid for by the user fees. If USDA believes that the statutory authority does not permit it to cover such indirect and imputed costs, then we believe it should not. believe USDA should seek additional authority from Congress consistent with our recommendation. USDA also noted that it will need to (1) work with DHS to identify DHS’s imputed costs for the AQI program and (2) consider the impact of the fee increase on payers. DOD provided oral comments, and concurred with the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the report related to the Army Corps’ Harbor Maintenance Fee.

In selecting the fees, we reviewed relevant policy and economic literature, interviewed user fee experts, and examined Office of Management and Budget data on user charges. We chose these fees because they are levied upon port users, and are related to maritime, safety, and homeland security programs. Additionally, we chose them because they vary in their key design characteristics, specifically in the way in which they are set, collected, used, and reviewed. implementation characteristics. We interviewed officials responsible for managing the selected user fees. To select the ports that we visited, we consulted with port security experts from within and outside of the U.S. We also spoke with officials from the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) We also interviewed officials from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) offices in Washington, D.C. to get a sense of how the fees are managed. outside of GAO, with CBP and Corps officials, and with outside stakeholders, in order to choose ports. We also considered travel costs in selecting the site visits. In light of the significant amount of ongoing audit work in the Gulf region, and because other ports in our selection are representative, we also considered other sites in the region as well. We chose ports that varied in their type and volume of trade and commerce (including cruise lines, container ships, petroleum products, and liquefied natural gas) The ports we selected include medium and large ports, natural deepwater ports, and those that require frequent dredging. We visited the ports of Boston, Massachusetts; Charleston, South Carolina; Newark, New Jersey/New York, New York; Baltimore, Maryland; Miami, Florida; Port Everglades, Florida. At these ports, we observed passenger, vessel, and cargo inspections, and interviewed officials from CBP and Corps field offices. At each port, we spoke with each port official. various stakeholders, including port authority officials, customs brokers, shipping agents, harbor pilots, importers, and cruise line officials. We coordinated our work with another GAO team that was examining the customs, AQI, and immigration air passenger inspection fees, and drew upon their audit findings as appropriate. In addition, we reviewed collections and cost data for each of the fees, data on balances in the system, and data on collections and costs for each fee. We also met with the following national stakeholder organizations: the American Association of Port Authorities, the Cruise Lines International Association, the Association of Ship Brokers and Agents, and the World Shipping Council. the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, and data on channel availability provided by the Corps. We asked questions about APHIS, CBP, and Corps internal controls for the data we used. We performed our work from February 2007 through February 2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. The HMF is not assessed on domestic cargo valued at less than $1,000, and quarterly payment is not required if the total value of all shipments for which a fee was assessed is less than that amount. for the quarter does not exceed $10,000. No payment is required for imported cargo that is entitled to be entered under informal entry procedures.

Summary:
USDA, FDA, EPA, and NMFS are involved in key program functions related to food safety. In fiscal year 2003, the four federal agencies spent nearly $1.7 billion on food safety-related activities. As a result of this division of responsibility, the federal food safety system is fragmented. While the federal agencies regulate the food production chain from farms to food manufacturers, state and local agencies primarily regulate food safety in retail food establishments. The Department of Homeland Security provides overall coordination on how to protect the food supply.

Summary:
As technology has advanced, the federal government has become increasingly dependent on computerized information systems. Federal agencies rely on such systems to process, maintain, and report large volumes of sensitive data, such as personal information. Ineffective protection of these systems and information can impair delivery of vital services and result in loss or theft of computer resources, assets, and funds. It can also undermine of agency missions due to embarrassing incidents that erode the public’s confidence in government, the report says. damage to networks and equipment; and high costs for remediation. Federal law includes requirements intended to improve the protection of government information and systems. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014 requires the head of each agency to provide information security protections commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of the agency’s information or information systems. More specifically, federal agencies are to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program to provide security. for the information and information systems that support the operations of the agency. The head of each agency is responsible for, among other things, ensuring that senior agency officials carry out their information security responsibilities. The act also assigned OMB and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) oversight responsibilities to assist agencies in effectively implementing information security protections. In addition, NIST isresponsible for developing the information security standards for the federal government. The agency is also responsible for developing information security policies and procedures. standards and guidelines that include minimum information security requirements. During fiscal year 2015, IRS collected more than $3.3 trillion; processed more than 243 million tax returns and other forms. IRS relies extensively on computerized information systems, which it must effectively secure to protect sensitive financial and taxpayer data for the collection of taxes, processing of tax returns, and enforcement of federal tax laws. In carrying out its mission, IRS relies heavily on computerize information systems. IRS’s mission is to provide Americans with top-quality service by helping them to understand and meet their tax responsibilities. The IRS collects and maintains a significant amount of personal and financial information on each U.S. taxpayer. Protecting this sensitive information is essential to protecting taxpayers’ privacy and preventing financial loss and damages that could result from identity theft and other financial crimes. The IRS employs about 90,000 people in its Washington, D.C., headquarters and at more than 550 offices in all 50 states, U.s. territories, and some U.N. embassies and consulates. More than $403 billion in tax refunds. unique operational challenges. Risks to cyber-based assets can originate from unintentional or intentional threats. Unintentional threats can be caused by natural disasters, defective computer or network equipment, software coding errors, and the actions of careless or poorly trained employees. Intentional threats include targeted and untargeted attacks from criminal groups, hackers, disgruntled employees, and disgruntled customers. The senior agency official responsible for information security is the Associate CIO, who heads the IRS Information Technology Cybersecurity organization. employees, foreign nations engaged in espionage and information warfare, and terrorists. These adversaries vary in terms of their capabilities, willingness to act, and motives. These threat sources make use of various techniques, or exploits, that may adversely affect federal information, computers, software, networks, and operations. These exploits are carried out through various conduits, including websites, e-mails, wireless and cellular communications, Internet protocols, portable media, and social media. Further, adversaries can leverage common computer software programs as a means by which to deliver a threat. The number of information security incidents affecting systems supporting the federal government is increasing. The number of incidents reported by federal agencies to the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) increased from 5,503 in fiscal year 2006 to 67,168 in fiscalyear 2014, an increase of 1,121 percent. According to OMB, agencies reported 77,183 incidents in fiscal Year 2015. Similarly, theNumber of incidents involving PII reported byFederal agencies has more than doubled in recent years, from 10,481 in 2009 to 27,624 in 2014. federal agencies spent about $13.1 billion on cybersecurity in fiscal year 2016. The president’s fiscal year 2017 budget proposes investing over $19 billion in resources for cybersecurity. Cyber incidents can adversely affect national security, damage public health and safety, and compromise sensitive information. In June 2015, the Commissioner of the IRS testified that unauthorized third parties had gained access to taxpayer information from its Get Transcript application. According to officials, criminals are targeting the IRS’ Get Transcript app to steal information. used taxpayer- specific data acquired from non-agency sources to gain unauthorized access to information on approximately 100,000 tax accounts. These data included Social Security information, dates of birth, and street addresses. In an August 2015 update, IRS reported this number to be about 114,000. In a February 2016 update, the agency reported that an additional 390,000 accounts had been accessed. The online Get Transcript service has been unavailable since May 2015. In March 2016, IRS stated that as part of its ongoing IRS temporarily suspended the Identity Protection Personal Identification Number (IP PIN) service on IRS.gov. IP PIN is a single-use identification number provided to taxpayers who are victims of identity theft (IDT) to help prevent future IDT refund fraud. Service on IRS’s website allowed taxpayers to retrieve their IP PINs online. As of April 7, the IP PIN service was temporarily suspended by the IRS. The IRS stated that it was conducting further review of theIP PIN service and is looking at further strengthening the security features. IRS has implemented numerous protections over key financial and tax processing systems. IRS had not always effectively implemented access and other controls, including elements of its information security program. In our most recent review we determined that IRS had improved access controls, but some weaknesses remain. The agency had yet to address weaknesses in its review of access lists for both employees and visitors to sensitive areas, the report found. The online service was still suspended. The report was published by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. IRS had not updated key mainframe policies and procedures to address issues such as comprehensively auditing and monitoring access. The agency had not fully mitigated previously identified deficiencies or ensured that its corrective actions were effective. IRS told us it had completed corrective actions for 28 of our prior recommendations; however, we determined that 9 of these had not been effectively implemented. The IRS Commissioner stated that while the agency agreed with our new recommendations, it will review them to ensure that its actions include sustainable fixes. major elements of an effective data breach response program. IRS did not require considering the number of affected individuals as a factor when determining if affected individuals should be notified of a suspected breach. IDT refund fraud occurs when a refund-seeking fraudster obtains an individual’s Social Security number, date of birth, or other PII and uses it to file a fraudulent tax return seeking a refund. IRS estimated that it prevented or recovered $22.5 billion in fraudulent IDT refunds in filing season 2014. for its Identity Assurance Office to assess costs, benefits, and risk of authentication tools. In February 2016, officials told us that this office plans to complete a strategic plan for taxpayer authentication across the agency in September 2016. Until it completes these steps, IRS will lack key information to make decisions about whether and how much to invest in authentication options. Under FISMA, the Director of OMB is responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of policies, principles, standards, and guidelines on information security. NIST is responsible under FISMA for developing security standards and guidelines for agencies. OMB and NIST have prescribed policies, standards, and guidelines that are intended to assist federal agencies with identifying and providing information security protections. These include standards for categorizing information and information systems according to ranges of impact levels, minimum security requirements for information and Information systems in risk categories, guidelines for detection and handling of information security incidents. NIST, Federal Information Processing Standard 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems. or high-impact for the security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. NIST Federal Information Processing Standard 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems, provides a risk-based process for selecting the security controls necessary to satisfy these requirements. OMB and NIST also have provided guidance to agencies on procedures for authenticating users to federal information systems and organizations. The NIST Special Publication 800-53 provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for federal Information systems and Organizations. federal systems and websites, including the following. OMB M-15-13, Policy to Require Secure Connections across Federal Websites and Web Services, which requires all publicly accessible federal websites and web services to provide service through a secure connection. O MB M-04-04, E-Authentication Guidance for Federal Agencies, which addresses federal government services accomplished using the Internet, instead of on paper, and calls for identity verification or authentication to make sure that online government services are secure and protect privacy. NIST Special Publication 800-63-2, Electronic Authentication Guideline, provides technical guidelines for federal agencies implementing electronic authentication. It covers remote authentication of users (such as employees, contractors, or private individuals) interacting with government IT systems over open networks. It provides technical requirements for agencies to use in selecting technology to authenticate users. It also provides technical recommendations for agencies on how to use the technology to protect users' privacy and security. It is published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Successful authentication occurs when an individual proves through the means of authentication that he or she possesses and controls the token. The cryptographic methods used at this level may still allow someone with malicious intent to intercept the transmission of a password through eavesdropping and crack it using a dictionary attack. Level 2: Requires single-factor remote authentication, using one of three factors—something you know (e.g., a password), or a combination of the two or three factors used in the previous level. Level 1: Identity proofing is not required. something you have (e.g., an identification badge), or something you are. Identity proofing requirements are introduced, requiring presentation of identifying materials or information. Approved cryptographic methods would not allow the type of eavesdropping attack that is possible at Level 1. Level 3: Requires multi-factor remote authentication, requiring at least two authentication factors. An individual proves possession of a physical or software token in combination with some memorized knowledge. Level 4: Is intended to provide the highest practical remote network authentication assurance. the proof of possession of a key through a cryptographic protocol. At this level in-person identity proofing is required. It is otherwise similar to Level 3, except with stronger cryptographic methods in place. Federal law also gives OMB and DHS responsibility and authority for oversight of operational aspects of federal information security. In particular, the OMB Director is charged with overseeing and enforcing agency compliance with information security requirements by taking certain actions authorized by relevant federal law. OMB has developed various mechanisms to carry out its oversight function. OMB the power of enforcement and accountability related to evaluating agencies’ management of their information resources. In particular, in enforcing accountability, OMB is empowered to recommend reductions or increases in an agency’s budget. OMB Cyber and National Security Unit (OMB Cyber) within the Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer. This unit is responsible for strengthening federal cybersecurity through oversight of agency and government-wide programs, among other things. The unit was established in fiscal year 2015, and is based in Washington, D.C. and implementing policies to address emerging IT security risks, and oversight of government-wide response to major incidents and vulnerabilities. CyberStat Reviews: OMB has also established the “CyberStat Review’ process, which involves evidence-based meetings led by OMB to ensure agencies are accountable for their cybersecurity posture. FISMA reporting: As required by FISma, OMB reports annually to Congress on the effectiveness of information security policies and practices at executive branch agencies during the preceding year. Modernization Act of 2014 codified its responsibility for certain operational aspects of federal agency cybersecurity. In particular, DHS is responsible for administering, in consultation with OMB, the implementation of agency information security policies and practices for information systems. It also operates the federal information security incident center (the U.S Computer Emergency Readiness Team or US-CERT), deploying technology to continuously protect the nation's information systems and networks. The agency is also responsible for developing, issuing, and overseeing the Implementation of binding operational directives to agencies. diagnose and mitigate threats, compiling and analyzing data, and developing and conducting targeted operational evaluations of systems. In May 2015 DHS issued its first directive, which required all departments and agencies to review and mitigate all critical vulnerabilities on their Internet-facing systems. DHS identifies these vulnerabilities using scanning tools and reports the results to agencies on a weekly basis. Agencies are then required to mitigate the DHS-identified vulnerabilities within 30 days of the report, or provide a justification to DHS outlining barriers, planned steps for resolution. supplied agencies with tools and technologies to assist in protecting against cyber threats and vulnerabilities. Since fiscal year 2013, DHS has provided agencies the opportunity to use a suite of tools and capabilities to identify cybersecurity risks. National Cybersecurity Protection System: NCPS is an integrated system-of-systems intended to deliver a range of capabilities for intrusion detection, intrusion prevention, analytics, and information sharing. When deployed on an agency’s connection to the Internet, NCPS can be used to identify and mitigate cyber threats. the system monitors inbound and outbound traffic for malicious activity. IRS needs to continue to address weaknesses in access controls and configuration management. Fully implementing key elements of a breach response program will help ensure that when breaches of sensitive data do occur, their impact on affected individuals will be limited. The risks IRS is exposed to have been illustrated by recent incidents involving public-facing applications, highlighting the importance of securing systems that contain sensitive taxpayer and financial data. In summary, while IRS has made progress in implementing information security controls, it must continue to do so. will be minimized. IRS also needs to assess the costs, benefits, and risks of alternatives for better authenticating taxpayers who access its systems. strengthening the security posture of IRS—and other agencies— also depends on the key roles played by OMB, NIST, and DHS in providing oversight and guidance.

Summary:
Most discussions of Russian interests in Iraq focus on economic factors. Moscow has cultivated friendly relations with Baghdad since the 1960s. U.S.R. was Saddam's main arms supplier during Iraq's 1980-1988 war with Iran. Russia stillperceives itself ashaving strategic interests and an historic role in that region and does not want to be seen as betraying a long-timefriend. Back to Mail Online home. Backto the page you came from. Back To The page you come from. Baghdad owed Moscow $7-$8billion for Soviet-era arms sales during the Iran-Iraq War. Adjusted for inflation, this debt may total $10-12 billiontoday. Russian oil companies havecontracts that could beworth as much as $30 billion over 20 years to develop Iraqi oil fields. In August 2002, Iraq announced that Russian firms would receivecontracts worth $20 billion over 10 years. Russian firms have contractsworth billions to helpmodernize Iraq's economic infrastructure. $40billion over 5 years to modernize Iraq's oil, electrical, chemical, agricultural, and transport sectors. Russia profits greatly from high oil prices, the biggest single factor behindRussian economicgrowth today. Russian leaders fear that a post-Saddam Iraq (with the second largest proven oil reserves in theworld) mightmaximize its oil output, dramatically driving up the price of oil. In 2000,Russia's oil exports earned $25.3 billion. The total Russian Federal budget in 2000 was $48 billion. down the price of oil. A sharper price drop, below $18/bbl, would severely impactRussiangovernment revenues. With a Duma (lower legislative chamber) election in December 2003 and Putin expected to seek reelection in March2004, such adevelopment is dreaded in the Kremlin. Many observers believe that Russian policy is also motivated by a desire to restrain U.S. global domination and rein in perceived U.N.tendencies toward unilateralism. Some analysts estimated that a $6/b Bl fall couldcut Russia's projected economic growth in 2003 in half. and excessive reliance on military force. The idea of a multi-polar world not totallydominated by asingle "hyper-power" still has strong appeal in Russia. Putin does not seek to project Russia into theforefront of ananti-American coalition. He seeks, in cooperation with the U.S., to defeat al Qaeda in the Middle East and other terrorist groups in the region, writes Peter Bergen. He says Russia may have an interest inprinciple in opposing "unilateral" U.N. military action in Iraq. traditional U.S. allies France and Germany as well as withRussian partnerssuch as China. Putin reoriented Russian foreign and defense policy toward broad cooperation with the United States. Putinsees Russia's economic reconstruction and revitalization proceeding from its integration in the global economic system dominated by the advancedindustrial democracies. This cannot be accomplished in an atmosphere of political/military confrontationor antagonismwith the United State, he says. He says Putin therefore shifted Russian policy in 2001 to put some limits on U.s. power. national security policy toward integration with the West and cooperation withthe United States. Most observers believe thisremains the basis of Putin's national security policy. By February 2003, Russian experts concluded that war in Iraq was virtually inevitable and Russia began evacuating its citizens. Although Russia opposed U.S. military action, it hoped to prevent this disagreement from damaging broaderbilateral relations. OnMarch 12, Deputy Foreign Minister Georgi Mamedov said that if war erupts, Russia "will cooperate with the UnitedStates for anearly resolution" of the conflict. the Bush Administration began to make clear in 2002 its determination to overthrow the regime of Iraqi President SaddamHussein. By mid-2002, some Russian officials and scholars hinted that Moscowmight not objecttoo strongly to U.S. military action against Iraq, provided that Washington did not act unilaterally and that Russianeconomic interests in Iraq were respected. These discussions werereported in the Russian and American press and undoubtedly were detected in Baghdad. Iraq's announcement (August 16, 2002) of the $40 billion agreement for Russian firms to modernize Iraq'sinfrastructure may have been an attempt to ensure Russian political support. December 2002, Iraqi authorities cancelled a $3.7billion contract with Lukoil to develop the huge West Qurna oil field. Many analysts viewed this asretaliation against Lukoil, whose CEO, Vagit Alekperov, reportedly held discussions with U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham. Moscow can also be seen trying to balance its interest in preserving a major role for itself in a multi-polar world in cooperation withFrance, Germany, and China, on one hand, against its desire to avoid conflict with the United States. was demonstrated in the negotiations leading up the U.N. Security Council's (UNSC)approval of Resolution1441 (November 8, 2002), in which France took the lead in pressing the United States for concessions. Many observers believed that the conclusion of Putin's balancing act would be a deal with Washington whereby Russia would agreenot to use its UNSC veto in return for U.S. guarantees of Russian economic interests in Iraq. A Russian parliamentary leader close to Putin suggested such a deal in October 2002. "If the Americans and British can reassure Moscow that a future Iraqi regime will not beprejudicial toRussian economic interests, they will be better placed to secure its acquiescence" Putin sent his chief of staff, Aleksandr Voloshin,to Washington (February 24-25, 2003), where he met with the President, Secretary of State, and National SecurityAdvisor. TheRussian press reported his trip as, "an attempt to seal concrete economic deals in return for Russia's support orabstention on theSecurity Council" U.S. officials reportedly suggested an informal "gentleman's agreement" to respect Russian economic interests in post-Saddam Iraq. Russia's economic interests will receive due consideration, says U.S., but Iraq owes money to manycountries. Russia ought not be put in a special category in preference to all others, says the United States. The United States does not control the price of oil and cannotguarantee specificprice levels, adds the U.N. secretary-general. Russiawanted concrete, unequivocal guarantees. On February 28, 2003, the U.S. State Department designated three Chechen groups with alleged links to Al Qaeda as terroristorganizations. On March 6, the Senate unanimously approved the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty. OnMarch 10, SenLugar introduced a bill ( S. 580 ) to exempt Russia from the provisions of the Jackson-Vanik amendment. None of thesemoves are directly related to Iraq, except for the treaty. U.S. Ambassador to Russia Alexander Vershbow reportedly toldRussian reporters on March 12 that a Russian veto of the U.S.-backed Security Council resolution on Iraq woulddamage bilateralrelations. Vershbows mentioned cooperation on security, energy, antiterrorism, antimissile defenses, and the spaceprogram as areas that could be adversely affected by a Russian vetoed resolution. In February 2003, Russian opposition to U.N. military action against Iraq hardened. Putin traveled to Berlin and Parisand joined French President Chirac and German Chancellor Schroeder in a joint declaration stating that Russia would not support U.K. military intervention in Iraq. that there wasstill an alternativeto war and that Russia, France, and Germany were determined to work together to complete disarmament in Iraqpeacefully. (14) On March 2, Putin rejected regime change as a legitimate goal in Iraq. "[T]he international community cannot interfere with thedomestic affairs of any country in order to change its regime," he said. On March10, Foreign Minister Ivanov declared that if the U.S.-backed resolutionauthorizing war was submitted to the UNSC, Russia would vote against it. in Iraq, Putin called the attack "a big mistake," "unjustified," and insistedthat military action be ended quickly. Russian media, like that in many other European countries, took a generallynegative attitudetoward coalition military action. InRussia, however,the Kremlin exercises very strong influence over the media, especially TV. Russian public opinion overwhelminglyopposed whatmost Russians saw as U.S. aggression. There were large anti-war rallies in major cities and spontaneousmanifestations ofanti-Americanism. Russia's shift suggests two questions: why the more hard-line stance toward U.S. policy on Iraq; and has Putin irrevocably "jumpedinto the French and German camp"? There are probably multiple factors behind Putin's more hard line stance toward the United States. There is Russia's interest inpromoting a "multi-polar world" and bolstering the stature and authority of the U.N. Russia has been "straddling both sides" of the war in Iraq. vis-a-vis the United States. Most of Russia'spolitical elites as well as the majority of the national security establishment were hostile to the prospect of a U.S.war in Iraq. Over90% of Russians also strongly opposed the war. Putin may feel that he cannot appear completely to ignore the opinions of hisgenerals and diplomats, the political establishment, and the voters. By early April, the demonstration - yet again - of America's unrivaled military capability must have been very disturbing to manyRussians. casualty figures, which must be much higher than announced. Thewide and widening gap betweenU.S. and Russian military capabilities both embarrasses and frightens many Russians. The Bush Administration has not given Moscow the firm assurances it wantsguaranteeing Russian economic interests in Iraq. Now that the battlefield aspect of the Iraq conflict is essentially over, it remains to be seen how strong Russian opposition will be to U.S.-led policy. That may depend on how Putin weighs the benefits of "principled" and domestically popularopposition to the United States against the costs. the enmity of the Bush Administration on an issue that Bush clearlyconsiders to be ofsupreme importance. The two presidents spoke by telephone on March 18 and reportedly agreed that despitedifferences on Iraq,bilateral cooperation on other issues would be increased. On March 20, Putin criticized the U.S. attack as a"political blunder" thatcould jeopardize the international security system. Other Russian officials emphasized theimportance ofminimizing the damage in bilateral relations. Iraq conflict. Several legislative leaders close to Putin, however, criticized this action as against Russianinterests andpredicted Russian approval of the treaty soon. (18) Some lawmakers close to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, have called for the treaty to be scrapped. (19) Russian lawmakers have also called for an end to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. (20) Russian legislators have also criticized the treaty, saying it is against Russian interests. (21) The treaty is expected to be approved by Russia soon.

Summary:
The focus of patent examination is to determine whether the invention in a patent application satisfies the legal requirements for a patent, including that the invention be novel and not obvious. USPTO’s manual for patent examiners establishes certain requirements and processes that examiners must follow in examining patent applications, including performing prior art searches. There are generally two types of prior art—patent literature or patent expert exhaustive readiness. The examining process involves a variety of steps, at least one of which includes prior art searches. Patent literature consists of previously issued U.S. or foreign patents and published patent applications. Nonpatent literature can include such things as product manuals, standards established by international organizations, textbooks, periodicals, or conference presentations. Both patent and nonpatent Literature may be written in a language other than English, referred to as foreign-language art in this report. USPTO’s manual for patent examiners requires them to conduct a thorough prior art search and directs them to consider all prior art unless they can justify with reasonable certainty that no more patents are needed. Examiners are expected to complete their examination of an application in a certain number of hours. The time allotted varies depending on factors such as the technology and the seniority of the examiner. For example, an examiner reviewing an application related to wire fabrics and structure may be allotted about 14 hours for examination. For an examiner at the same experience level, such as a database and file management examiner, the allotted time would be about 32 hours for that application. The allotted time includes the time needed to review the application, perform the examination, and other tasks. a search for prior art, and complete all office actions. Examiners have minimum production goals, based on the time allotted, for the number of office actions they must complete. USPTO uses several different information technology systems to assist examiners in conducting prior art searches. For example, to search U.S. patent literature, examiners use two systems, the Examiner’s Automated Search Tool (EAST) and the Web-Based Examiner search Tool (WEST) USPTO’s Scientific and Technical Information Center (STIC) operates systems that can search U.S. patent literature and that store some nonpatent literature. Examiners may access additional foreign patent documents through other web-based tools. According to a USPTO document, the agency had subscriptions to 119 different journals or external databases in 2014.from 1920 through 1970. These systems also include abstracts of some foreign patents. The agency has no immediate access to computer-generated translations, known as machine translations. As of May 2015, USPTO had nearly 8,300 patent examiners across the eight technology centers we reviewed. Examiners at the GS-14 level or above are generally primary examiners. Primary examiners may accept or reject a patent application without additional review.machine translation services from STIC and three contracted translation vendors that currently cover 35 languages. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office uses the General Schedule (GS) classification system for examiners, whose levels range from GS-5 to GS-15. junior examiners—most examiners below the GS-14 level—whose work must first be reviewed by a primary examiner before an office action can be sent to the applicant. Supervisory patent examiners are responsible for the day-to-day management of examiners. In addition to applying for a patent from USPTO, an inventor may also seek patent protection in other countries for the same invention by filing in multiple patent offices. Such interrelated patent applications are described as a patent family. World Intellectual Property Organization says 2.7 million patent applications were filed worldwide in 2014. 2.2 million applications filed with patent offices in the United States, China, Japan, South Korea, and Europe. EPO issues patents that cover 42 countries, most of which are member countries that are party to the European Patent Agreement (EPO) The organization estimates that approximately half of all applications worldwide are repetitive filings in a patent family, and the rest are initial filings. The IP5 offices, including EPO and JPO, each receive hundreds of thousands of applications each year. EPO and JPO have about one-half and one-fifth as many examiners as USPTO, respectively. There is a limit on the number of federal employees JPO can have; therefore, 494 of its 1,702 examiners are fixed-term. English (about 80 percent of applications), French (about 5 percent), and German (about 15 percent) are the official languages of the EPO, JPO and other patent offices. The EPO has three official languages, one of which is used for processing an application. rather than permanent employees, and JPO has begun outsourcing aspects of prior art search. USPTO examiners face a variety of challenges in identifying relevant prior art during patent examination. Experts we interviewed and examiners we surveyed cited challenges related to certain attributes of  prior art and patent applications andUSPTO examination. JPO officials stated that outsourcing some aspects ofPrior Art searches based on instructions from a government examiner frees up the examiners’ time and allows the office to review more applications. Examiners report difficulties with the amount and relevance of prior art references provided by applicants. Examiners find that excessive references make it somewhat or much more difficult to complete a thorough prior art search in the time allotted. Expert: Nonpatent literature and foreign-language prior art are difficult to find. Prior art from the mid-1970s is particularly challenging to find because it has not been digitized and is not fully digitized by the USPTO, the authors say. They say examiners do not have ready access to textbooks that are good source of good prior art. Clarity of applications can pose a challenge to finding relevant prior art. Inconsistent terminology can make it more difficult for examiners to findrelevant prior art because searching for one term using keyword searches will not identify documents that use a different term. USPTO’s practice that examiners should attempt to identify all applicable grounds for rejecting a claim or claims during their first review may discourage examiners from resolving any issues of clarity or ambiguity before conducting their initial searches. Time pressures may reduce examiners’ ability to conduct thorough prior art searches. EPO and JPO use several approaches that may help their examiners address challenges. These approaches include worksharing, creating internal databases of nonpatent literature, using patent classification systems, and adopting advanced search tools. Examiners may then look at other applications and find similar inventions within the same group to find more relevant results. The IP5, a multilateral forum of the five largest patent offices, identified worksh sharing as the main tool for addressing an increasing number of patent applications. is more difficult to find relevant prior art. As of March 2016, USPTO had not established a documented strategy to identify and assess new sources. The agency does not currently have specific plans to add additional nonpatent literature sources to its new system because of its initial focus on developing parity with the existing system, the authors say. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office uses two methods to review examinations, which may help the agency monitor the effects of the challenges described above and the thoroughness of searches.

Summary:
Prepositioned equipment and supplies are strategic assets for projecting military power. Military equipment and infrastructure are often located in corrosive environments. Estimates of corrosion costs DOD-wide have ranged from $10 billion to $20 billion annually. The Army and Marine Corps have taken some measures to reduce the impact of corrosion on prepositioned assets, but the Army could increase its use of storage facilities for land-based assets, authors say. They say temporary shelters may be a feasible option to address immediate storage needs.

Summary:
Congress has enacted several laws to assist agencies and the federal government in managing IT investments. About 8.5 percent of federal agencies’ planned spending for fiscal year 2016 has gone toward provisioned IT services. The vast majority of spending going toward IT that is non-provisioned. The federal government has spent billions of dollars on failed and poorly performing IT investments which often suffered from ineffective management, such as project planning, requirements definition, and program oversight and governance, the authors say. They recommend implementing the recently-enacted statutory requirements promoting IT acquisition reform. recommendations had been implemented. OMB has implemented a series of initiatives to improve the oversight of underperforming investments and more effectively manage IT. In June 2009, to further improve the transparency into and oversight of agencies’ IT investments, OMB publicly deployed the IT Dashboard. Currently, the Dashboard publicly displays information on the cost, schedule, and performance of over 700 major federal IT investments at 26 federal agencies. Further, the public display of OMB’s recommendations will be expanded. The data is intended to allow OMB, other oversight bodies, and the general public to hold the government agencies accountable for results and progress. Among other things, agencies are to submit ratings from their Chief Information Officers (CIO), which, according to OMB’s instructions, should reflect the level of risk facing an investment. Each agency CIO is to assess his or her IT investments against a set of six pre-established evaluation factors and then assign a rating of 1 (high risk and red) to 5. Over the past several years, we have made over 20 recommendations to help improve the accuracy and reliability of the information on the IT Dashboard. Most agencies agreed with our recommendations or had no comment. In January 2010, the Federal CIO began leading TechStat sessions to terminate or turn around IT investments that are failing or are not producing results. These meetings involve OMB and agency leadership and are intended to increase accountability and accountability for agency IT investments. The CIO’s best judgement of the level of risk facing the investment.(low risk and green) based on the CIO's best judgement. OMB’s 25-Point IT Reform Plan included a “Cloud First’ policy that required each agency CIO to implement cloud-based solutions whenever a secure, reliable, and cost-effective cloud option exists. In May 2012, OMB released its Federal IT Shared Services Strategy. The strategy requires agencies to save at least $3.8 billion through this initiative. OMB partially agreed with our recommendations, and responses from 21 of the agencies varied, with some agreeing and others not. to use shared services to increase return on investment, eliminate waste and duplication, and improve the effectiveness of IT solutions. Examples of commodity IT areas to consider migrating to a shared environment, as described in the strategy, include software licenses, e-mail systems, and human resource systems. Of the more than $80 billion reportedly spent on federal IT in fiscal year 2015, 26 federal agencies spent about $61 billion on O&M, more than three-quarters of the total amount spent. According to agency data reported to OMB’s IT Dashboard, the 10 IT investments spending the most on O &M for fiscal year2015 total $12.5 billion. systems has decreased by about $7.3 billion since fiscal year 2010. O&M spending relative to overall IT spending has increased by 9 percent since 2010. In fiscal year 2017, agencies plan to spend 77 percent of their IT funds on O &M. According to agency officials, reasons for the increase in O & M spending include the recent shift of major systems from DME to O& M. The percentage of total IT spending on O&m ranges from a 20 percent increase (Department of Education) to a 16 percent decrease (Office of Personnel Management) the CIO stated that one reason for the increased spending on O&M as a percentage of its total is because initially DHS had high DME spending to setup the agency. DHS officials stated that they anticipate future increases in DME funding as prioritized IT modernization efforts are approved and funded. Further, an official in Department of State’s (State) Bureau of Information Resource Management stated that the increase is largely due to increased costs of maintaining the infrastructure, including meeting security requirements. Moreover, VA officials stated that updates to its technology are the primary reason for the increase in spending. In addition, an official in HHS’s Office of the CIO stated that the increased spending on O&M was largely due to grants to states and local entities for new programs, such as the Affordable Care Act. Conversely, several agencies have decreased spending onO&M. For example, as we have previously reported, the Department of Energy reduced spending by approximately $300 million, which it attributed to the reclassification of high performance computers. were re-categorized because they include both supercomputers and laboratory facilities. Department of Commerce reduced spending by approximately $110 million and attributed it to the reclassification of satellite ground systems from its IT portfolio. We disagreed with these reclassifications, and reported that they run contrary to the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, which specifies requirements for the management of IT. Further, we reported that by gathering information on satellites, the CIO and others in the oversight of satellites. incomplete information on IT investments, OMB increases the risk of not fulfilling its oversight responsibilities. We recommended that Energy and Commerce appropriately categorize their IT investments. Both agencies disagreed. A policy analyst within OMB’s Office of E-Government and Information Technology expressed concern when agencies, or their bureaus, spend a low percentage of their IT funds on DME. The analyst further stated that this could indicate that the agency's maintenance costs are reducing its flexibility and ability to innovate. 5 of the 26 agencies that report to the IT Dashboard reported spending less than 10 percent on DME activities in fiscal year 2015. 34 percent of bureaus (i.e., 51 of the 151) spent less than ten percent on the DME. According to agency officials, reasons for low DME spending include the size and mission of the bureau. The agency or bureau is unable to innovate, according to the agency officials. For more details, see appendix III of this report. as well as several bureaus having recently completed major DME work that is now in the O&M phase. Commerce officials: One of their bureau had no actual IT systems in its budget, as its IT has been absorbed by headquarters. OMB staff in the Office of E-Government and Information Technology have recognized the upward trend of O&m spending and identified several contributing factors, including maintaining legacy hardware, which costs more over time, and (2) costs are rising. increased in maintaining applications and systems that use older programming languages. programmers knowledgeable in these older languages are becoming increasingly rare and thus more expensive. OMB encourages agencies to adopt provisioned IT services, such as cloud computing and shared services, to make IT more efficient and cost-effective. According to OMB, agencies tend to categorize investments as O&M because they attract less oversight, require reduced documentation, and have a lower risk of losing funding. In several situations where agencies are not sure whether to report costs as O and DME, agencies default to reporting as O &M. agile, and enable innovation. It provides an approach for agencies to implement cloud-based solutions whenever a secure, reliable, and cost-effective cloud option exists. OMB identified a series of performance metrics for agencies’ PortfolioStat sessions to measure the federal government’s progress in driving value in federal IT investments. One measure is the percent of IT spending on non-provisioned O&M spending. The goal is to increase return on investment, eliminate waste and duplication, and improve the effectiveness of IT solutions. Federal agencies reported spending $55 billion—69 percent of total IT spending—on non-provisioned O&M in fiscal year 2015. OMB has not identified an associated goal with its non- provisioned IT measure. For example, State allocates about 87 percent of its IT spending on non- Proportions. Department of Transportation (DOT) allocates 50 percent. See figure 5 for details on agencies’ planned spending allocations. For more information on OMB’s Non-Provisioned IT Measure, visit the OMB website. The aim is for the amount of spending on DME and provisioned IT services to rise. OMB has not identified a specific goal for the measure because it would be ever changing. While goals for performance measures may change over time, it is still important for OMB to set a target by which agencies can measure their progress in meeting this measure. In particular, leading practices should be monitored to ensure that agencies are following the best practices. That is part of the PortfolioStat process. stress that organizations should measure performance in order to evaluate the success or failure of their activities and programs. Performance measurement involves identifying performance goals and measures, identifying targets for improving performance, and measuring progress against those targets. Without links to outcomes and goals, organizations are not able to effectively measure progress toward those goals. OMB’s own website, performance.gov states that when measuring performance, a goal is a simple but powerful way to motivate people and communicate priorities. In addition, the website states that the federal government operates more effectively when agency leaders, at all levels of the organization, focus on performance. The O&M phase is often the longest phase of an investment and can consume more than 80 percent of the total lifecycle costs. As such, agencies must actively manage their investment during this phase. Until OMB develops a specific goal associated with measuring non- provisioned services, OMB and agencies will be limited in their ability to evaluate progress that has been made and whether or not they are achieving their goals to increase the amount spent on development activities and provisioned IT services.starting at the top, set clear measurable goals aligned to achieving better outcomes. CIOs from 12 selected agencies reported that 23 of their 187 major IT O&M investments were moderate to high risk as of August 2015. They requested $922.9 million in fiscal year 2016 for these investments. Of the 23 investments, agencies had plans to replace or modernize 19 investments. However, the plans for 12 of those were general or tentative in that the agencies did not have specific plans to make changes to the investments, the CIOs said in a report. not provide specificity on time frames, activities to be performed, or functions to be replaced or enhanced. Agencies did not plan to modernize or replace 4 of the investments. The lack of specific plans could result in wasteful spending on moderate- and high-risk investments. In instances where investments experience problems, agencies can perform a TechStat, a face-to-face meeting to terminate or turn around IT investments that are failing or not producing results. OMB directs agencies to monitor O&M investments through operational analyses, which should be performed annually. assess costs, schedules, whether the investment is still meeting customer and business needs, and investment performance. Table 5 provides details on the 23 investments and whether the operational analyses and TechStats were performed. Although not required, agencies had performed TechStats on only five of the at-risk investments. Agencies provided several reasons for not conducting TechStats. Several of the investments’ risk levels were reduced to low or moderately-low risk in the months since the IT Dashboard had been publicly updated.  Commerce's monthly process does not include all of the key elements of an operational analysis. DHS plans to perform the analysis on the investment in August 2017. Performing the analysis once the investment is operational will enable DHS to determine whether it is meeting the needs of the agency and delivering the expected value. The Director of Treasury’s Capital Planning and Investment Control program stated that the department’S policy does not require an analysis before an investment is made. The Integrated Fixed Towers Program Manager stated that since the investment had only become operational in October 2015, an operationalAnalysis was not yet required. infrastructure investments to have an operational analysis performed. OMB’s guidance on operational analyses does not exclude infrastructure investments. Numerous old investments are using obsolete programming languages. Several agencies, such as the Department of Justice (Justice), DHS, HHS, Treasury, USDA, and VA, reported using Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL)—a programming language developed in COBOL. Until agencies ensure that their O&M investments are fully reviewed, the government’'s oversight of old and vulnerable investments will be impaired. the late 1950s and early 1960s—to program their legacy systems. It is widely known that agencies need to move to more modern, maintainable languages. In 2010, Gartner noted that there should be a shift in focus to using more modern languages for new products. Some legacy systems may use parts that are obsolete and more difficult to find. For instance, Defense is still using 8-inch floppy disks in a legacy system. For more information, go to Defense.gov. that coordinates the operational functions of the United States’ nuclear forces. Further, in some cases, the vendors no longer provide support for hardware or software, creating security vulnerabilities and additional costs. For example, each of the 12 selected agencies reported using unsupported operating systems and components in their fiscal year 2014 reports. Commerce, Defense, DOT, HHS, and VA reported using 1980s and 1990s Microsoft operating systems that stopped being supported by the vendor more than a decade ago. Lastly, legacy systems may become increasingly more expensive as agencies have to deal with the previously mentioned issues and may pay a premium to hire staff or contractors with the knowledge to maintain outdated systems. For example, one agency (SSA) reported re-hiring retired employees to maintain its COBOL systems. Selected agencies reported that they continue to maintain old investments in O&M. Table 6 shows the 10 oldest investments and/or systems, as reported by selected agencies. Agencies reported having plans to modernize or replace each of these investments and systems. or tentative in that the agencies did not provide specific time frames, activities to be performed, or functions to be replaced or enhanced. For a full list of the agencies’ reported oldest systems, see appendix IV. Separately, we profiled one system or investment from each of the 12 selected agencies. The selected systems and investments range from 11 to approximately 56 years old, and serve a variety of purposes. For example, Treasury’s Individual Master File was first initiated about 56 years ago and is the authoritative data source for individual taxpayer accounts. DOT’s profiled system was initiated about 46 years ago and allows the agency to maintain comprehensive information on hazardous materials incidents. Of the 12 investments or systems, agencies had plans to replace or modernize 11 of these. However, the plans for 3 of those were general or tentative in that the agencies did not provide specificity on time frames, activities to be performed, or functions to be replaced or enhanced. The profiles of these systems and investments are available on the DOT's website. Agencies are not required to identify, evaluate, and prioritize their O&M investments to determine whether they should be kept as-is, modernized, replaced, or retired. Of the more than $80 billion that the 26 agencies reported spending for federal IT in fiscal year 2015, the agencies spent about $61 billion on O &M. Several of the 12 selected agencies’ major O&m investments were rated as moderate or high risk. Several aging investments are using unsupported components, many of which did not have specific plans for modernization. direct the respective agency CIO to ensure that required analyses are performed on investments in the operations and maintenance phase. We recommend that the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, State, the Treasury, Transportation, and Veterans Affairs identify and plan to modernize or replace legacy systems as needed. We received comments on a draft of this report from OMB and the other 12 agencies in our review. Eight agencies agreed with our recommendations, Defense and Energy partially agreed, and Justice and the Treasury stated they had no comment on the recommendations. reviewed IT Dashboard data on O&M investments to identify those that were rated as moderate to high risk by the agency chief information officer (CIO) We reviewed agency documentation such as TechStat documentation and operational analyses that had been performed on the investments, as available. In addition, we interviewed agency officials to determine plans for replacing or modernizing the investments. To assess the age and obsolescence of federal IT, we reviewed documentation associated with their legacy investments, such as operational analyses and enterprise architecture documents. that agencies provide a list of their three oldest systems. In some cases, agencies reported that they do not track the ages of individual systems. Agencies noted that these systems and investments may have components that are newer than their operational age. We also compared OMB and agencies’ current practices with federal guidance, such as OMB’s Circular No. A-11: Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget and its associated supplement on capital assets, to determine whether they are adequately managing the age and obsolescence. of federal IT. To select systems or investments to profile, we identified agencies’ existing investments in O&M that were rated as medium or high risk. We then interviewed agency officials to confirm and obtain additional information on the systems. From the resulting list of systems and investments, we created a list of the agency-identified oldest systems. We also used the list of agency- identified oldest systems or Investments to identify the oldest investments in the federal IT system. The list of oldest systems and Investments was then used to select the agencies to profile. we selected one system or investment per agency using the following factors: investment type (major or non- major), system or Investment age, and risk level as of November 2015. We also reviewed agency documentation and interviewed agency officials on those profiled systems or investments. To assess the reliability of the OMB budget data and IT Dashboard data, we reviewed related documentation, such as OMB guidance on budget preparation, capital planning, and other topics. We sought to have a mix of systems and investments that included both major and non-major investment types and a range of ages. and IT Dashboard submissions. In addition, we corroborated with each agency that the data downloaded were accurate and reflected the data it had reported to OMB. We conducted this performance audit from April 2015 to May 2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions. We determined that the budget and IT Dashboards data were reliable for our purposes of reporting IT O&M spending. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Table 8 provides the reported spending by agency on operations and maintenance (O&M) and the percentage of IT spending on O&M for fiscal years 2010 and 2015. Table 9 lists the 51 federal bureaus which reported spending less than 10 percent of their IT funds on development, modernization, and enhancement in fiscal year 2015. As part of this review, we requested that agencies provide a list of their three oldest systems. track the ages of individual systems, and as a result, we requested that the agency provide their 3 oldest IT investments and their approximate age. Table 10 provides a listing these systems or investments, as reported by agencies. We selected one system or investment per agency using a combination of factors including investment type (major or non-major), system or Investment age, and risk level as of November 2015. In particular, we sought to have a mix of systems and investments that included both major and non- major investment types, a range of ages, and aRange of risk ratings. The investment is a commercial off-the-shelf system that runs on Windows and Unix servers using Oracle’s PeopleSoft applications. The investment uses the PeopleSoft Supply Chain Management and PeopleSoft Financials modules. According to an agency official in Savannah River Operations, the investment will be used to manage 13,000 employees and pensioners at the Savannah River Site. It will also manage human resources, transparent financial reporting to Energy, supply chain, and project management, the official said. vendors still support all of the hardware and software used by this investment. The agency is not currently planning future modernization activity because the investment has gone through several updates in the past. The officials stated that there is no projected end of life date, and they plan to continue to maintain and use the system. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has 14,000 Coast Guard users and also services the Transportation Security Administration. The investment start date: 1998 Age: 18. The last allowed the retirement of 16 associated legacy applications in 2011 and retired two mainframes. Core Accounting System (CAS) Suite is the primary financial management system for the U.S. Coast Guard. CAS is a set of several applications that assist the agencies in several areas, including accounts. Agency plans to transition to federal shared services in fiscal year 2018. The agency's total estimated life-cycle costs are $543.2 million. The U.N. Security Council has approved the use of CAS for the Coast Guard, TSA and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) CAS uses a version of Oracle Federal Financials software that was first available in 2004. The extended vendor support for the software ended in November 2013. The agency plans to pursue using other shared services to provide its financial management services and, therefore, began looking for a new provider of financial services to use in the near future. It plans to use a combination of cloud-based and on-premises services to offer its financial services in the long-term. It also plans to begin using a new vendor to provide financial services for the agency in 2015. The agencies agreed to a staggered transition of these services, with DNDO transitioning in fiscal year 2016, TSA in 2017, and USCG in 2018. Until the migration is complete and CAS can be decommissioned, USCG plans to resolve emergent issues and maintain applications. In the meantime, due to the costs associated with implementing a full fix and the impending transition to shared services,. USCG has accepted the security risks and will continue to use CAS until the transition is complete. The transition will take place in fiscal years 2016-17 and 2017-18. Diversity Visa Information System (DVIS) is an electronic case management system used by approximately 30 federal employees and contractor staff working at the Department of State’s (State) Kentucky Consular Center. It tracks and validate application information submitted by foreign nationals under the Diversity Visa immigration program. System start date: early 1990s Age: Approximately 26 years System anticipated end date: 2020 Fiscal year 2016 funding: about $164,000 Total estimated life-cycle costs: $2.4 million Development costs: Not tracked at. The DVIS interface software, PowerBuilder, is no longer supported by the vendor. According to State officials, the main challenges in maintaining DVIS’s aging technology are related to information security and infrastructure concerns. State plans to replace DVIS with a project called ConsularOne. The replacement effort is to begin in October 2018, State officials say. The cost of replacing DVIS at system level is not tracked at the system level, according to the State Department. The project is expected to be completed at an unknown time. and they plan to retire DVIS when appropriate. In the meantime, the department plans to upgrade the unsupported software to a new version, which is also not supported. Department of Transportation—Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration Number of users: 250 federal users, 547,000 active hazardous materials facilities, 10,000 pipeline operators, and several million potential facilities. Investment start date: 1970s Age: about 41 years Investment anticipated end date: 2018 Fiscal year 2016 funding : $6.7 million Total estimated life-cycle costs: $38.0 million The Department of Transportation’s (DOT) Hazardous Materials Information System maintains and provides access to comprehensive information on hazardous materials incidents, exemptions and approvals. The system consists of five modules that register carriers and shippers, document incidents involving hazardous materials, issue special permits, facilitate approvals and exemptions pertaining to safety regulations, and document standards. To replace legacy modules, and plan to retire the legacy modules by the end of fiscal year 2018, the system will be replaced by software applications and processes. used by the system have become outdated and costly to maintain. Officials stated that costs have increased due to maintaining the personnel with the knowledge to use these older applications. The costly applications include those for scanning, imaging, and documentation management. These applications are compartmentalized, so data is duplicated and not integrated. Finally, the system uses an application that is no longer supported by the manufacturer, which can cause security risks, among other issues. The system uses Kofax Indicius software to perform optical character recognition. on scanned hazardous materials incident reports; the software was no longer supported by the vendor, as of December 2014. DOT is in the process of updating the functions performed by the system. The new system’s modules are intended to be integrated, automated, and improve efficiency, effectiveness, and data quality. Further, the unsupported application is planned to be eliminated. While DOT does not have dates for when individual legacy modules will be retired, officials stated that they plan to have all the legacy modules retired by the end of fiscal year 2018. The Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS), Individual Master File (IMF) is the authoritative data source for individual taxpayer accounts. Within IMF, accounts are updated, taxes are assessed, and refunds are generated as required during each tax filing period. Virtually all IRS information system will be replaced by Customer Account Data Engine 2 at an unknown date. The IMF is expected to be retired by 2019. The IRS has approximately 230 million tax accounts. It is estimated to cost $135.4 million to replace. IMF was written in an outdated assembly language code and operates on a 2010 IBM z196/2817-m32 mainframe. This has resulted in difficulty delivering technical capabilities addressing identify theft and refund fraud, among other things. IRS plans to address these issues by replacing IMF with a new, modern mainframe in 2015. The new mainframe will be powered by a new IBM Z196/2717-M32 system. The IRS will also be replacing its current mainframe with a newer, more modern IBM z 196/2716-M31 system in 2016. IMF with the Customer Account Data Engine 2 (CADE 2) investment. The CADE 2 investment includes plans to re-engineer the IMF. However, the replacement date is currently unknown. In addition, we have previously reported on IRS’s difficulty in delivering planned capabilities on time and on budget. Further, a key phase of the replacement project was initially to be completed by March 2015, but IRS is currently planning to complete parts of this phase well. The IMF is the world's largest bank. The agency will continue to maintain two separate systems until the replacement is complete. The agency has general plans to continuously update the system. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ Medicare Appeals’ system is expected to be retired in 2020. The system is estimated to cost $99.6 million through fiscal year 2017, with $79.0 million in operations and maintenance costs. It has 1,900 system users and an estimated life-cycle cost of more than $100 million. It was built in 2005 and has an estimated age of 11 years. System is a case tracking system that is to facilitate maintenance and transfer of case specific data with regard to Medicare appeals through multiple levels of the appeal process. The system runs on a Solaris 10 operating system, last updated in February 2016, and uses commercial off-the-shelf systems for case management and reporting. According to the agency, the software is still supported by the vendors. TheSystem has faced challenges due to the rapid growth in Medicare appeals and the number of people seeking treatment. appeals processed each year, expanded use of settlements, and the increased interest in appeals data. This has resulted in an increased need for infrastructure changes, such as more storage, licenses, and processing capacity. Agency officials stated that they do not have any plans to address these gaps and that doing so is contingent on funding. They also noted general plans to continuously update the system, but they too are contingent on receiving funding. Number of users: Thousands of users across the federal, state, and local levels, in addition to those in the international. The National Weather Service Telecommunication Gateway (NWSTG) system is operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The agency plans to retire the system in fiscal year 2017 and replace it with a new system. It is the nation’s hub for the collection and distribution of weather data and products and provides information to the public and academic communities. The NWSTG system has a life-cycle cost of $282.8 million, including $35.4 million for development and $247 million for operations and maintenance. National and global real-time exchange services using automated communications resources to collect and distribute a wide variety of environmental data. Thousands of customers worldwide use data distributed by the NWSTG and these data affect a wide range of economic and emergency management decisions. Concerns with the system had been increasing because the investment faced risks and challenges associated with an aging and unsupportable infrastructure, limited backup capability, and un-scalable architecture to support future data volume collection and dissemination. In 2013, the agency upgraded its hardware and software to Power7 IBM servers and Unix. operating systems (as depicted in the figure); however, NWSTG still lacks full backup capability for 26 percent of its functions. In fiscal year 2013, a major rearchitecture and redesign effort began which, according to Department of Commerce officials, will result in an entirely new dissemination architecture. According to officials, a detailed project plan is now being carried out and is scheduled to replace theNWSTG in early fiscal year 2017. The Personnel and Accounting Integrated Data will be replaced with an integrated system that is more capable, more reliable and have 100 percent backup capability. PAID system automates time and attendance for employees, timekeepers, payroll, and supervisors in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) The PAID software has three major modules: Time and Attendance, Employee Master Record Downloads, and Education Tracking. System start date: 1963 Age: 53 years System anticipated end date: 2017 Fiscal year 2016 funding: $6.7 million Total estimated life-cycle costs: n/a, not tracked by system. Operations and maintenance costs: $ 6.6 million yearly. PAID is a 50-year old COBOL-based system at the end of its life span. The system runs on IBM mainframes and uses an IBM database. Officials stated the system is not user friendly and requires extensive training in order to use the system successfully. VA officials stated that PAID is intended to be mostly replaced by the Human Resources Information System Shared Service Center. The center will consolidate several IT services to provide core human resources- related functions. It is expected to be completed by 2015. Human Resources Information System Shared Service Center in 2017 is to consolidate human resources IT functions and services. However, the target solution is experiencing cost overruns of $14.8 million and VA officials stated that they will not be able to replace all of PAID’s functions. The agency is currently working on a transition plan and will determine whether VA should find another solution for the missing functionality or continue to keep PAID running indefinitely. The U.S. Department of Agriculture”s (USDA) U.s. Forest Service’S Resource Ordering and Status System is being replaced by PAID. ROSS is used to mobilize and deploy a multitude of resources, including qualified individuals, teams, aircraft, equipment, and supplies. The technology used by ROSS is on the verge of technical obsolescence. One of the applications ROSS uses is no longer supported by the vendor, creating vulnerability issues. In addition, in order to use the system, users must download client software. The system supports the basic needs of the first responders and support personnel at an incident location by processing orders and replenishing supplies. onto their local computers, as opposed to accessing the system through the web. In September 2015, the U.S. Forest Service issued a request for information for services to develop ROSS’s replacement. Agency officials estimated that this effort will cost $14 million through fiscal year 2019 and the solution will go live in 2018. In January 2016, Forest Service officials signed a charter to begin this project. The project is expected to be completed in 2018, with a cost estimate of $12 million to $15 million. Sentry is a real-time information system comprised of various modules. It provides information regarding security and custody levels, inmate program and work assignments, and other pertinent information about the inmate population. Sentry is used by the Bureau of Prisons to maintain proper custody of persons committed to their custody. The system is expected to be fully operational by September 2016. It has a life-cycle cost of $571.5 million and plans to update the user interface and integrate system data through September 2016, the agency says. When Sentry was first deployed over 30 years ago, it was comprised of approximately 700 program routines written in COBOL. It became increasingly more difficult and expensive to maintain complex, highly-customized systems written in older programming languages. Sentry’s mainframe operating system, transaction processing software, the system software, and the database software and system were recently updated in 2012 and uses Java and a new database. As part of this, the bureau is using Java to process inmates at all phases of incarceration. migrated the older database, merged the legacy data into the newer database platform. modified the COBOL programs to ensure compatibility with the new software and database. The bureau has plans for updating the user interface and integrating the data through September 2016. According to agency officials, there are no plans to replace Sentry, as the system is the main system used by the bureau.. Department of Defense—Air Force Number of users: 175 users across the agency's various branches, including the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps. The Strategic Automated Command and Control System is the Department of Defense’s (Defense) dedicated high-speed data transmission, processing, and display system. The system coordinates functions for intercontinental ballistic missiles, bombers, tankers, munitions sites, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms. Defense is initiating a $60 million full system replacement which is scheduled to be completed in fiscal year 2020. The total estimated life-cycle costs: $135 million through 2032 and $75 million for operations and maintenance. For those in the nuclear command area, the system’s primary function is to send and receive emergency action messages to nuclear forces. The system is still running on an IBM Series/1 Computer, which is a 1970s computing system, and written in assembly language code. It also uses 8-inch floppy disks, which are a1970s-era computing system. The U.S. nuclear system is made up of technologies and equipment that are at the end of their useful lives. storage device; and assembly programming code typically used in mainframes. Replacement parts for the system are difficult to find because they are now obsolete. As of March 2016, Defense is initiating a $60 million full system replacement which is scheduled to be completed in fiscal year 2020. In addition to replacing some legacy functions in the near term, there is a plan underway to replace the floppy disks with secure digital cards. This effort is underway and is expected to be complete in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. Services general public, 1,300+ field offices with 50,000 to 60,000 employees. System start date: 1985 Age: 31 years Investment anticipated end date: None Fiscal year 2016 funding: $9.6 million Total estimated life-cycle costs (through fiscal year 2017): $519.8 million Development costs: $235.7 million Operations and maintenance costs: £284.1 million Plans for retirement or modernization: Agency has ongoing modernization efforts. The Social Security Administration’s (SSA) Title II investment includes the Title II system which determines retirement benefits eligibility and amounts. officials, the Title II investment accomplished its goal to improve service delivery by eliminating antiquated Title II programs. SSA officials stated that Title II is comprised of 162 subsystems and some are still written in COBOL. These systems were also built in a compartmentalized structure by SSA, rather than contractors, because the agency determined that there were not commercial programs that could satisfy the agency’s business needs and the volume of data needed. Most of the employees who developed these systems are ready to use them. SSA does not have plans to retire the Title II system. Rather, the agency plans to continue to eliminate and replace Title II’s older and more costly subsystems. SSA currently is planning to retire four Title II subsystems, including a claims control system, and one that processes changes in earnings transactions. In addition, SSA has other efforts to modernize or consolidate Title II systems, such as its database management systems.retire and the agency will lose their collective knowledge. issues associated with losing knowledgeable employees. SSA officials stated that the agency has rehired retirees to work on the legacy systems.

Summary:
Most residential users dial in to an ISP over a telephone line. Large businesses often purchase dedicated lines that connect directly to Internet backbone networks. For a residential customer, the ISP sends the user’s Internet traffic on to the backbone network. To perform this function, ISPs obtain direct connections to one or more Internet backbone providers. Small business users may also connect to a backbone network through an ISP, however, large businesses often buy dedicated lines. For small business users, a dedicated line that connects directly to the Internet backbone network is more common. provider’s network at a facility known as a “point of presence.” Backbone providers have points of presence in varied locations, although they concentrate these facilities in more densely-populated areas. Figure 1 depicts two hypothetical Internet backbone networks that link at interconnection points and take traffic to and from residential users through ISPs and directly from large business users. Once on an Internet backbone network, digital data is able to reach distant points of Presence over telecommunications lines. If an ISP or end user is far from a point of presence, it is able from there to access other parts of the network. signals that were split into separate pieces or “packets” at the transmission point are separately routed over the most efficient available pathway and reassembled at their destination point. The standards that specify most data transmissions are known as the Internet Protocol (IP) Suite. Under part of this protocol, streams of packets are routed to their destination over themost efficient pathway. Other aspects of the protocol facilitate the routing of packets to their appropriate destination by examining the 32-bit numeric identifier— or IP address—attached to every packet. Currently, IP addresses for North America are allocated by the American Registry for Boardwatch reports 41 backbone providers with a national network and many other regional backbones. Approximately five to eight of these national providers are considered to be “Tier 1” backbone providers. Unlike telecommunications services, the provision of Internet backbone service is not regulated by governmental communications agencies. A Tier 1 provider is defined by Boardwatch as having a network of wide geographic scope, having many IP addresses, having extensive information for traffic routing determinations, and handling a large percentage of transmissions. For more information, visit Boardwatch. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 sought to increase competition in other communications sectors, primarily the local telephone market. No provisions were contained in the 1996 act pertaining to Internet backbone services. However, the act did provide for the creation of a “telecommunications’ and “information” commission. The commission was created to regulate the Internet backbone market, but it was later expanded to include all Internet services, including voice and data services. The agency is now looking at how to regulate data-processing services on the Internet. treatment of these more established communications services and infrastructures under the Communications Act of 1934 has indirectly affected the Internet medium. Two types of facilities are used for the exchange of data traffic by interconnected Internet backbone providers. The first type of facility, known as a “network access point” (NAP), enables numerous backbone providers to interconnect with each other at a common facility. Internet data traffic is also exchanged at the NAP. The act provided FCC and states the authority to take actions to encourage the deployment of advanced telecommunications capability. Two types of financial arrangements exist among backbone providers for traffic exchanges. In a “peering” relationship, backbone providers exchange data destined only for each other’s network generally without the imposition of a fee. Transit payments, which involve the payment by one backbone provider to another for the mutual exchange of traffic and for the delivery of traffic to other providers, have become more common with time. A NAP facilitates the interconnection of multiple backbone providers. In the early to mid-1990s, the NAPs were common. National Science Foundation designed and partially funded four NAPs, each of which was managed by a different company. Since that time, other interconnection points have been constructed, and for purposes of this report, the term "NAPs" refers to approximately 10 major traffic exchange points that host backbone providers. NAP's are not uniform facilities; differences exist in terms of equipment, software, and data transmission rates. In the first years of their existence, Naps became congested with the rapid rate of growth. in Internet traffic. Two of the providers with whom we spoke said that some NAPs were not well managed. If traffic exchange at a NAP became congested, service quality could be compromised. Two typical problems that congestion causes include latency (delay in the transmission of traffic) and packet loss (when transmitted data are actually lost and never reach their destination). For example, one backbone provider told us that the loss of data was so great that the company had to shut down its network.  congestion and poor quality of connections at the NAPs led backbone providers to engage in another type of traffic exchange known as “private interconnection.” Private interconnection refers to the exchange of traffic at a place other than a NAP. Of 17 backbone providers with whom we spoke, 15 used both N APs and private interconnections. Only one company said that it was likely to make greater use of Naps in the future. of the 17 companies that we met with, 10 provided estimates of how their mix of private interconnection and NAP use would likely change. While peering generally entails traffic exchange between two providers without payment, transit entails payment by one provider to another for carrying traffic. Transit agreements constitute a supplier-customer relationship between some backbone providers. Currently, there is a segregation of backbone providers into “tiers’ The top tier or “Tier 1” providers generally peer with each other and sell transit to smaller backbone providers, the authors say. The “tiering” of Internet backbone providers and the dual system of peering and transit agreements have caused controversies. Market forces may be relieving some of these problems, authors say. No official data sources were identified that would provide information on the structure and competitiveness of the Internet backbone market. Some non-Tier 1 backbone providers do not want to peer with the largest backbone providers, they say. The choice of local telephone companies providing access to Internet backbone networks may be limited, the authors say, creating problems for providers of Internet services. They say FCC does solicit public comments on the deployment of underlying telecommunications infrastructure. Internet backbone market appears to be competitive, but another market may be less so. Most ISPs and other end users connect to a backbone provider’s point of presence through the local telecommunications infrastructure. These systems are typically owned and operated by incumbent telephone companies. Many of the market participants with whom we spoke noted that local telephone markets are, in their view, close to monopolistic. Some companies spoke with concern about slow deployment of high-speed Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) service in rural areas.

Summary:
The key objectives of U.S. public diplomacy are to engage, inform, and influence overseas audiences. Public diplomacy is carried out through a wide range of programs that employ person-to-person contacts. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, State has expanded its public diplomacy efforts. The State Department’s efforts have focused on foreign elites. However, the dramatic growth in global mass communications and other trends have forced a rethinking of this approach, and State has begun to consider techniques for communicating with broader foreign audiences. its public diplomacy efforts globally, focusing particularly on countries in the Muslim world considered to be of strategic importance in the war on terror. In May 2006, we reported that this trend continued with funding increases of 25 percent for the Near East and 39 percent for South Asia from 2004 to 2006. The BBG supports U.S. public diplomacy’s key objectives by broadcasting news and information about the United States and world affairs. It serves as a model of how a free press should operate. State and the BBG spent close to $1.5 billion on public diplomacy programs in fiscal year 2006. As others have previously reported, in recent years anti-American sentiment has spread and intensified. For instance, favorable attitudes toward the United States in Indonesia declined from 75 percent in 2000 to 30 percent in 2006 and from 52 percent to 40 percent in 2005. The Pew Global Attitudes Project has found that the decline in favorable opinion of the U.S. is a worldwide trend.. to 12 percent over the same time period in Turkey. Numerous experts, expert groups, policymakers, and business leaders have expressed concerns that anti-Americanism may harm U.S. interests in various ways. While individual opinion polls may reflect a snapshot in time, consistently negative polls may. reflect the development of more deeply seated sentiments about the United States. The Council on Foreign Relations has claimed that the loss of goodwill may harm the U.N.’s ability to influence world leaders. The Defense Science Board states that “damaging consequences for other elements of U.s. soft power are tactical manifestations of a pervasive atmosphere of hostility” Anti-American sentiments may negatively affect American economic interests, U.S. foreign policy and military operations, and the security of Americans. According to Business for Diplomatic Action, anti-Americanism can cause boycotts of American products, a backlash against American brands, and increased security costs. A report from the Princeton-based Working Group on Anti-Americansism also found that anti-America sentiments have had a negative impact on U.s. security and foreign policy. The report was based on a survey of more than 1,000 people. The Travel Business Roundtable has reported significant declines in the U.S. market share of the worldwide travel market and a decline in overseas visitors to the United States since 9/11. According to the Defense Science Board, the Brookings Institution, and others, anti-Americanism around the world may reduce the U.-S.’s ability to pursue its foreign policy goals, including efforts to foster diplomatic relationships with other foreign leaders and to garner support for the global war on terror. The Council on Foreign Relations also has identified potential consequences of anti- Americanism on the security of individual Americans. U.S. public diplomacy efforts seek to counter anti-Americanism sentiment. State Department has not yet developed a comprehensive strategy to guide the Department’s efforts to engage the private sector. State has begun to take credible steps towards instituting more systematic performance measurement practices, consistent with recommendations GAO and others have made. State indicated that the interagency public diplomacy strategy will address assessment of marking and publicity programs and will include governmentwide marks and publicity guidance. The administration has made a number of unsuccessful attempts to develop such a strategy. the absence of such research, programs may lack important information about appropriate target audiences and credible messages and messengers. Based on prior reports by GAO and others, the department has begun to institute a more concerted effort to measure the impact of its programs and activities. The department created (1) the Office of Policy, Planning, and Resources within the office of the Under Secretary. The Public Diplomacy Evaluation Council to share best practices. The Department established an expanded evaluation schedule that is designed to cover all major public diplomacy programs. department also has called on program managers to analyze and define their key inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes, and impact to help identify meaningful performance goals and indicators. In 2001, the BBG introduced a market-based approach to international broadcasting that sought to “marry the mission to the market.” This approach was designed to generate large listening audiences in priority markets. The department recently launched a pilot public diplomacy performance measurement data collection project that is designed to collect, document, and quantify reliable annual and long-term outcome performance measures. The Board’s vision is to create a flexible, multimedia, research-driven U.S. international broadcasting system. Implementing this strategy has focused on markets relevant to the war on terrorism, in particular in the Middle East through such key initiatives as Radio Sawa and the Alhurra TV network. The BBG subsequently created a new strategic plan to implement its new approach. We found that the plan did not include a single goal or related program objective designed to gauge progress toward increasing audience size. The strategy focuses on the need to reach large audiences in priority markets. single strategic goal to focus on the key objective of maximizing impact in priority areas of interest to the United States. However, we found that weaknesses in the BBG’s audience surveys create uncertainty over whether some of Radio Sawa’S or Alhurra's performance targets for audience size have been met. We recommended that the Middle East Broadcasting Networks be re-evaluated by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. We found that methodological concerns call into question the potential accuracy of this key performance measure. BBG accept our recommendation and has informed us that it is currently considering how it will do so. Public diplomacy efforts in the field face several other challenges. Post officials have consistently cited a general lack of staff, insufficient administrative support, and inadequate language training. The BBG’s disparate organizational structure has been viewed as a key challenge. The U.S. State Department has a responsibility to improve its public diplomacy efforts, the authors say. They recommend the BBG improve its audience research methods, including identifying significant methodological limitations. State Department had 887 established public diplomacy positions (overseas and domestic) as of March 31, 2007, but 199, or roughly 22 percent, were vacant. Compounding this challenge is the loss of public diplomacy officers to temporary duty in Iraq, which, according to one State official, is a major problem. Several embassy officials stated that, with current staffing levels, they do not have the capacity to effectively utilize increased funds. The U.S. State Department has a responsibility to focus and direct its international broadcasting efforts. Staffing shortages may also limit the amount of training public diplomacy officers receive. Public diplomacy officers at posts are burdened with administrative tasks, and thus have less time to conduct public diplomacy outreach activities than they did previously. One senior State official said that administrative tasks have drawn down field officers even further. The number of field officers has remained the same in fiscal years 2004 and 2006, the State Department says. The State Department is repositioning several public diplomacy Officers as part of its transformational diplomacy initiative. duties, such as budget, personnel, and internal reporting, compete with officers’ public diplomacy responsibilities. Another official in Egypt stated that she rarely had enough time to strategize, plan, or evaluate her programs. These statements echo comments we heard during overseas fieldwork and in a survey for our 2003 report. In that survey, officers stated that, although they manage to attend public outreach and other functions within their host country capitals, it was particularly difficult to find time to travel outside the capitals to interact with other communities. The average length of tour at posts in the Muslim world is about 22 percent shorter than tour lengths elsewhere. Public affairs officers who have shorter tours tend to produce less effective work than officers with longer tours, a senior official at State said. In our May 2006 report, we reported that the prevalence of 1-year tours in theMuslim world was high. To see the full report, go to CNN.com/soulmatestories. To read the rest of the report, click here: http://www.cnn.org/2006/01/29/world/features/world-diplomat-tours-in-mideast. GAO: State Department continues to experience significant foreign language proficiency shortfalls in countries around the world. Report noted this problem was particularly acute at posts in the Muslim world where Arabic—classified as a “superhard” language by State—predominates. Officials at State said that the Management bureau is currently considering options for reducing the administrative burden on posts, including the development of centralized administrative capabilities offshore. In 2003, GAO recommended that the Secretary of State designate more administrative positions to overseas public affairs sections. countries with significant Muslim populations. In Arabic language posts, about 36 percent of language- designated public diplomacy positions were filled by staff unable to speak Arabic at the designated level. In addition, State officials said that there are even fewer officers who are willing or able to speak on television or engage in public debate in Arabic. The information officer in Cairo stated that his office does not have enough Arabic speakers to engage with the public in public debates in the city. The State Department said that the number of Arabic speakers in Cairo has declined over the past few years. State has begun to address these language deficiencies by increasing its overall amount of language training and providing supplemental training for more difficult languages at overseas locations. State has also made efforts to ensure that its public diplomacy staff receive appropriate language training. For example, State’s Foreign Service Institute recently offered a week of intensive media training for language-qualified officers that provided guidance on how to communicate with Arabic-speaking audiences. Security concerns have limited embassy outreach, and the State Department is working to address this. Security concerns are particularly elevated in countries with significant Muslim populations. Threat level for terrorism is rated as “critical” or “high” in 80 percent of posts. Security and budgetary concerns have led to the closure of publicly accessible facilities around the world, such as the U.S. Embassy in Cairo. The U.N. has a responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of its personnel and their families, and to protect its facilities and facilities from harm. The United Nations has a duty to protect the safety of its citizens and its facilities. as American Centers and Libraries. In Pakistan, for example, all American Centers have closed for security reasons; the last facility, in Islamabad, closed in February 2005. These same concerns have prevented establishing a U.S. presence elsewhere. As a result, embassies have had to find other venues for public diplomacy programs. Some activities have been moved onto embassy compounds, where precautions designed to improve security have had the ancillary effect of sending the message that the United States is unapproachable and distrustful. use of cell phones and pagers within the embassy. According to one official in Pakistan, visitors to the embassy’s reference library have declined to as few as one per day. Other public diplomacy programs have had to limit their publicity to reduce the risk of becoming a target. A recent joint USAID-State report concluded that “security concerns often require a ‘low profile’ approach during events, programs or other situations.” This constraint is a result of the U.S. decision to limit the use of pagers and cell phones in the embassy, the report said. particularly acute in Pakistan, where the embassy has had to reduce certain speaker and exchange programs. State has responded to security concerns and the loss of publicly accessible facilities through a variety of initiatives. American Corners are centers that provide information about the United States, hosted in local institutions and staffed by local employees. According to State data, there are currently 365American Corners throughout the world, including more than 200 in the Muslim world. However, two of the posts we visited in Pakistan were closed. October 2005 were having difficulty finding hosts for American Corners, as local institutions fear becoming terrorist targets. The Broadcasting Board of Governors has its own set of public diplomacy challenges, including trying to gain large audiences in priority markets. As noted in the BBG’s strategic plan, “diverse organizations with different missions, different frameworks, and different constituencies’ makes it a challenge to bring all the separate parts together in a more effective whole” As we reported in July 2003, the Board hoped to. address this key challenge through two primary means. First, it planned to treat the component parts of U.S. international broadcasting as a single system with the Board in the position of actively managing resources across broadcast entities. Second, it intended to realign the BBG’s organizational structure to reinforce the CEO with a host of responsibilities. In addition, in 2006, we found that MBN, which received $79 million in, was the largest broadcaster in the United States, followed by ABC. funding in fiscal year 2006, faces several managerial and editorial challenges that may hinder the organization’s efforts to expand in their highly competitive market. While MBN has taken steps to improve its process of program review and evaluation, it has not yet implemented our recommendations. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement. I would be happy to respond to any questions you or other members of the subcommittee may have at this time. For questions regarding this testimony, please contact Jess T.

Summary:
After 9/11, responding to potential and real threats to homeland security became one of the federal government’s most significant challenges. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 merged 22 federal agencies and organizations into DHS, making it the department with the third largest budget. In January 2003, we designated implementation and transformation of the new Department of Homeland Security as high risk based on three factors: (1) the implementation, (2) the funding, and (3) the political will of Congress. and transformation of DHS is an enormous undertaking that will take time to achieve in an effective and efficient manner. Failure to effectively carry out its mission would potentially expose the nation to very serious consequences. One of the department’s key challenges is integrating the components’ respective financial management systems, many of which were outdated and had limited functionality, as well as addressing weaknesses from the inherited components. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 states that DHS’S missions include, to protect the U.S. among other things, preventing terrorist attacks within the United States, reducing America’s vulnerability to terrorism, minimizing subsequent damage, and assisting in the recovery from attacks that do occur. To help accomplish this integrated homeland security mission, the various mission areas and associated programs of 22 federal agencies were merged, in whole or in part, into DHS. The department's organizational structure consists of eight major components, each of which is headed by an Under Secretary. The U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard), the U.s. Secret Service, the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS), and five directorates are headed by Under Secretaries. Within the Management Directorate is DHS’s Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) OCFO is assigned primary responsibility for functions, such as budget, finance and accounting, strategic planning and evaluation. OCFO also charged with ongoing integration of these functions within the department. The CFO Act requires the agency's CFO to develop and maintain an integrated accounting and financial management system that provides for complete, reliable, and timely financial information that facilitates the systematic measurement of performance at the agency. The act also requires that the agency’s CFO be qualified, presidentially appointed, approved by the Senate, and report to the head of the agency. FFMIA requires that agencies implement and maintain financial management systems that substantially comply with federal financial management system requirements, applicable accounting standards, and the U.S. Government Standard General Ledger at the transaction level. While not required to comply with provisions of the CFO Act, agencies must comply with the requirements of the act. the CFO Act or FFMIA, the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002, requires DHS to prepare and have audited financial statements annually. The President’s Management Agenda recognized that an unqualified financial audit opinion is a basic prescription for any well-managed organization. Without sound internal control and accurate and timely financial information, it is not possible to accomplish the agenda and secure the best performance and highest performance, the White House said. The White House did not require DHS to comply with the CFO act. measure of accountability for the American people. Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP) Principals have defined certain measures, in addition to receiving an unqualified financial statement opinion. These additional measures include being able to routinely provide timely, accurate, and useful financial and performance information, having neither material internal control weaknesses nor material noncompliance with laws and regulations. DHS obtained a consolidated financial audit for the 7-month period from March 1, 2003, to September 30, 2003. DHS received a qualified opinion from its independent auditors on its financial performance. When DHS was created in March 2003 and merged with 22 diverse agencies, there were many known financial management weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the inherited agencies. Auditors were unable to opine on the consolidated statements of net costs and changes in net position, combined statement of budgetary resources, and consolidated statement of financing. The auditors reported 14 reportable conditions on internal control, 7 of which were considered to be material weaknesses. Most of the 22 components that transferred to DHS had not been subjected to significant financial statement audit scrutiny prior to their transfer. Nine of the 30 internal control weaknesses identified in prior component financial statement audits have been closed as of September 30, 2003. The remaining 21 issues represent continuing weaknesses that have been reported in DHS’s first Performance and Accountability Report. Nine of these were combined and reported as 3 material weaknesses, while 5 were reported as reportable conditions. Several of the departmentwide weaknesses resulted from combining previously identified weaknesses or reclassifying them, rather than from resolving the underlying internal control problems. FEMA, FEMA, and TSA each had weaknesses that while not material to DHS on a departmentwide basis, need to be addressed. We have found that similar projects have proven challenging and costly for other federal agencies. NASA is on its third attempt in 12 years to modernize its financial management process and systems. DC Courts struggled in developing requirements that contained the necessary specificity to ensure the system developed would meet its users’ needs. It is too early to tell whether DHS’s planned financial enterprise solution will be able to meet the requirements of relevant financial management laws it is currently not subject to. The goals of the CFO Act and FFMIA are to provide the Congress and agency management with reliable financial information.  auditors reviewed prior-period component agency annual financial statement audit reports when available. Key controls to ensure reporting integrity were not in place, and inefficiencies made the process more error prone. Several DHS bureaus lacked clearly documented procedures, making them vulnerable if key people leave the organization. The Coast Guard and the Strategic National Stockpile had weaknesses in financial oversight that have led to reporting problems. The auditors found weaknesses across DHS in its entitywide security program management and in controls over system access. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) lacked a comprehensive property management system. Internal controls over physical counts of OM&S were not effective at the Coast Guard. The Secret Service did not record the.documentation to support its estimation methodology. The Coast Guard also had not recently reviewed its OM &S capitalization policy, leading to a material adjustment to its records when an analysis was performed. The TSA lacked adequate policies and procedures to ensure the accuracy of its PP&E records. The auditors were unable to verify the recorded value of $497 million in OM & S. pension liability for certain of its employees and retirees, and when corrected, the auditors had insufficient time to audit the amount recorded. The Coast Guard also was unable to provide sufficient documentation to support the recorded value of $201 million in post-service benefit liabilities. DHS lacked controls to verify that monthly financial reports and transferred balances from legacy agencies were accurate and complete. The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) accounting system lacked automated controls to detect Drawback claims on duties, taxes, and fees. CBP did not have a reliable process of monitoring the movement of ‘in-bond’ shipments. CBP lacked an effective compliance measurement program to compute an estimate of underpayment of related duties, taxes, and fees. The Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services’ (CIS) process for tracking and reporting the status of applications and related information was inconsistent and inefficient. Also, CIS did not prevent excessive drawback claims and payments. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) failed to adequately monitor the movements of “in- bond” shipments, which are merchandise that is not subject to duties until it reaches its destination. perform cycle counts of its work in process that would facilitate the accurate calculation of deferred revenue. Fund balance with Treasury (FBWT): The Coast Guard did not perform required reconciliations for FBWT accounts and lacked written standard operating procedures (SOP) to guide the process. Intragovernmental balances: Several large DHS bureaus had not developed and adopted effective SOPs or established systems to track, confirm, and reconcile intragovernmentals balances and transactions. Strategic National Stockpile (SNS): The SNS accounting process was fragmented and disconnected, largely due to operational challenges caused by the laws governing SNS. A $485 million upwards adjustment had to be made to value SNS in DHS’s records properly. CIS and the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), TSA, and the Coast Guard had weaknesses in their processes for accruing accounts payable or reporting accurate balances for undelivered orders. SNS had a Material Weakness (Financial Systems Functionality and Technology) Reportable Condition (Drawback Claims on Duties, Taxes, and Fees) Condition (In-bond Movement of Imported Goods) Observation & Recommendations to Management Material Weakness (Financial Systems Functionality and Technology) Immigration and Naturalization Service (as of February 28, 2003) Reportable Condition (Acceptance and Adjudication of Immigration and naturalization Applications) Reportability Condition (Accounts Payable and Undelivered Orders) Material Weaknesses (Financial Reporting) Materialweakness ( financial reporting) Material weakness (Intragovernmental Balances) The Government Accountability Office is the audit, evaluation and investigative arm of Congress. GAO examines the use of public funds; evaluates federal programs and policies; and provides analyses, recommendations, and other assistance to help Congress make informed oversight, policy, and funding decisions. The GAO’s commitment to good government is reflected in its core values, which are set out in the agency's mission statement. The agency's core values are: "Accountability, transparency, and accountability for the American people" Each weekday, GAO posts newly released reports, testimony, and correspondence on its Web site.

Summary:
U.S. economy and security are heavily dependent on oil, natural gas, and other energy commodities. Nearly half of the nation’s oil is transported from overseas by tankers. Coast Guard seeks to mitigate many kinds of security challenges in the maritime environment. The FBI shares responsibility with the Coast Guard for preventing and responding to terrorist incidents, including incidents involving energy tankers, they say. They say the U.S., with limited authority, has limited authority to oversee the security of such vessels. The Coast Guard does not have data on the ability of an OCS facility to withstand an attack. The input for secondary economic impacts can have a substantial effect on how MSRAM’s output ranks a facility relative to other potential targets. The Coast Guard may recommend conducting more research on the vulnerability to and consequences of attack scenarios as a result of a study it is currently conducting on OCS facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. The study initially reviewed the “lessons learned” from Deepwater Horizon and how those lessons could be used. The Coast Guard did not conduct MSRAM assessments for all 50 of the OCS facilities that are subject to federal security requirements in 2011. Coast Guard officials added that they are working with DHS’s Office of Risk Management and Analysis in studying ways to improve how it assesses secondary economic impacts. Some facilities may drop below the production or personnel thresholds described earlier in this statement, thereby falling outside the scope of 33 C.F.R. part 106, or other facilities could meet or exceed such thresholds, thereby rendering them subject to part 106. Internal control standards state that such control activities are an integral part of an entity’s planning, implementing, reviewing, and accountability for stewardship of government resources. Developing such procedures could help ensure that the Coast Guard carries out its risk assessment requirements for such security- regulated OCS facilities. Challenges in assessing security risks to offshore energy infrastructure that is not subject to security requirements: With respect to OCS. facilities, analysts only use MSRAM to assess security risks associated with those O CS facilities that are regulated for security under 33 C.F.R. The Deepwater Horizon did not meet the threshold criteria subjecting it to regulation under part 106, and therefore, MSRAM was not used to assess its security risks. According to Coast Guard officials, mobile offshore drilling units (MODUs) do not generally pose a risk of a terrorist attack. There is little chance of an oil spill when these units are drilling and have not struck oil. However, there is a brief period of time when a MODUs can pose a threat to national security. drilling unit strikes a well, but the well has yet to be sealed prior to connecting it to a production facility. The Deepwater Horizon was in this stage when it resulted in such a large oil spill. MODUs could be at risk of a terrorist attack that could have significant consequences despite a facility not meeting production or personnel thresholds. For example, such risks could involve the reliability of blowout preventer valves. Gaining a fuller understanding of the security risks could help MODUs prevent future incidents. associated with MODUs, such as the Deepwater Horizon, could improve the quality of program decisions. MSRAM does not assess systemic or network risks because, according to Coast Guard officials, these types of assessments are beyond the intended use of MSRAM. The threat of terrorism against energy tankers and offshore energy infrastructure highlights the importance of the Coast Guard having policies and procedures in place to better ensure the security of OCS facilities, and deepwater ports. Improvements in security could help to prevent a terrorist attack against this infrastructure, which could have significant consequences. determined that some OCS facilities were not assessed, the Coast Guard has completed its assessments for the previously omitted facilities. Given that the list of security-regulated facilities may change each year based on factors such as production volume, it is important to ensure that any facilities added to the list in the future will be assessed for security risks in MSRAM. By revising policies and procedures to help ensure that an updated list of O CS facilities is provided to MSRAM analysts on an annual basis, the coast guard would be better positioned to ensure all risk assessments are carried out. facilities requiring such assessments be conducted in a manner consistent with the law and presidential directive. We recommend that the Commandant of the Coast Guard revise policies and procedures to ensure that MSRAM analysts receive the annual updated list of security- regulated OCS facilities. This testimony concludes our work on Coast Guard efforts to assess security risks for offshore energy infrastructure. However, we will continue our broader work looking at the security of offshore energy. infrastructure, including Coast Guard security inspections and other challenges. The Coast Guard concurred with our recommendation. We will continue to work with the Coast Guard to develop solutions to ensure that inspections of OCS facilities are completed as required. I would be happy to respond to any questions you may have. We are committed to working with the U.S. Coast Guard on all matters relating to maritime security and safety. We welcome your comments and suggestions on how to improve OCS operations. We look forward to hearing from you in the coming days and weeks.

Summary:
In September 2008, ongoing financial turmoil escalated into a financial panic. Large financial institutions, such as Lehman Brothers and AIG, were failing. The federal government responded with a series of lending and guarantee programs to mitigate the economic damage. Among the many policy responses, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) established the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) on October 14, 2008, to strengthen confidence and to encourage liquidity in the banking system. The TLGP had two parts: a debt guarantee program and a lending program. The TAG program currently provides unlimited deposit insurance for $1.4 trillion in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts. NIBTAs are accounts that do not pay interest and allow the depositor to make withdrawals without giving advanced notice to the bank. Although the DGP is no longer guaranteeing new debt, TAG continues to apply to new deposit balances. In spite of a loss, the TAG program will continue to provide coverage for depositors in spite of the loss of the Deposit Guarantee Program.  Deposit insurance brings stability to the banking sector by giving depositors confidence that if their bank fails, they will not lose the money in their insured accounts. Deposit insurance, however, also reduces the incentive of depositors to monitor their banks and ensure that their banks are not assuming unnecessary risks. The establishment of TAG, in addition to the existing deposit insurance and other measures taken by regulators, may have bolstered depositors' confidence in banks as reliable counterparties. Of confidence in other parts of the financial system, the insured banking sector saw few bank runs during the financial panic.  deposit insurance has historically had an upper limit on the amount insured to minimize this loss of market discipline. During the financial crisis, policymakers reassessed the tradeoff between the stability and the moral hazard created by deposit insurance. Extending deposit insurance to some uninsured accounts through TAG may have strengthened the banking system by discouraging some borrowers from withdrawing their deposits during the height of the financial stress. In addition to other regulatory efforts taken to minimize moral hazard, deposit insurance was extended to uninsured accounts during the crisis. Financial stress in 2012 is elevated compared with the lows of 2006 and 2007, but has fallen from the high points of the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009. The TAG program established by the FDIC expired on December 31, 2010, and was replaced on the same day by the TAG program as established by Section 343 of the Federal Reserve Act. The St. Louis Federal Reserve Financial Stress Index is an index composed of 18 data series that provides one measure of financial stress. The index is based on data from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank. The TAG program created by the FDIC was a voluntary program in which eligible financial institutions were automatically registered to participate. The Dodd-Frank Act, however, made all FDIC-insured banks part of TAG by temporarily changing "the definition of insured deposits to include the entire balance of noninterest-bearing transaction accounts" The " TAG program," therefore, refers to two similar but distinct programs. Though both TAG programs provided unlimited deposit insurance to NIBTAs, they also differ in several ways. Since TAG was first established, the amount of deposits insured by TAG has increased. On December 31, 2008, shortly after TAG was implemented, the program guaranteed approximately $722 billion. The Dodd-Frank Act's changes to the definition of insured deposits are temporary and due to expire on January 1, 2013. The unlimited deposit insurance for NIBTAs expires on that date and returns to the FDIC's $250,000 standard maximum deposit insurance amount, as explained by Maureen Murphy in CRS Legal Sidebar.  section 1105 of Dodd-Frank provides the FDIC with authority to institute a widely available program of emergency assistance. The authority appears to be limited to situations involving a liquidity crisis. The FDIC and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Fed Board) must make a detailed determination that a liquidity event exists and that failure to take action would have serious adverse effects on U.S. financial stability or economic conditions. WSLG37: Extending the FD IC's Transaction Account Guarantee Program Given the Uncertain Economic Outlook? The FDIC established TAG in 2008. Changes to FDIC's authority made by the Dodd-Frank Act may prevent the FDIC from having the option of extending TAG. An extension of TAG, therefore, may require congressional action. On November 26, 2012, Senator Harry Reid introduced S. 3637 , a bill to temporarily extend the TAG program for two years. NIBTAs constitute one of several cash management tools used by businesses, non-profits, governments, and other entities. If TAG expires, depositors may change their perception of the safety of NIBTAs. Changes in the financial and regulatory environment since 2008 could also result in a different allocation than the pre-TAG levels. Depositors would prefer to write checks to pay their vendors and employees. If TAG expires they may reevaluate how they allocate their money across the various options in theFinancial system. The use of NibTAs could return to pre- TAG levels if TAG expires. If it does not, they could be used to pay employees and vendors. to have more of all three, but face trade-offs. For example, there is a trade-off between safety and yield on an investment. To have a higher return, an investor may have to sacrifice liquidity (the ease with which an asset can be converted into cash) Certificates of deposit, for example, may pay a higher interest rate than a typical savings account, but there are restrictions on when the money can be used. The more at risk an investor's money is, the higher the possible return if the risk does not eventuate. be withdrawn. Depositors' preferences for safety, liquidity, and yield will determine how they allocate their money across the various options they face. NIBTAs have grown by approximately $1 trillion from $1.3 trillion in the third quarter of 2013. If TAG expires, depositors may choose to leave their deposits as uninsured deposits at their existing banks. If NIBtAs are withdrawn, the options available to depositors can be simplified to two general choices: (1) depositors could leave some or all of their money in the traditional, insured banking sector or (2) they could move some orall their money out of the traditional banking sector. quarter of 2008 (before TAG was implemented) to $2.3 trillion in the second quarter of 2012. NIBTAs were used at relatively high rates before TAG and their growth may not be due solely to the guarantee offered by TAG. Changes in economic and financial conditions since TAG was introduced may make NIB tas an appealing choice. The expiration of unlimited insurance may increase the risk of NIBtAs. But even without TAG, the high degree of liquidity offered by NibTAs may incentivize some borrowers to keep their money as uninsured deposits. uninsured deposits to various accounts in different insured banks so that each account is under the maximum insured level. Although this option may minimize risk, it would increase the transaction costs for the depositor. Some depositors may attempt to recapture the safety they would lose if TAG expires by shifting their deposits to safer banks, which for some may mean to one of the largest or most interconnected banks. Safer banks, such as those with higher capital levels or higher equity levels, may be more able to cope with the loss of TAG. with less concentration in a risky asset class, may be perceived as less likely to fail. Depositors may move their accounts to one of the largest or most interconnected banks if they believe those banks are in practice "too big to fail" (TBTF) A bank is said to be TBTF if policymakers are likely to judge that its failure would cause unacceptable disruptions to the overall financial system and would act to prevent failure. If a depositor thinks policymakers would not allow a particular bank to fail, they may move to another bank. table 1 shows statistics on TAG accounts by bank size. The largest banks have more accounts per institution and higher average account balances than smaller banks. Approximately 75% of TAG funds are in the 19 banks with more than $100 billion in assets, though those 19 banks account for 61% of total assets in the insured banking system. Even with TAG, if a bank is allowed to fail, then the depositor may view their uninsured deposits as safer than if the deposits were in a bank that would be allowed to failing. The largest banks hold a disproportionately large share of TAG accounts. The expiration of TAG may increase the concentration of deposits in the largest banks. When the FDIC version of TAG expired on December 31, 2010, 31% of banks opted out of the program. The percentage of each group that opted out is an indicator of the different views of large and small banks about the usefulness of TAG. The FDIC's TAG program was optional; at certain points banks were given the ability to opt out. with assets over $10 billion were still participating in TAG. 75% of banks with less than $10billion in assets were in the program. The higher participation rate by smaller banks may signal that they believed they needed the program to attract funds, whereas the larger banks were less likely to view it as necessary. Others may argue that decisions to participate in TAG may not have been driven by the actual usefulness of the program as much as by a possible stigma associated with participating in a program developed in response to the financial crisis. it is possible that since the end of 2010, both large and small banks may have changed their views on the value of the program. It is also possible that deposits may migrate away from those institutions due to regulatory changes made by the Dodd-Frank Act. Some market participants may view the steps taken by the DHS Act to be a threat to financial stability, the authors say. For example, the Act created a special resolution regime administered by the FDIC for failing firms that pose a threat of financial stability. remove TBTF status as credible and think they would recover even less of their uninsured deposits at a large firm than at a smaller or less interconnected institution. In that case, uninsured depositors may move their TAG deposits away from large institutions and use smaller banks. Depositors can effectively "deposit" their money in other nonbank options by buying shares in a money market fund (MMF), by buying U.S. Treasuries, or by choosing one of the many other available options. options, such as commercial paper, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities, repurchase agreements, enhanced cash funds, and municipal securities. Money market funds are mutual funds that invest in money market securities. They are short-term financial instruments with relatively high liquidities and short maturities of between several days and about a year. They're the second-most popular individual form of short- term investment according to a survey of financial professionals and will be the focus of this section of the article. Money market funds act as intermediaries between shareholders who demand liquid investments and borrowers who desire short-term funding. Money market funds attempt to keep a stable net asset value (NAV) on their shares, typically of $1.00. A stable NAV gives shareholders the impression of a high degree of safety similar to deposits but offering a higher return. If a money market fund falls below a $ 1.00 NAV, then the fund is said to "break the buck," and part of its value is lost. the fund's shareholders' invested principal is in jeopardy. Investors could actually lose money. Breaking the buck is a rare occurrence, though it happened in September 2008. In response, many withdrew their money from money market funds and deposited it in banks, as seen in Figure 5. If one of the reasons that money flowed to deposits was the presence of TAG, it is possible that the expiration of TAG could lead to a loss of money for investors.. Non-financial businesses have increased their. holdings of checkable deposits and decreased their holdings of money market. funds. Money market funds have traditionally earned a higher yield than bank deposits. Money market funds are currently earning historically low returns, lowering the opportunity cost of holding noninterest-bearing deposits. There is also uncertainty surrounding the future regulation of money market funds. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), a council of financial regulators that is charged with monitoring systemic risk in the financial system, has identified structural vulnerabilities in money market Funds. It is identified vulnerabilities in funds which could affect financial stability. The FSCO has identified vulnerabilities that could affect the financial stability of the United States. Some have raised concerns about what effect an extension of TAG would have on the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) Senator Harry Reid introduced a bill to temporarily extend the TAG program until December 31, 2014. The benefit of extending TAG, on the other hand, may be that it maintains confidence in the banking system and prevents future bank failures that would have required drawing on the DIF. The reduced market discipline caused by deposit insurance could incentivize banks to issue loans that do not accurately price the underlying risk.

Summary:
FPS assesses risk and recommends countermeasures to GSA and tenant agencies. Risk management is limited because resource allocation decisions are the responsibility of GSA. Security equipment that FPS recommends may not be implemented if tenant agencies are unwilling to fund it. FPS faces challenges in ensuring that its fee-based funding structure accounts for the varying levels of risk and types of services provided at federal facilities, the authors say. They say FPS’s basic security fee does not account for the risk faced by specific buildings, the level of service provided or the cost of providing services. FPS does not have a strategic human capital plan to guide its current and future workforce planning efforts. Instead, FPS has developed a short-term hiring plan that does not include key human capital principles, such as determining an agency’s optimum staffing needs. FPS has been transitioning to an inspector-based workforce, thus eliminating the police officer position and relying primarily on FPS inspectors for both law enforcement and physical security activities. In the absence of a strategichuman capital plan, it is difficult to discern how effective an inspector.-based workforce approach will be. example, FPS officials in some of the regions we visited said they implement their own procedures for managing their workforce. Additionally, FPS does not collect data on its workforce’s knowledge, skills, and abilities. These elements are necessary for successful workforce planning activities, such as identifying and filling skill gaps and succession planning. We recently recommended that FPS improve how it collects data to help it better manage and understand current and future workforce needs; and use these data in the development and implementation of a workforce plan. long-term strategic human capital plan that addresses key principles for effective strategic workforce planning. DHS concurred with our recommendations. FPS did not meet its fiscal year 2008 mandated deadline of increasing its staffing level to no fewer than 1,200 full-time employees by July 31, 2008, and instead met this staffing level in April 2009. FPS’s staff has steadily declined since 2004 and critical law enforcement services have been reduced or eliminated. For example, FPS has eliminated its use of proactive patrol to prevent or detect criminal violations at many GSA buildings. visited, not providing proactive patrol has limited its law enforcement personnel to a reactive force. FPS officials stated that in the past, proactive patrol permitted its police officers and inspectors to identify and apprehend individuals that were surveilling GSA buildings. In contrast, when FPS is not able to patrol federal buildings, there is increased potential for illegal entry and other criminal activity. In one city we visited, a deceased individual had been found in a vacant GSA facility that was not regularly patrolled by FPS. months. FPS does not fully ensure that its contract security guards have the training and certifications required to be deployed to a GSA building. FPS requires that all prospective guards complete about 128 hours of training including 8 hours of X-ray and magnetometer training. However, in one region, FPS has not provided the X-rays or magnetometers needed for this training. We have noted that the effectiveness of a risk management approach depends on the involvement of experienced and professional security personnel. Further, that the chances of omitting major steps in the risk management process increase if personnel are not well trained in applying risk management. magnetometer training to its 1,500 guards since 2004. X-ray training is critical because guards control access points at buildings. For example, at a level IV federal facility in a major metropolitan area, an infant in a carrier was sent through an X-rays machine due to a guard’s negligence. In that region, a woman with her infant in an infant carrier attempted to enter the building with the infant. She was stopped by a guard and the infant was sent back to the mother. The guard was not paying attention and the machine's safety features had been disabled. FPS investigated the incident and dismissed the guard. The guard subsequently sued FPS for not providing the required X-ray training. FPS could not produce any documentation to show that the guard had received the training, an FPS official said. In addition, FPS officials from the facility could not be reached for comment for this article. For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or see www.samaritans.org. that region could not tell us whether the X-ray machine’s safety features had been repaired. FPS does not have a fully reliable system for monitoring and verifying guard training and certification requirements. 62 percent of the guards had at least one expired certification, including a declaration that guards have not been convicted of domestic violence, which make them ineligible to carry firearms. Some guards were not provided building-specific training, such as what actions to take during a building evacuation or a building building fire. Lack of training may have contributed to several incidents where guards neglected their assigned responsibilities. At a level IV facility, the guards did not follow evacuation procedures and left two access points unattended, thereby leaving the facility vulnerable. FPS has limited assurance that its guards are complying with post-emergency procedures, according to the report. The report was published by the Center for Security Studies at the University of Florida. For confidential support, call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or see www.samaritans.org. FPS does not have specific national guidance on when and how guard inspections should be performed. Inspections of guard posts at GSA buildings are inconsistent and the quality varied in the six regions we examined. Guard inspections are typically completed by FPS during regular business hours and in locations where FPS has a field office, and seldom on nights or weekends. However, on an occasion when FPS officials conducted a post inspection at night, they found a guard asleep at his post after taking a pain-killer prescription drug. high-security facilities where guards neglected or inadequately performed their assigned responsibilities. For example, a guard failed to recognize or did not properly X-ray a box containing handguns at the loading dock at a facility. FPS became aware of the situation because the handguns were delivered to FPS. Because guards were not properly trained and did not comply with post orders, our investigators passed undetected through access points controlled by FPS guards at 10 of 10 level IV facilities in four major cities where GAO conducted covert tests. components for this device, items used to conceal the device components, and the methods of concealment that we used during our covert testing are classified. Of the 10 level IV facilities our investigators penetrated, 8 were government owned and 2 were leased facilities. The two leased facilities did not have any guards at the access control points at the time. The facilities included district offices of a U.S. Senator and aU.S Representative as well as agencies of Homeland Security, Transportation, Health and Human Services, Justice, State, and others. of our testing. Using publicly available information, our investigators identified a type of device that a terrorist could use to cause damage to a federal facility and threaten the safety of federal workers and the general public. The device was an IED made up of two parts—a liquid explosive and a low-yield detonator—and included a variety of materials not typically brought into aFederal facility by employees or the public. Although the detonator itself could function as a IED, investigators determined that it could also be used to set off a liquid explosive to cause significantly more damage. safety during this testing, we took precautions so that the IED would not explode. For example, we lowered the concentration level of the material. To gain entry into each of the 10 level IV facilities, our investigators showed a photo identification (a state driver’s license) and walked through the magnetometers without incident. Our investigators also placed their briefcases with theIED material on the conveyor belt of the X-ray machine, but the guards detected nothing. We did not receive any secondary searches from the guards that might have revealed the Ied material that they brought into the facilities. At security checkpoints at 3 of the 10 facilities, our investigators noticed that the guard was not looking at the X-ray screen as some of the IED components passed through the machine. A guard questioned an item in the briefcase at one of the10 facilities but the materials were subsequently allowed through theX-ray machines. At each facility, once past the guard screening checkpoint, our Investigators proceeded to a restroom and assembled the Ied. At some of those facilities, the restrooms were locked. Our investigators gained access by asking employees to let them in. in a briefcase, our investigators walked freely around several floors of the facilities and into various executive and legislative branch offices. Leveraging technology is a key practice over which FPS has somewhat more control. FPS does not have a comprehensive approach for identifying, acquiring, and assessing the cost-effectiveness of the security equipment that its inspectors recommend. Individual FPS inspectors have considerable latitude in determining which technologies and other countermeasures to recommend. But the inspectors receive little training and guidance in how to assess the relative cost- effectiveness of these technologies. FPS inspectors receive some training in identifying and recommending security technologies as part of their initial FPS physical security training. Since FPS was transferred to DHS in 2003, its refresher training program for inspectors has primarily focused on law enforcement. Consequently, inspectors lack recurring technology training. FPS does not provide inspectors with specialized guidance and standards for cost-effectively selecting technology. In the absence of specific guidance, inspectors follow the Department of Justice minimum countermeasure standards. For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or click here for details. FPS uses BSA executive summary to convey countermeasure recommendations to GSA. Document includes cost estimates but no analysis of alternatives. GSA and tenant agencies have limited assurance that investments in technologies are cost-effective, consistent across buildings, and best available alternatives. In 2006, FPS had had an explosives detection dog used to screen mail that is distributed elsewhere. For example, at one location we visited, an explosives Detection Dog was used to screens mail that was distributed elsewhere in the building. recommended, based on the results of its risk analysis, the use of this dog and an X-ray machine. The dog and handler work 12-hour shifts Monday through Friday when most mail is delivered and shipped. The GSA regional security officials we spoke with questioned whether this approach was more effective and efficient than using an on-site enhanced X-rays machine that could detect biological and chemical agents as well as explosives and could be used anytime. In accordance with the GSA's recommendation, the dog was being used at the time of our visit. FPS conducted a BSA of the site in 2008 and determined that using an enhanced X-ray machine and an explosives detection dog would bring the projected threat rating down from moderate to low. FPS included estimated one-time installation and recurring costs in the BSA and executive summary, but did not include the estimated cost and risk of the following mail screening options. Consequently, tenant agency representatives would have to investigate the possibility of using the dog only, according to the report. The report concluded that the use of the dog and the additional countermeasure would reduce the threat rating at the site. cost and risk implications of these options on their own to make an informed resource allocation decision. It is critical that FPS and GSA have well-established lines of communication with each other and with tenant agencies to ensure that all parties are aware of the ever- changing risks in a dynamic threat environment. FPS is the provider of law enforcement and related security services for GSA buildings. GSA is the manager of these properties and is responsible for security on the grounds of federal buildings in the U.S. levels are inconsistent, and overall, FPS and GSA disagree over what information should be shared. FPS is only required to meet formally with GSA property managers and tenant agencies as part of the BSA process. FPS had not been providing them consistently across all regions. GSA security officials said that these briefings mostly focused on crime statistics and did not constitute comprehensive threat analyses. FPS resumed the practice in October 2008, but GSA officials said it was not a comprehensive threat analysis. It is required to provide quarterly briefings at the regional level. We identified information sharing gaps at several level III and IV sites that we visited. In some cases these deficiencies led to decreased security awareness and increased risk. At one location, we observed during our interview with the BSC that the committee members were confused about procedures for screening visitors who are passengers in employees’ cars that enter the building via the parking garage. One of the tenants recounted an incident in which a security guard directed the visitor to walk through the garage to an appropriate screening. We found that in some cases this led to increased risk and decreased security. At one location, FPS had received inaccurate square footage data from GSA. The GSA property manager knew the appropriate screening procedure, but told us there was no written policy on the procedure that members could access. GSA officials at this location told us that they invite FPS to their property management meetings for that location, but FPS does not attend. The agency suggested that increased communication among the agencies would help them be more effective managers of their properties and provide tenants with better customer service.station. FPS, GSA, and tenant agency representatives did not all meet together regularly to make security preparations or manage security operations during construction. FPS officials told us they had not been invited to project meetings, although GSA officials said they had invited FPS and that FPS attended some meetings. In May 2008, FPS discovered that specific surveillance equipment had been removed. As of May 2009, FPS officials tell us they did not know who had removed the equipment and were working with tenant agency reps to recover it. that they believed FPS was fully aware that the equipment had been removed in December 2007. GSA tenant agencies had mixed views about some of the services they pay FPS to provide. On average about one-third of tenant agencies could not comment on how satisfied or dissatisfied they were with FPS’s level of communication of its services, partly because they had little to no interaction with FPS officers. Although FPS plans to remove the equipment, the agency says it has no immediate plans to replace it. 53 percent of e-mail addresses and 27 percent of the telephone numbers for designated points of contacts were missing from FPS’s contact database. Complete and accurate contact information is critical for information sharing and an essential component of any customer service initiative. FPS needs to improve its services to GSA and other tenant agencies to improve customer service to them and their clients. The agency is working with the GSA to improve the service it provides to tenant agencies and their tenants. The GSA is also working with FPS to improve service to its tenants. tenant agencies, we recommended that FPS collect and maintain an accurate and comprehensive list of all facility- designated points of contact. DHS concurred with our recommendations. FPS and GSA fundamentally disagree over how much of the information in the BSA should be, the report said. The report said the two organizations are partners in protecting and securing GSA buildings, but that they disagree on how much information should be included in the building's BSA. It said FPS should develop and implement a program for education and outreach to GSA and tenant agencies. shared. GSA security officials told us that FPS does not consistently share BSA executive summaries across all regions. Instead, GSA wants to receive BSAs in their entirety so that it can better protect GSA buildings and the tenants who occupy them. In a post-September 11th era, it is crucial that federal agencies work together to share information to advance homeland security and critical infrastructure protection efforts. The ability to share security-related information can unify the efforts of federal agencies in preventing or minimizing terrorist attacks. GAO: GSA is limited in its ability to assess the effectiveness of its efforts to protect GSA buildings. GAO: FPS does not have a reliable data management system that will allow it to accurately track these measures. Without this ability, FPS has difficulty determining whether it has mitigated the risk of GSA facilities to crime or a terrorist attack, GAO says.GAO recommends that GSA develop and implement specific guidelines and improve how it collects and analyzes data to help it better understand and protect its efforts. is unclear whether FPS will meet the implementation goals established in the program’s proposed timeline. Until RAMP components are fully implemented, FPS will continue to rely on its current risk assessment tool, methodology, and process. FPS does not have adequate controls to monitor and track whether its 11 regions are completing these new requirements. FPS is also taking steps to implement a more systematic approach to technology acquisition by developing a National Countermeasures Program, which could help FPS leverage technology more cost-effectively. the cost- effectiveness of alternative technologies into FPS’s planned improvements in the security acquisition area would represent an enhanced application of this key practice. We recently recommended that FPS develop a methodology and guidance for assessing and comparing the cost-effectiveness of technology alternatives, and DHS concurred with our recommendation. Another concern is that FPS had planned to implement the program throughout fiscal year 2009, but extended implementation into fiscal year 2010. Until the National Countermeasures Program is fully implemented, FPS will continue. FPS had anticipated that X-ray machine and magnetometer contracts would be awarded by December 2008. In May 2009, FPS officials told us that the X-rays machine contract was awarded on April 30, 2009. They anticipated awarding the magnetometer contract in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 and an electronic security services contract for surveillance and intrusion detection systems during the second quarter of 2010. We recently recommended that FPS not rely on individual inspectors to make technology decisions. We recommend that FPS stop relying on individual Inspectors to make tech decisions. that FPS provide the Secretary of Homeland Security with regular updates on the status of the National Countermeasures Program. DHS concurred with this recommendation and stated that FPS will submit a monthly report to the Secretary. Finally, as we stated at the outset, the protection of federal real property has been and continues to be a major concern. Therefore, we have used our key protection practices as criteria to evaluate the security efforts of other departments, agencies, and entities. For more information, visit www.fps.gov. The National Park Service does not manage risk servicewide. The Park Service has implemented a range of security program improvements in recent years that reflected some aspects of key practices. We have made recommendations to promote greater usage of key practice in ensuring the security of public spaces and of those who work at and visit them. For example, we have examined how DHS and the Smithsonian Institution secure their assets and identified challenges. Most recently, we evaluated the National Park service’s (Park Service) approach to national icon and park protection. or ensure the best return on security technology investments; (2) lacks a servicewide approach to sharing information internally and measuring performance; and (3) lacks clearly defined security roles and a security training curriculum. With millions of people visiting the nation’s nearly 400 park units annually, ensuring their security and the protection of our national treasures is paramount. More emphasis on the key practices would provide greater assurance that Park Service assets are well protected and that Park service resources are being used efficiently to improve protection. the government are facing. Our key practices provide a framework for assessing and improving protection practices. The Interagency Security Committee is using our key facility protection practices as key management practices to guide its priorities and work activities. For example, the committee established subcommittees for technology best practices and training, and working groups in the areas of performance measures and strategic human capital management. The committee also issued performance measurement guidance in 2009. Without greater attention to key protection practices, FPS will be ill equipped to efficiently and effectively fulfill its responsibilities of assessing risk, strategically managing. its workforce and contract guard program, recommending countermeasures, sharing information and coordinating with GSA and tenant agencies to secure GSA buildings. implementing our specific recommendations related to areas such as human capital and risk management will be critical steps in the right direction. Overall, following this framework would enhance FPS’s chances for future success and could position FPS to become a leader and benchmark agency for facility protection in the federal government.

Summary:
Calls to reform the UN began soon after its creation in 1945. Despite cycles of reform, UN member states continue to have concerns about inefficient management operations. The United States, through the Department of State in Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Mission to the United Nations in New York, continues to advocate reform of UN management processes. In July 1997, the Secretary-General proposed a broad reform agenda to transform the UN. The UN is the largest contributor of 192 member states. In May 2000, we reported that while the Secretary-General had substantially reorganized the Secretariat’s leadership and structure, he had not yet completed reforms in human resource management and planning and budgeting. In September 2002, to encourage the full implementation of the 1997 reforms, he released a second set of reform initiatives, some expanding on those introduced in 1997 and others reflecting new priorities. In February 2004, we. reported that 60 percent of the 88 reform initiatives in the 1997 agenda and 38 percent of. the 66 initiatives in the 2002 agenda were in place. In 2004 and 2005, a series of UN and expert task force reports recommended a comprehensive reform of UN management and the UN human rights apparatus. In September 2005, world leaders gathered at the UN World Summit in New York to discuss global issues such as UN reform, development, and human rights. The outcome document from the World Summit, endorsed by all members of the UN, outlines broad UN reform efforts in areas such as oversight and accountability. In April 2006, we reported on weaknesses in the UN’s oversight and procurement systems. The document also called for the Secretary-General to submit proposals for implementing reforms to improve management functions of the Secretariat. We found that UN funding arrangements constrained the ability of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) to operate independently and direct resources toward high-risk areas as needed. In addition, we found serious weaknesses in procurement internal controls. Specifically, the UN lacked an effective organizational structure for managing procurement. In October 2006, we reported slow progress in five key UN management reform areas. Numerous reform proposals were either awaiting General Assembly review or had been recently approved. Many of the proposed or approved reforms lacked an implementation plan with time frames and cost estimates for the goals stated in the 2005 outcome document. We also identified several factors that could affect the UN’s ability to fully implement the goals of its reform programs. The UN had not adopted specific ethics guidance. It had not made a commitment to improving its procurement workforce. The UN has taken steps to improve organizational ethics since the fall of 2006. In the past year, the ethics office has hired a permanent director and additional staff and has developed and provided ethics standards, training, and guidance. The office has begun to enforce a whistleblower protection policy, but concerns have been raised about the policy’s lack of jurisdiction over UN funds and programs. The UN ethics office had made some progress in developing and circulating ethics standards and guidance and had begun to develop a systemwide code of ethics. The UN has made substantial progress in enforcing a whistleblower protection policy. The ethics office has begun receiving complaints of retaliation, and several concerns have arisen during the handling of cases. Between August 1, 2006, and July 31, 2007, the ethics office received 52 complaints of whistleblower retaliation. The office was copied on six complaints that were primarily addressed to other offices or departments in the UN. In these instances, the office keeps track of and follows up on any pending action by other offices. UN and State officials have raised concerns regarding the UN’s whistleblower protection Policy. The success of the UN’s whistleblower protection policy could be, in part, dependent on successful reform of the internal justice system. Some UN staff members might not trust the current system to be fair or impartial and, consequently, might not come forward with claims of retaliation. In its August 2007 annual activities report, the ethics office expressed a concern that it had not had an opportunity to provide input into its role in the proposed new internal Justice system. The Government Accountability Project is a non-profit public interest group. UN and State officials told us another concern about the whistleblower protection policy is its lack of jurisdiction over UN funds and programs. In August 2007, after initially reviewing a whistleblower retaliation case of an employee at the UN Development Program, the ethics office and the Office of Legal and Procurement Services concluded that the UN’s whistleblower Protection policy applies only to employees directly under the Secretary-General. The Government Accountability Project has criticized the effectiveness of the current UN whistleblower protectionpolicy. In his August 2007 report on the activities of the ethics. office, the secretary-general recommended that the General Assembly consider broadening. the scope of the office. The UN has made some progress in collecting and analyzing financial disclosure forms for 2005 and 2006. Financial disclosure forms have been collected from UN staff members, and a private contractor has begun to review them. The primary purpose of the financial disclosure program is to identify potential conflicts of interest arising from staff members’ financial holdings, private affiliations, or outside activities. About 1,700 staff members were required to file financial disclosure or about 1,200 were asked to provide information on their personal finances. declaration of interest statements for 2005. About 98 percent of staff complied, and the remaining 2 percent were referred to the Office of Human Resources Management for disciplinary action. A total of 2,548 staff members were required to file forms for 2006. The office reported that the increase in staff required to filing likely reflects an increased awareness of the program by the heads of departments and their staff members. In addition, as a confidence-building measure, the current UN Secretary-General and Deputy Secretary- General voluntarily made their recent financial disclosure forms public. a private contractor and analyzed to determine any potential conflicts of interest between the staff members’ confidentially disclosed private interests and their official duties and responsibilities. In May 2007, the contractor identified potential conflicts. of interest in 17 of the cases reviewed, or about 1 percent. Of these cases, 14 staff members accepted the advice of the private contractor to address the potential conflict and 3 cases were referred to the ethics office for final resolution. The 2006 review is not yet complete. The deadline for submitting forms for 2006 was delayed until May. A private contractor developed an online e-filing system in liaison with the ethics office to simplify and expedite filing requirements. The ethics office plans to review the online financial disclosure form and accompanying guidelines in consultation with other UN offices to decide whether modifications need to be made. The process for the 2006 review was ongoing, and, as a result, the compliance rate was not finalized as of September 2007, according to the UN ethics office. The online financial Disclosure Form is available online at www.un.org.uk.  Steps have been taken to improve UN oversight capabilities. Member states established an Independent Audit Advisory Committee (IAAC) in June 2007. The committee is not expected to be operational until January 2008. UN funding arrangements continue to constrain OIOS’s ability to audit high-risk areas. The General Assembly has not authorized OIos’S financial and operational independence. In June 2007, member states established IAAC to provide an external, independent assessment ofUN oversight capabilities based on best practices in the private sector as well as the experiences of other international institutions. 5 individuals, preferably from a pool of at least 10 candidates proposed by member states, based on regional and geographical representation and selected by the General Assembly. The guidelines and requirements represent a compromise among the member states. Member states disagreed on some of the initially proposed responsibilities of IAAC. The five members of the newly created IAAC were elected in November 2007, and the committee is expected to be operational in January 2008. OIOS has made progress in reducing its range of functions and improving the capacity of its evaluations and inspections sections. been made in strengthening the procedures for its procurement staff and suppliers, developing a comprehensive training program for procurement staff, and developing a risk management framework. However, the UN has made little or no progress in establishing an independent bid protest system and creating a lead agency concept for procurements. In addition, since our October 2006 report, other organizational issues have arisen that may affect the UN’s procurement reform efforts. Progress on UN procurement reform is shown in the UN's procurement reform report from October 2006. The UN Secretariat has made some progress in strengthening the operating procedures for its procurement staff and suppliers. In December 2006, the Secretariat issued a bulletin on postemployment restrictions for former UN staff involved in procurement. The bulletin was issued following several incidents in recent years in which UN officials and former officials were involved in unethical and improper procurement activities. Former UN staff members, for 1 year following UN employment, are prohibited from accepting employment or compensation from any UN contractor. For 2 years, they are prohibited to act on behalf of UN contractors. A proposal to increase the minimum threshold for contracts required to be reviewed by the Headquarters Committee on Contracts from $200,000 to $500,000 has not been approved. The UN also issued, in May 2007, a revised supplier code of conduct. The code requires that suppliers are responsible for adhering to the postemployment restrictions by not employing former UN staff members for at least 1 year following a staff member’s separation from the UN. OIOS previously recommended that the threshold be increased, and, according to Procurement. The UN Procurement Division has made some progress in developing a comprehensive training program. The program is not expected to be formally in place until early 2008. The training is part of a development plan to provide a career path for procurement staff. Those who complete the training will be eligible to be certified by internationally recognized procurement institutions. In addition, according to UN procurement officials, all procurement staff will be trained in contracting, acquisition, and other specialized subjects. It is expected that the training program will be completed by the end of the year. The UN expects to have provided the training to all field staff by the end of March 2008. The UN Procurement Division has made some progress in its efforts to develop a risk management framework. In July 2007, a Planning, Compliance, and Monitoring Section was established and a chief was appointed to establish tools to detect potential transaction problems and minimize risks. Also, a proposal for implementing the concept of best-value-for-money is under development.

The UN Department of Management is in the initial planning stages of establishing a UN-wide risk management framework. As of September 2007, the concept is still in the planning stages, time frames and costs for its implementation have not been established, and risks associated with procurement activities remain. For example, the OIOS Procurement Task Force reported in October 2007 that it had found multiple instances of fraud, waste, and mismanagement—including 10 instances of Fraud and Corruption. The concept is expected to be put into practice by theprocurement Division in March 2008. in cases with an aggregate value of over $610 million—resulting in misappropriation of resources or the unjust enrichment of vendors and their agents in excess of $25 million. The task force reported that a number of cases have been referred to national authorities for criminal prosecution or to the UN for consideration of subsequent legal action. It has also recommended civil recovery of monetary damages. As of October 2007, an independent bid protest system had not been established. The lack of an independentbid protest system limits the transparency of the procurement process. vendor to protest the outcome of a contract decision to an independent official or office. Such a system would provide reasonable assurance that vendors are treated fairly when bidding. The draft process, which includes an emphasis on best practices from public- and private-sector procurements, is expected to be finalized by the first quarter of 2008. Officials told us that, in the meantime, they have enhanced communications with vendors, including developing a more systematic debriefing procedure for vendors. The UN Procurement Division is based in Geneva, Switzerland. whose bids were unsuccessful. The UN has made little or no progress in establishing a lead agency concept. For example, the World Food Program might be best suited to procure items for air transport needs. In a report on procurement reform submitted to the General Assembly in June 2006, the UN projected that implementation of the lead agencies concept would take 6 to 12 years. The World Food Programme is the world's largest food producer, followed by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the UN World Health Organization. The U.N. Inter-Agency Procurement Services Office is best at procuring vehicles. months. In December 2006, the General Assembly did not approve a proposal to adopt the concept. Issues that are currently unclear include operational procedures, such as establishing lines of communication. The General Assembly didn't consider several procurement reform issues during the recently completed 61st session because of the UN’s June 2007 reorganization of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO), the Procurement Division said. In the absence of the General assembly’S approval, Procurements officials told us they have established informal relationships with several UN organizations. The UN has taken actions to improve some of the management operations of the Secretariat. The reorganization of the DPKO created several procurement-related concerns that have not yet been addressed. Many reform proposals still have not moved forward. Some progress has been made in some areas, but more needs to be done in other areas, the UN says. The UN has also taken steps to improve the efficiency of its procurement system. The U.N. Secretary-General has called for a review of the U.S. government's procurement practices. Since our October 2006 report, the UN Secretariat has issued several reports on management operations. Little or no progress has been made in reforming the UN’s internal justice system, reforming certain budgetary and financial management functions, and improving the delivery of certain services. The General Assembly is expected to consider these issues during the current (62nd) session. The UN has made some progress in improving human resource functions, while little progress on reforming the financial management of the Secretariat is shown in figure 4. The UN has issued several reports with proposals that, if implemented, could improve some human resource functions. The proposals are, in large part, still awaiting General Assembly review. The UN has made some progress in improving information technology. The Secretariat plans to present reports to the General Assembly during the 62nd session, on topics such as the governance of information technology and the internal justice system, the report says. The report concludes that effective reform of the UN is not possible without an efficient, well-resourced and independent, independent justice system that safeguards the rights of staff.
