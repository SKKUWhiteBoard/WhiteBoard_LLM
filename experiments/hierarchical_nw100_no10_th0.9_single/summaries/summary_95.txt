The key objectives of U.S. public diplomacy are to engage, inform, and influence overseas audiences. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, State has expanded its public diplomacy efforts globally. The BBG manages and oversees the Voice of America (VOA), Radio/TV Marti, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and the Alhurra TV Network. As shown in figure 1, State and the BBG spent close to $1.5 billion on public diplomacy programs in fiscal year 2006.
