Part 3 in our series on distributed word representations. We're going to be talking about vector comparison methods. To try to make this discussion pretty intuitive, I'm going to ground things in this running example. On the left, I have a very small vector space model. We have three words, A, B, and C. And you can see graphically that B and C are pretty close together. And A is kind of lonely down here in the corner, the infrequent one. we changed the space as I showed you before. So they're all up here kind of on the units here. And notice that the actual values that we get out are the same whether or not we did that L2 norming step. And that is because cosine is building the effects of L2norming directly into this normalization here in the denominator. There are a few other methods that we could think about or classes of methods. I think we don't need to get distracted by the details.
