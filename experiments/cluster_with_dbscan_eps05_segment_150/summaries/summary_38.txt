So I think I just spend like five minutes, just briefly review on the backpropagation last time. So I didn't have time to explain this figure, which I think probably would be useful as a high level summary of what's happening. Like this is the forward path. This is how you define network and the loss function. So you start with some example x, and then you have some-- I guess, this is a matrix vector multiplication module, and you take x inner product multiplied with w and b. And then get some activation, the pre-activation. And you get some post activation. going to discuss this more next time. So the high level thing is just that something else is driving the norm to be small. Thanks. Going to talk more about this in the next few days.

And what I mean by that is that even within linear models, you can try to change the model complexity. So what that means is that you just insist that you always use linear model. But what you change is to decide how many features you use. So you can start with only using one feature or two features like for example, in the house price, where you can use the square foot as the single feature, or you can collect a bunch of other features. That means you have more going to discuss this more next time.
