In order to be successful whenever you're drawing blood or starting IVs you really have to know a couple things number one you need to know the name of the vein that you're going to use and its location along with what can that vein actually handle. Some veins can only handle about a 20 or a 22 gauge IV cannula versus some of them can handle 18 gages 16 gages. I also like to use accessories cephalic vein along with the median vein of the forearm and of course those hand mains the dorsal venous network.
