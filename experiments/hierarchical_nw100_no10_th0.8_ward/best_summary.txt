Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) are a tool developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and used by various federal agencies. DOE has acknowledged that TRLs can play a key role in assessing the maturity of technologies during the contracting process. Other agencies similarly charged with developing technologies, such as NASA and the Department of Defense (DOD), use TRL's to characterize technologies. The agency recently issued a Technology Readiness Assessment Guide, which lays out three key steps to conducting technology readiness assessments. Using TRLs we developed for these technologies, we found consensus among stakeholders that CCS is less mature than efficiency technologies. We found that the Office of Fossil Energy does not use a standard set of benchmarks or terms to describe or report on the maturity of technologies. DOE’s goals for advancing these technologies sometimes use terms that are not well defined. The lack of such benchmarks or an assessment of the maturity. of key coal technologies and whether they are achieving planned or desired results limits. the Guide is not mandatory, but DOE’s Office of Environmental Management uses the Guide as part of managing its procurement activities. The National Nuclear Security Administration has used TRLs recently as well. In the absence of an assessment from DOE, we asked stakeholders to gauge the maturity of coal technologies using a scale we developed based onTRLs. Table 2 shows the TRls we developed for coal technologies by adapting the NASA and used by various federal agencies to rate the extent to which technologies have been demonstrated to work. for review and comment. In addition, we provided selected slides on reliability of electricity supply to NERC for comment. We received written comments from DOE’s Assistant Secretary of the Office of Fossil Energy, which are reproduced in appendix III. The Assistant Secretary concurred with our recommendation, stating that DOE could improve its process for providing a clearer picture of technology maturity. He also said DOE planned to conduct a formal TRL assessment of coal technologies in the near future. We have incorporated technical comments, which we have incorporated as appropriate. Many technologies to improve plant efficiency have been used and are available for commercial use now, but still face challenges. injection wells can be permitted as Class I (injections of hazardous wastes, industrial nonhazardous wastes, municipal wastewater) or Class V wells. According to EPA, once site site closure of the well is approved, well operators will only be liable under the SDWA if they violate or fail to comply with EPA orders. EPA plans to finalize the geologic sequestration rule in fall 2010. Neither the proposed rule nor the final rule will address liability for unintended releases of stored CO emissions. GAO conducted initial scoping interviews with power plant operators, technology vendors, and federal officials from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and DOE. We selected a group of 19 stakeholders with expertise in carbon capture and storage (CCS) or technologies to improve coal plant efficiency. This group of stakeholders included representatives from major operated. national laboratories, the National Academy of Sciences, International Energy Agency (IEA), Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Global CCS Institute. We also reviewed available data on the use of key coal technologies compiled by IEA and the Global C CS Institute. May 2010, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We selected this nonprobability sample of states because they contained projects involving advanced coal technologies. To conduct this work, we reviewed key reports including those from the Department of Energy’s (DOE) national laboratories, the National Academy of Sciences, International Energy Agency, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The report will be available at no charge on the GAO’s Web site at http://www.gao.gov. EPA and NERC provided technical comments, which we have incorporated as appropriate. Unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date.

GAO conducted this performance audit from July 2009 through May 2010, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We interviewed senior DOE staff on these Visited coal power plants and research facilities in three selected states—AL, MD, and WV4. all U.S. emissions of COCO2 is the most prevalent greenhouse gas (GHG) program and interviewed seniorDOE staff on the plants and facilities in these states. We conducted the audit in compliance with GAO standards. Review (NSR) requirements could raise electricity costs, increase demand for water, and could affect the ability of individual plants to operate reliably. IEA estimated that CCS technologies could meet 20 percent of reductions needed to reduce global CO. Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers called CCS the “critical enabling technology” to reduce CO emissions while allowing continued use of coal in the future. We provided a draft of our report to the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of EPA for review and comment. TRLs we developed for coal technologies by adapting the NASA TRLs. for EOR use. Commercial deployment of CCS within 10 to 15 years is possible according to DOE and other stakeholders. But this is contingent on overcoming a variety of economic, technical, and legal challenges. plants have already been demonstrated commercially. For example, ultrasupercritical plants ranging from 600 to more than 1,000 MW have been built or are under construction in Europe and Asia. There are five IGCC plants in operation around the world, including two in the United States. lieu of more efficient coal plants. Some higher efficiency plant designs also face technical challenges in that they require more advanced materials than are currently available. From a legal perspective, most stakeholders reported that making efficiency upgrades to the existing fleet of coal power plants was limited by the prospect of triggering the Clean Air Act’s New Source Review (NSR) requirements. For example, “advanced” ultrasupercritical plants require development of metal alloys to withstand steam temperatures that could be 300 to 500 degrees Fahrenheit higher. In the next decade, the electricity sector could move more towards using natural gas to meet emissions targets. Most stakeholders told us that CCS would increase electricity prices. MIT estimated that plants with post-combustion capture have 61 percent higher cost of electricity. IGCC plants with pre- Combustion Capture (CCS) have a 27% higher cost compared to plants without these technologies, according to DOE. Some utility officials said CCS could lead to a decline in the ability of individual plants to operate reliably because a power plant might need more water. a commercial scale plant. We defined a commercial scale power plant as 500 megawatts (MW) and emitting about 3 millions tons of carbon dioxide (CO) annually. We based this definition on some of the key reports we reviewed, which used 500 MW as a standard power plant. Such a plant would emit about 3 million tons of CO emissions from a power plant can vary based on a variety of factors, including the amount of time that a power Plant is operated. We also reviewed available data on the use of
