SOCOM was the first combatant command endowed with acquisition authority and its own budget line. SOCOM has an Acquisition Executive who has the authority to negotiate memoranda of agreement with the military departments. The military services are responsible for funding certain types of SOCOM training, service-common equipment, and professional services. The SOCOM Commander is directly responsible for all portions of the command and the Acquisition Executive (AE) reports directly to the Commander. This direct chain of command allows for rapid communication on purpose, intent, and decisionmaking.
