ROTC is the largest of the three major officer commissioning programs for DOD. ROTC programs prepare college and university students to serve as officers in the military services. Most states have a unit from each service located within the state and all states have at least one unit located in the state. The military services typically operate ROTT programs using a 5-year production cycle, beginning the year prior to school entry and culminating in the graduation year. The servicesâ€™ headquarters determine the number of newly commissioned officers needed annually.
