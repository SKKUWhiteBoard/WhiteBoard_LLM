In 1995, over 9,000 foreign physicians with J-1 visas were in the United States for graduate medical education or training. The number of waivers being processed for physicians to practice in underserved areas each year has grown from 70 in 1990, to 1,374 in 1995. Waiver physicians are practicing in virtually every state; most are primary care physicians. Indications are that in 1995, about half of the foreign physicians that were supposed to return home were granted waivers of this requirement.

Bureau of Reclamation's Friant Dam on the San Joaquin River became fully operational in the 1940s. As a result, approximately 60 miles of the river is dry in most years, making it impossible to support Chinook salmon populations. A U.S. District Court judge has since ruled that operation ofFriant Dam violates state law. Parties agreed to negotiate a settlement instead of proceeding to trial on a remedy regarding the court's ruling.. Full implementation of the Settlement would require congressional authorization and appropriations. If Congress does not act on the legislation, some fear that the court will order a remedy that may differ from the Settlement.

Commercialization of air navigation services was intended to relieve the government of a fiscal responsibility. According to ICAO, the government should still regulate the safety of the ANSP’s operations. The ANSP should be encouraged to be as competitive, efficient, and cost-effective as any other commercial business. The five commercialized ANSPs are affiliated with one or more international aviation-related organizations. All five ANSPS are also members of the Civil Air Navigation Services Organization (CANSO)

Offshoring, also known as offshore outsourcing, has been taking place for decades. The extension of offshoring from U.S. manufacturers to service providers has heightened public policy concerns. Offshoring is contributing to the slow rebound of the labor market from the 2007-2009 recession. Some economists agree that it benefits the nation as a whole by enabling firms to sell a greater variety of higher quality products to U.s. consumers at lower prices. But some question whether this scenario applies to services offsh outsourcing.

The 1986 amendments to RCRA established the LUST Trust Fund to finance the cleanup of petroleum releases from underground storage tanks. Until recently, states could use these funds only for cleanup and related administrative and enforcement activities. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the 2005 Act), enacted in August 2005, expanded the permitted uses of the Lust Trust Fund. EPA will undertake a cleanup only when there is a major public health or environmental emergency, and no responsible party is able or willing to provide an adequate and timely response.

Congress and the Executive Office of the President have directed federal agencies to address the potential impacts of climate change. Climate change has the potential to affect many aspects of the environment and society in which water resource management plays an active role. Climate-related changes are expected to continue and increase in intensity in some areas of the nation. Adaptation is a risk-management strategy to protect vulnerable sectors and communities that might be affected by climate change, the authors say. The options for responding to climate change will likely require a partnership between federal, state, and local interests, they say.

It would also proscribe conditions under which an asylum seeker who was a victim of terrorist coercion would not be excluded as a terrorist. The U.S. has long held to the principle that it will not return a foreign national to a country where his life or freedom would be threatened. The law states other conditions for mandatory denials of asylum claims, including when the alien has been convicted of a serious crime.

Summary:
USDA’s CBAs provide services such as farm loans and conservation assistance. Under the E- File Act, these agencies were required to establish an electronic filing and retrieval system enabling farmers and other agricultural producers to access departmental forms via the Internet. By December 1, 2000, USDA was to submit to Congress a plan for enabling producers to obtain forms and information, such as crop insurance applications and production and yield reports, over the Web. By June 20, 2002, agricultural producers be further mandated to file paperwork electronically with USDA if they choose to do so.

Summary:
User financing is one approach to financing federal programs or activities. Some excise taxes, however, can also be described as a form of user financing. The inspection fees vary in the way they are set, collected, used, and reviewed. The fees can only recoup authorized program costs to the extent that total reimbursable program costs do not exceed the rate caps prescribed in statute. The AQI fee statute grants the Secretary of Agriculture broad discretion to prescribe and collect fees sufficient to cover the cost of providing agricultural quarantine and inspection services.

Summary:
USDA, FDA, EPA, and NMFS are involved in key program functions related to food safety. In fiscal year 2003, the four federal agencies spent nearly $1.7 billion on food safety-related activities. USDA and FDA are responsible for most federal food safety resources. The agencies’ expenditures vary by program function (as shown in fig. 3). For example, USDA’s inspection/enforcement expenditures made up almost three-quarters of the total spent by these agencies for that program function.

Federal agencies rely on computerized information systems to process, maintain, and report large volumes of sensitive data. Ineffective protection of these systems and information can impair delivery of vital services and result in loss or theft of computer resources, assets, and funds. IRS employs about 90,000 people in its Washington, D.C., headquarters and at more than 550 offices in all 50 states, U.S. territories, and some embassies and consulates. During fiscal year 2015, IRS collected more than $3.3 trillion; processed more than 243 million tax returns and other forms.

Summary:
Most discussions of Russian interests in Iraq focus on economic factors. Moscow has cultivated friendly relations with Baghdad since the 1960s. Russian oil companies have contracts that could be worth as much as $30 billion over 20 years to develop Iraqi oil fields. Russian firms have contractsworth billions to helpmodernize Iraq's economic infrastructure. Russia profits greatly from high oil prices. But Russian leaders fear that a post-Saddam Iraq mightmaximize its oil output, dramatically driving down the price of oil. Russian policy is also motivated by a desire to restrain U.S. global domination.

Summary:
The focus of patent examination is to determine whether the invention in a patent application satisfies the legal requirements for a patent. As of May 2015, USPTO had nearly 8,300 patent examiners across the eight technology centers we reviewed. Examiners are expected to complete their examination of an application in a certain number of hours. The allotted time includes the time needed to review the application, perform a search for prior art, and complete all office actions. For example, an examiner reviewing an application related to wire fabrics and structure may be allotted about 14 hours for examination.

Summary:
Prepositioned equipment and supplies are strategic assets, along with sealift and airlift, for projecting military power. These assets include combat equipment, spare parts, and sustainment supplies that are stored on ships and on land in locations around the world. Military equipment and infrastructure are often located in corrosive environments that increase the deterioration of assets and shorten their useful life. Higher rates of corrosion result in increased repairs and replacements, drive up costs, and take critical systems out of action, reducing mission readiness.

Summary:
Congress has enacted several laws to assist agencies and the federal government in managing IT investments. About 8.5 percent of federal agencies’ planned spending for fiscal year 2016 has gone toward provisioned IT services, leaving the vast majority of spending going toward IT that is non-provisioned. The federal government has spent billions of dollars on failed and poorly performing IT investments which often suffered from ineffective management, such as project planning, requirements definition, and program oversight and governance. In the last 6 years, we made approximately 800 recommendations to agencies to improve the transparency and oversight of underperforming IT investments and manage more effectively.

Census data remain an important element in allocating federal aid to state and local governments. Accurate census results are critical because the data are used to reapportion seats in the House of Representatives and for congressional redistricting. To help ensure the accuracy of census data, the bureau conducted a number of quality assurance programs. The Full Count Review program was designed to rapidly examine, rectify if possible, and clear census data files and products for subsequent processing or public release. It ran from June 2000 through March 2001.

An ISP’s traffic connects to a backbone Internet backbone networks. Unlike telecommunications services, the provision of Internet backbone service is not regulated. Two types of facilities are used for the exchange of data traffic by interconnected Internet backbone providers. Backbone providers have points of presence in varied locations, although they concentrate these facilities in more densely-populated areas where Internet end users’ demands for access are greatest. In a “peering” relationship, backbone providers exchange traffic destined for each other without the imposition of a fee.

In January 2003, we designated implementation and transformation of the new Department of Homeland Security as high risk. One of the department’s key challenges is integrating the components’ respective financial management systems, many of which were outdated and had limited functionality, as well as addressing weaknesses from the inherited components. Failure to effectively carry out its mission would potentially expose the nation to very serious consequences, the report says. The report says that without sound internal control and accurate and timely financial information, it is not possible to accomplish the agenda and secure the best performance.

FBI shares responsibility with the Coast Guard for preventing and responding to terrorist incidents in the maritime environment. Terrorists have attempted and carried out attacks on energy tankers since September 11, 2001, authors say. They say piracy threatens transiting one of the world's busiest shipping lanes through the Suez Canal.

In September 2008, ongoing financial turmoil escalated into a financial panic. Large financial institutions, such as Lehman Brothers and AIG, were failing. In spite of a loss of confidence in other parts of the financial system, the insured banking sector saw few bank runs. Extending deposit and the moral hazard created by deposit insurance may have strengthened the banking system by discouraging some borrowers from withdrawing their deposits during the height of financial stress. The TAG program provides unlimited deposit insurance for $1.4 trillion in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts (NIBTAs)

Summary:
FPS assesses risk and recommends countermeasures to GSA and tenant agencies. But FPS’s ability to influence the allocation of resources using risk management is limited. Security equipment that FPS recommends may not be implemented if tenant agencies are unwilling to fund it. FPS takes a building-by-building approach to risk management, using an outdated risk assessment tool to create building security assessments (BSA) The current approach provides less assurance that the most critical risks at federal buildings are being prioritized and mitigated.

In July 1997, the Secretary-General proposed a broad reform agenda to transform the UN. The United States, through the Department of State in Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Mission to the United Nations in New York, continues to advocate reform of UN management processes. In October 2006, we reported slow progress in five key UN management reform areas. In the past year, the ethics office has hired a permanent director and additional staff. The office has begun to enforce a whistleblower protection policy, but concerns have been raised about the policy’s jurisdiction.
