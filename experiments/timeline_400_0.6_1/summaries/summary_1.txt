John ESSIGMANN: I measure my blood sugar at different times during the day. Gluconeogenesis technically means new synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors. The medicine I take is called Metformin. It has a number of targets, but one of them is one of the enzymes, called PEPCK, Pyruvate Carboxykinase, that's in the gluconeogenic pathway. The liver provides a constant stream of glucose to these organs that absolutely require it, like our brain. the night, is to take this drug that will prevent the switch to produce more and more sugar by gluconeogenesis. The drug will stop the switch from producing more sugar to producing less sugar. It will also prevent the production of more sugar from the body's own production of sugar. This is called the 'gluconeogenesis inhibitor' and is used in the treatment of diabetes and obesity. It is a drug that stops the switch between the two processes from occurring. It also prevents the body from producing too much sugar.
