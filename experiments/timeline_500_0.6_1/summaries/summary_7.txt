as a nurse you want to be familiar with heart blocks and in this review i'm going to be talking about third degree heart blocks also known as a complete heart block. This type of heart block is the worst of all blocks and the reason is occurring is because electrical signal from the atria isn't making it to the ventricles. The person could be born with it so it could be congenital or the person has severe heart disease or they have a myocardial infarction or they're taking some type of medication. could progress to death so what you want to do is activate that emergency response system and this will get a team in the room to help you now some treatment that can be given to that patient is that atropine can be administered to help that heart pump more efficiently or the patient could be connected to a temporary pacemaker which will again get that heart beating correctly so we can maintain cardiac output. Eventually the patient will need a permanent pacemaker implanted okay so that wraps up this review over third degree heart block.
