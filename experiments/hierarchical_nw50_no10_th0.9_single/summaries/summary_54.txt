DOD relies on a complex array of computer-dependent and mutually supportive organizational components. Performance requirements for weapon systems have become increasingly demanding. Software code that is poorly developed or purposely injected with malicious code could be used to disrupt these and other DOD information systems, and potentially others connected to the DOD systems. U.S. defense industry is at the forefront of advanced design and development of weapon systems that include militarily critical technologies, access to these technologies is sought after for industrial and financial purposes.
