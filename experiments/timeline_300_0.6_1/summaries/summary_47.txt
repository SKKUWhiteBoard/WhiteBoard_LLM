Political philosophy is the oldest of the social sciences. It can boast a wealth of heavy hitters from Plato and Aristotle to Machiavelli, Hobbes, Hegel, Tocqueville, Nietzsche. The study of the great books or great thinkers of the past can easily degenerate into a kind of antiquarianism, into a sort of pedantry, says Professor Steven Smith. But these works provide us with the most basic questions that continue to guide our field, he says. "The ideas of John Maynard Keynes, both economists and political philosophers, when they are right, are more powerful than is commonly understood," says Smith. Fierce loyalty, partisanship: it is inseparable from the character of regime politics. Henry Adams once cynically reflected that politics is simply the "organization of hatreds" This raises the question whether it is possible to transform politics, to replace enmity and factional conflict with friendship, he says. Is such a thing possible? It can't be ruled out, but such a world administered by international courts of law, by judges and judicial tribunals, would no longer be a political world. The study of regime politics is in part a study of the distinctive national character types that constitutes a citizen body. This raises a further set of questions that we will consider over the term. How are regimes founded, the founding of regimes? What brings them into being and sustains them over time? For thinkers like Tocqueville, for example, regimes are embedded in the deep structures of human history that have determined over long centuries the shape of our political institutions and the way we think about them. see you back, and have a very good but thoughtful September 11^(th).
