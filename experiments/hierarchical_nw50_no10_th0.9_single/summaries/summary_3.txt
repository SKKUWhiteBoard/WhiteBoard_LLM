TPPs prepare teaching candidates to employ effective teaching techniques and gain real-world experience in the classroom. The structure of TPPs can vary widely, from “traditional” TPPs such as four-year undergraduate programs with student teaching requirements. States are also responsible for adopting academic content standards for K-12 students. To address concerns about inadequately prepared students, all states are now using or developing academic standards that are explicitly tied to college and career preparation (referred to in this report as new K- 12 standards)
