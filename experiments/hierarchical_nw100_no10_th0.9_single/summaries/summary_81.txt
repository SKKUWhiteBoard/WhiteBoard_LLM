Since 1872, hardrock mining on federal lands has been governed by the General Mining Law. The law allows virtually free access to open public domain lands for mineral prospecting, staking claims, exploration and development, and extraction without payment of a royalty. Congress has repeatedly considered, but not passed, reform of the Mining Law, including, in part, to require the payment of royalties. This report analyzes proposals to impose a royalty on hardrock (locatable minerals) minerals on federal domain lands. It also discusses the federal tax treatment of the hardrock mineral industry.
