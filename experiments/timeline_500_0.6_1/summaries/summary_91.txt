Aristotle was born 384,15 years after the trial of Socrates. He was sent by his father to go to college. Unlike most of you, Aristotle did not spend four years at the Platonic Academy. He remained attached to it for the next 20, until the death of Plato. Unlike his intellectual godfather, Socrates, who wrote nothing but conversed endlessly, Aristotle wrote disciplined and thematic treatises on virtually every topic. He collected constitutions, 158 of them in all, from throughout the ancient world. Aristotle says man is, by nature, the political animal. He says participation in the life of the city is necessary for the achievement of human excellence. A person who is without a city, he says, who is apolis--without a city--must either be a beast or a god. The city is natural in that it allows human beings to achieve and perfect what he calls their telos, that is to say their end, their purpose. But there is a second sense for him, in some ways, in which he says the polis is by nature.
