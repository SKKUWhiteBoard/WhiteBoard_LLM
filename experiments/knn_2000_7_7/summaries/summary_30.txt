Bentham's principle is "the greatest happiness of the greatest number" He thinks all utility is quantifiable and expressible through money. He also has a doctrine of revealed preference, where we can vary the price to get information about your utility. Bentham allows interpersonal comparisons of utility, so we can say that if you take one unit of utility from one person and give it to another person, you can make comparisons across individuals that we can make across society. And we could even influence your behavior without actually changing your preferences, and that's a very important distinction.
