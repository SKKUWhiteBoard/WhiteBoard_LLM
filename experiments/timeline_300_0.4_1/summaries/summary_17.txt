Machine learning is about how to acquire a model and acquire the parameters of a model, from data and experience. In the next few lectures, we're going to work through a sequence of different takes on machine learning that are going to highlight different subsets of the big ideas on this topic. We'll see today exactly how data kind of goes through the mill and gets turned into a model. And we'll see more in-depth examples and more structured examples of these kinds of problems later on when we talk about applications. the thing we're trying to do is to fit a curve to this data. You can always fit your data more. It's about fitting your data to the point where the patterns that you are capturing are ones which generalize to test. This is definitely over-fitting. Over-fitting shows up not just on these continuous functions. It also shows up, for example, in a hypothetical digit classification, we might say, here is an image I've never seen before. Let's use Naive Bayes to classify it. So what would we do? We'd do our running total.
