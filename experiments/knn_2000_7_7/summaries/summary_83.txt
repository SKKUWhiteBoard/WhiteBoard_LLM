- Hello? Okay, it's after 12, so I want to get started. So today, lecture eight, we're going to talk about deep learning software. This is a super exciting topic because it changes a lot every year. But also means it's a lot of work to give this lecture. But as usual, a couple administrative notes before we dive into the material. So as a reminder the project proposals for your course projects were due on Tuesday. And again, when working on assignment two, remember to stop your Google Cloud instances. different where we're actually building up this new computational graph, this new fresh thing on every forward pass. That's called a dynamic computational graph. In PyTorch because we're using dynamic graphs, it's super simple. Your code kind of looks exactly like you would expect, exactly what you would do in Numpy. And the code is very clean, easy to work with. Now in TensorFlow the situations is a little bit more complicated because we build the graph once, this control flow operator needs to be an explicit operator. And so we have this tf.cond call which kind of like a Tensor Flow version of if statement, but now it's baked into the Python version.
