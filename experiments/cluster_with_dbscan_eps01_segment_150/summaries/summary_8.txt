are or who we love.” “I’m so proud of you,” she says. “You’re so beautiful.’ ““I love you, too,’ I say. I love you so much.“” I’ll always love you. ”I will never forget you. ””“We’ve been through a lot. We’d rather be here than there. ’’” Bayard Rustin was the chief organizer of the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Rustin grew up in a Quaker household, and began peacefully protesting racial segregation in high school. He remained committed to pacifism throughout his life, and was jailed in 1944 as a conscientious objector to World War II. He joined the Communist Party when black American’s civil rights were one of its priorities, but soon became disillusioned by the party's authoritarian leanings and left. In 2013, fifty years after the March On Washington, President Barack Obama posthumously awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
