HONG LIU: Last time, we talked about this IR-UV connection between the bulk and the boundary. Now let's talk about some further aspects of the duality. HONG LIu: Once you realize there's such relation, since the two sides are completely different objects, so the game is that you really have to do lots of guess work.

And on this side, there's precisely the same group, which is isometry of Ads5. In N equals 4 super Yang-Mills theory, we discussed last time there are six scalar fields. You can rotate them each other. And this can be considered as coming from the D3 brane. So essentially, you have eight supercharge of the [INAUDIBLE]. So this all together is 32 real superchargers. a general correspondence between some conformal field theory and some AdS gravity theory. HONG LIU: Yang-Mills theory lives on Minkowski space. And then you say you can imagine that this is the boundary, this relation is related to the bulk and the boundary. And this is a postulate based on that fact. AUDIENCE: So if it's a sort of postulate that's just thinking about it, it's not required that the theory live on the boundary of AdS.
