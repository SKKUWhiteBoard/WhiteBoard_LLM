Rigidity is really about the lack of motion. In infinitesimal motion, you can think about this in the absence of a motion. You need some smoothness. If there's a way to get started moving, that doesn't actually mean you could actually move. So we're going to need some linear algebra. That's one thing that's useful. So the idea is we think about rigidity-- does a linkage move or not-- to the first order. First order means first derivative.
