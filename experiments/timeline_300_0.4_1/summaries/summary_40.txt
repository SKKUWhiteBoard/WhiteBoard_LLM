Danqi Chen is one of the foremost researchers in question answering. She's particularly well known in recent work for her work on using dense passage retrieval methods for open domain question answering, and is the professor at the Princeton University. Danqi once upon a time was the head TA of CS224N. So she's quite familiar with the context of this class. So I'm very happy to introduce to you some of the fundamentals in this field, as well as on cutting edge and state of the art topics.
