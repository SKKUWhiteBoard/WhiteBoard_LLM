Summary:
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Let's just take 10 more seconds. OK. So let's look at this one. So first, you want to notice that you have a plus 1 here. So you've lost an electron. When you start filling the deorbitals, then the energy changes and 4s and 3d switch an energy. And so we could write this one either way. We could have put the 3d first and the 4s second. But importantly now, because of that switch in energy, the electron that is lost is lost from the 3s. 4s over here. So this has to do with the fact that electron configuration of neutral atoms and ions are different. And especially with this 4s-3d switch, that the 3d orbitals drop, change energy when you start to fill them. There's really very similar energy between 4s and 3d. And that leads to some of the exceptions that you're responsible to know that there can be subtle things that switch the energy a little bit. OK. So today's lecture, we're moving on to the periodic table. But we're actually talking about a lot of the things that we just talked. "Today actually turns out to be an awesome review for some of the material that's on the exams" "It's not 100% an old exam from this class because we've never had an exam this early before" "There were no good examples. So if you get old exams from other people, do not freak out when you look at it, and like, oh my goodness. Somehow I haven't learned this." "There are today's lecture and also Friday's lecture we're typically on exam 1" that in mind. So use our practice exams and then you will not have that problem. All right. So moving on to the periodic table. This is very exciting for me. And so today, we're going to talk about trends in the. periodic table, which will be a clicker competition. And then we're Going to go on to Talk about bonding of the elements in the periodic. table. So that's where we're headed. The periodic table is kind of like the artist's paintbox for a chemist or wordsmiths words. These are all the ingredients that go into making everything. ordinary form is coal. Crush it together and diamonds are born. Silicon and oxygen make concrete bricks and glass. Neon's a gas that lights up the sign for a pizza place. The coins that you pay with are copper, nickel, and zinc. Now add some gold and silver for some pizza place class. I think you should check out the ones they call the elements. Like a box of paints that are mixed to make every shade, they either combine to make a chemical compound or stand alone as they are. The song is quite accurate. It has lots of information [INAUDIBLE] them. And it points out some other things like elephants are made of elements. And we're made of elephants-- oh no, wait-- elements. No, it's a really fun, fun song. It really, I think, expresses why It's so important to learn about the properties of the elements and all the things that you can do with them. It's really grouped by the electron configurations, which is one of the things you need to know for the exam. to write these electron configurations. And these reactive metals, it turns out, they only have one valence electron. So they like to react because they want to have a noble gas configuration, so they're very reactive. Now, it doesn't tell you everything. So if you know one element is very safe to consume, that doesn't necessarily mean something right next to it is just as good. And if we consider over here, we consider lithium, sodium, and potassium, sodium and potassium are ions that are really important in the human body. make sure that if you're exercising a lot, that you keep up the amounts that you're getting. So they're very important ions. And they will often hang around and serve as counter-ions to other molecules in your body. So you could have sodium citrate where the sodium is hanging out or potassium citrate. But that doesn't necessarily mean that other things will work as well, like lithium, for example. And citrate makes things taste lemony, which is a lovely taste. And so they said this dispels hangovers. Lithium is often used for people who have bipolar disorders or manic depressive. But it's not something that you should just put in a consumable soda. So it has somewhat different properties, even though it's part of that same group. Just because it's hanging out near its friends, doesn't mean it's going to be exactly the same. It's a lesson that we keep learning over and over again with other things, that you have to be a little more careful with them. Ionization energy is the minimum energy it's going to take to remove an electron from an atom. And so here we have the binding energy of an electron. And we know that this is a multi-electron atom because it depends on n and l. If it was just hydrogen or one other one-electray atom, then anything with n, all those orbitals, are degenerate. But if you have putting inMulti-electrons, then it matters whether you're talking about not just n, but l matters too, whether it's an s orbital or p orbital. This is the energy to move an electron from the highest occupied atomic orbital. The energy involved in this process is the ionization energy. There can be quite a bit of difference in the magnitude of these ionization energies or how hard it is to pull off successive electrons. And I'm going to come back to all of this and sodium and potassium in a little bit. But first, let's just stick with boron for a minute and think more about the different kinds of ionization there. when you have boron plus, you have lost an electron. So you have less electrons available to shield. And if there's less shielding, you're going to have a higher Z effective, less shielding. They'll feel more of the force of the positive charge of the nucleus. And therefore, it's going to take more energy to pull it off. So it'sGoing to be more tightly bound. It's going To be held in because of this less shielding,. higher Zeffective. for number 2, the 3p orbital has two electrons in it. The electrons, by nature, kind of repulse each other, right? So it's a little easier to pop one of those two out than if there was only one electron in there by itself and you're trying to pull it out. So yeah, you'd pick 2 over 3. CATHERINE DRENNAN: OK, yeah. So this one-- oh yeah. OK there, that's better. I can see this more. So across a row, ionization energy is going to increase. And the reason for this is that Z is increasing. So we're having more and more protons, a bigger Z effective. You're also adding electrons though. But n, the shell, remains the same. So if Z is. increasing, n is remaining the same, what do you predict about Z effective? Is it going to. increase, decrease, or stay the same? It's going to increased. So Z effective will also increase. 1 is true. But all of these other ones are also going to be the same because they've just lost more electrons. So all of them have the same configuration. So that doesn't explain what's going on here. And this is also true, but binding energies are always negative. That does not explain anything. So the thing that explains the trend is this one. Even though they all now have the. same configuration, it's going to. be a lot harder to pull off the electron from the one that has the biggest Z effective because that's going. to be bound more tightly. the trend, increasing ionization energy across, decreasing iron energy down, the increase across as the Z effective increase, and down is the increase in n. But when you actually look at ionization energies, which are often reported in kilojoules per mole, versus Z, you see that it's not just kind of a straight line here. So let's look at some of these little glitches. Why isn't this a straighter line here? So I'm now going to blow up this region on this slide here. And I can just put up this diagram again. The ionization energy for beryllium is a bit higher than the ionizationenergy for boron. And so it turns out that this glitch then is we're going from the 2s to the 2p. And 2p, It's easier to pull off that electron. We have another glitch over here. And it's very small. It's a very small little difference. And if you draw out your diagram here, is nitrogen where we have obeyed Hund's rules and we put everything in parallel. But here, the ionisation energy for nitrogen is bigger than for oxygen. we have one extra. So we had to pair the electron. So it turns out it's a little easier to steal this 2p electron because it's the first one paired. And I kind of think about that as, again, sort of the bus where everyone sits. You can sit two people per seat. One person sits down, no one else wants to sit next to them until all the seats are taken. And sometimes when you're sitting in the seat, you're really, really, happy when that person gets up who's sitting next to you. Photoelectron spectroscopy, PES, is used to determine ionization values. And so you can have some energy that you will use to excite something like neon, which is gas which lights up a sign for a pizza place. And you can inject an electron from it that has a certain amount of kinetic energy. And what you actually measure in this technique is the velocity of the electron. But from velocity, as you know, you can get kinetic energy and from kinetic energy, we can get ionization energy. to something that will be an exam 1 where we're talking about using photons and shooting them at metal surfaces and ejecting electrons that have kinetic energy. This is basically all the same idea here. So in this particular case, you would measure three different velocities or three different kinetic energies. And now we can think about what those should probably correspond to using our chemistry knowledge. And then this kinetic energy is less. So we're going to get a higher ionization energy of 48. And this is really small. And so now we get an ionization energy of 870. And again, this is a multi-electron system. So then the energy is going to depend on the two quantum numbers. It depends on l and n. It matters what specific orbital you're talking about. So let's just think about another problem here. Suppose you had five really distinct kinetic energies. Assume that the lowest ionizationenergy to take an electron out of 2p, next would be to 2s, and then the hardest electron to eject would be from the 1s. a very distinct kinetic energy means a different subshell. And so then we want to think about what are the possible elements in the. periodic table that could produce a spectrum with these five very, very. distinct kinetic energies? And so the way you think about this is you want to find what elements are going to have five different kinds of orbitals. And those are over here. And then you need to know from the periodic table where are the elements where you're filling the 3p. So again, we talked and these problems aren't on the exam. periodic table. But you need to be able to know what orbitals are being filled in the different parts of the periodic table. So let's move on and talk about electron affinity. And maybe we can squeeze in some electronegativity at the end. These are very related topics and pretty fast. All right. So electron affinity-- the ability to gain electrons. So what we're talking about here is how likely atom X is to become an atom X. So I think if we get the counting down we'll be good. grab an electron and become X minus. So we often think about halogens when we're talking about this like chlorine. And here the change in energy associated with gaining that electron is minus 349 kilojoules per mole. Energy is released. And that means that the ion is more stable than the parent. So chloride is very happy to become Cl minus. But nitrogen plus an electron, going to N minus, has a positive energy value here and has a negative electron affinity. So it is not as happy as chloride to do this. Nobel gases have negative electron affinities. If you had to add another electron to them, you would need to make a new subshell there, which they don't want to do. halogens, on the other hand, which are right next door, have highest electron affinity. So if you're over here, they want to gain an electron and become a noble gas. Noble gases want to stay the way they are. So the increase trend ends right before you get to the noble gases.

Summary:
The morphological unit of life is the cell, whether you're a flea or you're an elephant. We all have the same biological molecules that play a major role inside our bodies, like sugar or fat, or amino acids, or nucleotides. And we all have same major regulatory mechanisms, although as you go from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, things get more complex. And so what we cover in the course is, in fact, most of the things we talk about are bacterial systems because they're better studied. but can be extrapolated between the two systems. That's the major focus of a biochemist. You want to understand things at the molecular level, but then you need to understand what you see inside the cell. You need to go back and forth between inside thecell and understanding the chemical and physical principles by which all the reactions work. It's a back-and-forth process, but it's very important to get the right answer at the end of the day, says the scientist.

Summary:
When we analyze the problem about putting two blocks along a frictionless surface and pushing one and asking, what is the maximum force such that block 2 does not slip? We have three different systems. And now I want to focus a little bit on what would happen if we just naively chose our systems as both blocks together. So let's try to look at the types of issues that come up when we do that. So once again, let's draw free body diagrams. Now, we begin. internal forces. And we saw that they were friction forces, f12 and f21. This was the friction force between the two blocks. There were normal forces between these two blocks, but these are interaction pairs. And so we see that all internal forces form Newton's third law interaction pairs and the vector sum of them are 0. And that's why I don't need those internal forces on my free body diagram. If I were to draw them, I would have different arrows. And you can see that the sum of those cancel. F equals m1 plus m2 times the acceleration of the system. And so we have our i hat and our j hat directions. And now, we didn't include the kinetic friction force of the ground in that system. So let's make sure that that's there. And in the vertical direction, we have n ground 1 minus m1plus m2 g equals 0. That gave us our same result before. Notice that f equals fk plus m1PlusM2 g. divided by m1 m2. But notice because our static friction is an internal force in this system, it never shows up in Newton's second law, so we were never able to apply the condition that f static max was mu static n, what we call the normal force between the blocks. All we can say is if I push f, that's the acceleration. But I cannot determine what maximum force will cause block 2 to slip with respect to block 1. So the art to choosing systems and free body diagrams is to think about the types of questions you're asking. If you have a question that involves something about a maximum condition on static friction, then you want to make sure that static friction is an external force to your system. If it's an internal force, like in this case, you will not be able to apply that condition.
