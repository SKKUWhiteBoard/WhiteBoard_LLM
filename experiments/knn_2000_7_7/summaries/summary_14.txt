JUDY HOYT: Hopefully everybody's recovered from their Thanksgiving feast. What I'm showing up here is the schedule to orient us. This is lecture 22. We'll talk about silicides, device contacts, and I've added in a new material this year on novel gate materials. And then next week we have two class periods scheduled. There'll be four speakers in each. And those will be the oral reports and the student reports given on Tuesday and Thursday. And I just want to remind people, if you're doing an oral report, you're expected to provide handouts. The resistance of a given contact in ohms is just the voltage divided by the current flowing through that contact. If I make a smaller contact area for a given specific contact resistivity, you're going to have a higher resistance. This is a problem if I'm scaling devices. Unless we do something to make better contacts as we scale devices, just because of this geometric factor. The second type of contact-- again, this is one that's not generally considered desirable, but we need to understand a little bit of the physics of it.
