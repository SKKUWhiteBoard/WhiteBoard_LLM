The science of classical mechanics establishes an important principle of cause and effect. Newton's Laws of Motion established the scientific principle of analyzing observed phenomenon through the use of clearly articulated mathematical models rather than through intuition. Developing a command of mechanics is a powerful tool for understanding the world around us. 8.01 assumes a strong background in high school level physics and mathematics, so a previous course in calculus is not a prerequisite. It is a rigorous and technically challenging course aimed at MIT undergraduates. In each of these lessons, you will find a series of short lightboard videos that will help you understand concepts.
