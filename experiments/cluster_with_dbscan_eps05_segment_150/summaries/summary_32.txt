Professor: "It is impossible to represent the half integer states with a wave function which represents a probability distribution on a sphere" "The bigger the magnetic moment, the bigger the deflection" "If the force is proportional to the strength of your magnet, then how far-- if you send this magnet through a region, it'll get deflected in one direction or the other" "How far it gets deflected is determined by how big of a magnet you sent through. You send in a bigger magnet, it deflects more" nice bit of experimental data, but we've discovered the energy is, in fact, not just independent of m, but it's independent of l, too. Why? What symmetry is explaining this extra degeneracy? We'll pick that up next time. Back to Mail Online home. back to the page you came from. Click here to read the rest of the article.

If you're spinning, and you pull in your arms, you have to do work, right? You have to pull those guys in. You're increasing your kinetic energy due to conservation of angular momentum,right? If you have rotationally invariance, as you bring in your hand you're increasing the kinetic energy. And so, here's the first thing, so we look at this equation. So, we had this differential equation-- this guy-- and we want to solve it.
