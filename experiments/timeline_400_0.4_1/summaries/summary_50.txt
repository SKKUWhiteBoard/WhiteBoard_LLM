RAFAEL JARAMILLO: Let's talk about intermediate phases and line compounds. He recalls intermediate phase in a three-phase system. He draws a free-energy composition diagram in such a case. Jaramillo: All possible common tangents are going to converge at the same point. He says this type of structure is a Laves compound, which is also known as Laves Laves, or Laves' compound. It's a broad structure, he says, and it can be used to develop new materials.
