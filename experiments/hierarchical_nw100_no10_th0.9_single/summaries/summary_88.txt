Federal agencies rely on computerized information systems to process, maintain, and report large volumes of sensitive data. Ineffective protection of these systems and information can impair delivery of vital services and result in loss or theft of computer resources, assets, and funds. IRS employs about 90,000 people in its Washington, D.C., headquarters and at more than 550 offices in all 50 states, U.S. territories, and some embassies and consulates. During fiscal year 2015, IRS collected more than $3.3 trillion; processed more than 243 million tax returns and other forms.
