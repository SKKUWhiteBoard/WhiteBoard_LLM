Of the nearly 11,000 amendments proposed in the centuries since, only 27 have succeeded. The founders of the United States were trying to create a unified country from thirteen different colonies. For an amendment to even be proposed, it must receive a two-thirds vote of approval in both houses of Congress. To actually change the Constitution, the amendment must be ratified by three-quarters of all states. Americans today are the most politically polarized since the Civil War, making it nearly impossible to reach a broad consensus. Court justices are unelected and serve for life once appointed, this is far from the most democratic option. Interestingly, the founders themselves may have foreseen this problem early on. In a letter to James Madison, Thomas Jefferson wrote that laws should expire every 19 years rather than having to be changed or repealed. Although he believed that the basic principles of the Constitution would endure, he stressed that the Earth belongs to the living, and not to the dead. He wrote that every political process is full of obstacles that distort the will of the people.
