OMB M-04-04, E-Authentication Guidance for Federal Agencies, addresses federal government services accomplished using the Internet, instead of on paper. This guidance established four levels of identity assurance for electronic transactions requiring authentication. Each level describes the agency’s degree of certainty that a user has presented an identifier that refers to his or her identity. NIST Special Publication 800-63-2, Electronic Authentication Guideline, provides technical guidelines for federal agencies implementing electronic authentication. Successful authentication occurs when an individual proves through the means of authentication that he or she possesses and controls the token. The cryptographic methods used at this level may still allow someone with malicious intent to intercept the transmission of a password through eavesdropping and crack it using a dictionary attack. Approved cryptographic methods should be strong enough to protect against impersonation of the verifying entity. Level 4: Is intended to provide the highest practical remote network authentication assurance, requiring at least two authentication factors. It would not allow the type of eavesdropping attack that is possible at Level 1. This is a work of the U.S. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the United States.

In May 2015 DHS issued its first directive, which required all departments and agencies to review and mitigate all critical vulnerabilities on their Internet-facing systems. Risks to cyber-based assets can originate from unintentional or intentional threats. Unintentional threats can be caused by natural disasters, defective computer or network equipment, software coding errors, and the actions of careless or poorly trained employees. Intentional threats include targeted and untargeted attacks from criminal groups, hackers, disgruntled employees, foreign nations engaged in espionage and information warfare, and terrorists. These adversaries vary in terms of their capabilities, willingness to act, and motives. These threat sources make use of various techniques—or exploits—that may adversely affect federal information. various techniques—or exploits—that may adversely affect federal information, computers, software, networks, and operations. These exploits are carried out through various conduits, including websites, e-mails, wireless and cellular communications, Internet protocols, portable media, and social media. Further, adversaries can leverage common computer software programs as a means by which to deliver a threat by embedding exploits within software files that can be activated when a user opens a file within its corresponding program. The number of information security incidents affecting systems supporting the federal government is increasing. the opportunity to use a suite of tools and capabilities to identify cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis. National Cybersecurity Protection System: NCPS is an integrated system-of-systems intended to deliver a range of capabilities for intrusion detection, intrusion prevention, analytics, and information sharing. When deployed on an agency’s connection to the Internet, the system monitors inbound and outbound traffic for malicious activity. In summary, while IRS has made progress in implementing information security controls, it needs to continue to address weaknesses in the system. benefits, and risks of its authentication options. IRS officials told us that the agency had developed guidance for its Identity Assurance Office to assess costs, benefits, and risk of authentication tools. IRS plans to complete a strategic plan for taxpayer authentication across the agency in September 2016. strengthening the security posture of IRS—and other agencies— also depends on the key roles played by OMB, NIST, and DHS in providing oversight and guidance from a government-wide perspective, such as that related to improving authentication. Federal law gives OMB the power of enforcement and accountability related to evaluating agencies’ management of their information resources. In particular, in enforcing accountability, OMB is empowered to recommend reductions or increases in an agency’s budget and restrict the availability of funds for information resources, among other things. OMB established the OMB Cyber and National Security Unit (OMB Cyber) within the Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer. This unit is responsible for strengthening federal cybersecurity through oversight of agency and government-wide programs. Federal agencies are to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program. The head of each agency is responsible for ensuring that senior agency officials carry out their information security responsibilities. The act also assigned OMB and the Department of Homeland Security oversight responsibilities to assist agencies in effectively implementing information security protections. IRS relies extensively on computerized information systems to protect sensitive financial and taxpayer data for the collection of taxes, processing of information security incidents, and guidelines for identifying an information system as a national security system. to provide the highest practical remote network authentication assurance, requiring the proof of possession of a key through a cryptographic protocol. At this level in-person identity proofing is required. It is otherwise similar to Level 3, except with stronger cryptographic methods in place. Federal law also gives OMB and DHS responsibility and authority for oversight of operational aspects of federal information security. In particular, the OMB Director is charged with overseeing and enforcing agency compliance with information security requirements by taking certain actions authorized by relevant federal law. developing and overseeing the implementation of policies, principles, standards, and guidelines on information security in federal agencies. The director is also responsible for coordinating the development of standards and guidelines by NIST. For its part, NIST is responsible under FISMA for developing security standards for agencies. NIST, Federal Information Processing Standard 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems, requires agencies to categorize their information systems as low-impact, moderate-impact or high-impact. process for selecting the security controls necessary to satisfy these requirements. NIST Special Publication 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations, provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for federal information systems and organizations. OMB and NIST also have provided guidance to agencies on procedures for authenticating users to federal systems and websites, including the following: OMB M-15-13, Policy to Require Secure Connections across Federal Websites and Web Services, which requires all publicly accessible federal websites and web services to provide service through a secure connection. As technology has advanced, the federal government has become increasingly dependent on computerized information systems. Federal agencies rely on such systems to process, maintain, and report large volumes of sensitive data, such as personal information. Ineffective protection of these systems and information can impair delivery of vital services and result in loss or theft of computer resources, assets, and funds. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014, among other things, requires the head of each agency to provide information security protections. The IRS collects and maintains a significant amount of personal and financial information on each U.S. taxpayer. The size and complexity of the IRS add unique operational challenges. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has overall responsibility for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information and systems that support the agency and its operations. Within IRS, the senior agency official responsible for information security is the Associate CIO, who heads the IRS Information Technology department.

IRS estimated that it prevented or recovered $22.5 billion in fraudulent IDT refunds in filing season 2014. IRS has taken steps to address IDT refund fraud; however, it remains a persistent and evolving threat. In 2015, IRS reported allocating more than 4,000 full-time equivalent staff and spending $470 million on refund fraud and IDT activities. In addition, IRS received an additional $290 million for fiscal year 2016 to improve customer service, IDT identification and prevention, and cybersecurity. Identity thieves can easily find this information, allowing them to bypass IRS’s automatic checks. IRS did not document lessons learned from periodic analyses of its breach response efforts. The importance of protecting taxpayer information is further highlighted by the billions of dollars that have been lost to IDT refund fraud, which continues to be an evolving threat. These continuing challenges highlight the need for additional actions by IRS. There are steps IRS can take to, among other things, better authenticate the identity of taxpayers before issuing refunds. IRS temporarily suspended the Identity Protection Personal Identification Number (IP PIN) service on IRS.gov. The IP PIN is a single-use identification number provided to taxpayers who are victims of identity theft (IDT) The service allowed taxpayers to retrieve their IP PINs online by passing IRS’s authentication checks. As of April 7, the online service was still suspended. The IRS stated that it was conducting further review of the IP PIN service and is looking at further strengthening the security features. integrity of transmitted or stored data. IRS established policies and procedures for auditing and monitoring its systems. The agency continued to expand its use of encryption to protect sensitive data. But it had not established logging for two key applications used to support the transfer of financial data and access and manage taxpayer accounts. It also was not consistently maintaining key system and application audit plans, the report found.. The report also found that the IRS had failed to adequately protect its computer resources, including a dedicated guard force at each of its computer centers. Identifying and authenticating users provides the basis for establishing accountability and controlling access to a system. IRS established policies for identification and authentication, including requiring multifactor authentication for local and network access accounts. IRS used easily guessable passwords on servers supporting key systems. IRS continued to expand the use of two- factor access to its network. But IRS had not fully implemented unique user identification and. authentication or remote electronic authentication that complies with federal requirements, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration said. “least privilege,” granting users the least amount of rights and privileges necessary to perform their duties. IRS established policies for authorizing access to its systems, but continued to permit excessive access in some cases. For example, users were granted rights and permissions in excess of what they needed to do their jobs. Cryptography controls protect sensitive data and computer programs by rendering data unintelligible to unauthorized users and protecting the integrity of transmitted or stored data. IRS policies require the use of encryption to protect data. incidents reported by federal agencies to the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) increased from 5,503 in fiscal year 2006 to 67,168 in 2014. According to OMB, agencies reported 77,183 incidents in fiscalyear 2015. For fiscal year 2015, OMB reported that federal agencies spent about $13.1 billion on cybersecurity, and agencies budgeted about $14 billion for cybersecurity for fiscal year 2016. Similarly, the number of incidents involving PII reported byFederal agencies has more than doubled in recent years. budgeted about $14 billion for cybersecurity for fiscal year 2016. This amount may increase significantly, as the president’s fiscal year 2017 budget proposes investing over $19 billion in resources for cybersecurity. Cyber incidents can adversely affect national security, damage public health and safety, and compromise sensitive information. In June 2015, the Commissioner of the IRS testified that unauthorized third parties had gained access to taxpayer information from its Get Transcript application. According to officials, criminals used taxpayer- specific data acquired from non-agency sources to gain access. During fiscal year 2015, IRS collected more than $3.3 trillion; processed more than 243 million tax returns and other forms. IRS employs about 90,000 people in its Washington, D.C., headquarters and at more than 550 offices in all 50 states, U.S. territories, and some embassies and consulates. To manage its data and information, the agency operates two enterprise computing centers. It also collects and maintains a significant amount of personal and financial data for the collection of taxes. used taxpayer- specific data acquired from non-agency sources to gain unauthorized access to information on approximately 100,000 tax accounts. These data included Social Security information, dates of birth, and street addresses. In an August 2015 update, IRS reported this number to be about 114,000. In a February 2016 update, the agency reported that an additional 390,000 accounts had been accessed. The online Get Transcript service has been unavailable since May 2015. In March 2016, IRS stated that as part of its ongoing addition to the 49 outstanding recommendations from previous audits—will help IRS improve its controls for identifying and authenticating users. IRS Commissioner stated that while the agency agreed with our new recommendations, it will review them to ensure that its actions include sustainable fixes. Table 1 below provides the number of our prior recommendations to IRS that were not implemented at the beginning of our fiscal year 2015 audit, how many were resolved by the end of the audit, and the total number of outstanding recommendations at the recommendations. IRS had yet to address weaknesses in its review of access lists for both employees and visitors to sensitive areas. IRS had not updated key mainframe policies and procedures to address issues such as comprehensively auditing and monitoring access. The agency had not fully mitigated governance of IRS and therefore represented a significant deficiency in IRS’s internal control over financial reporting systems as of September 30, 2015, the report says. The report makes two new recommendations to more effectively implement security-related policies and plans. monitoring access. The agency had not fully mitigated previously identified deficiencies or ensured that its corrective actions were effective. IRS told us it had completed corrective actions for 28 of our prior recommendations; however, we determined that 9 of these had not been effectively implemented. The collective effect of the deficiencies in information security from prior years that continued to exist in fiscal year 2015, along with the new deficiencies we identified, are serious enough to merit the attention of those charged with governance of IRS and therefore represented a significant deficiency in IRS governance. In December 2013 we reported on the extent to which data breach policies at eight agencies, including IRS, adhered to requirements and guidance set forth by OMB and NIST. With respect to IRS, we determined that its policies and procedures generally reflected key practices, although the agency did not require considering the number of affected individuals as a factor when determining security controls. IRS needs to continue to address weaknesses in access controls and configuration management and consistently implement all elements of its information security program, the authors say. security patch updates were applied in a timely manner to databases supporting two key systems we reviewed, including a patch that had been available since August 2012. IRS had established policies for developing contingency plans for its information systems and for testing those plans, as well as for implementing and enforcing backup procedures. The agency had documented and tested contingency plans and backup procedures, the review found. The review also found that the IRS had implemented and enforced backup procedures as required by law, and that information resources were protected.
