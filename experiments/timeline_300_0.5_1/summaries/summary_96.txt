HONG LIU: Today, we talk about chiral fermions. He says the Dirac equation requires, actually, psi to have four components. But there are two ways to reduce it, and one is called the Majorana fermion, he says. HONG LIu: You don't need four components to be able to transform under Lorentz. You just need a smaller unit, OK? He says this tells you that at least two components already can transform. we have-- so this real scalar theory-- we can see that before. So this theory has a discrete symmetry because this is invariant under phi. It goes to minus phi, OK? So this is-- if you do it twice, you go back to itself. OK, so this is called the Z2 symmetry. And there are also spacetime discrete symmetries. So you can have so-called time reversal, which corresponding to your t, x goes to plus t. And so, altogether, they are called CPT symmetry. Yeah.
