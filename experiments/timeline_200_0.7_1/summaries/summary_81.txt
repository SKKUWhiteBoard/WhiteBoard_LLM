In order to do that, I basically have to do the integral. So here it is. We have psi of x and t. It's integral dk phi of k e to the ikx minus omega of kt. If you want to see the distortion, you have to keep that [INAUDIBLE]. We'll do that in a week from now. And then, you probably need to think a second. And you say, look. There's lots of things making it look like a difficult integral, but it's not as difficult as it looks. here, e to the minus i omega of k0 t e to ik and some number that you call x, which has been changed to this. And now I can put phi of k to the i k x minus these two exponentials, d omega dk at k0 times t. And I ignore this. So far so good. For this kind of wave, we already get a very nice result because look at this thing. This quantity can be written in terms of the wave function at time equals 0.
