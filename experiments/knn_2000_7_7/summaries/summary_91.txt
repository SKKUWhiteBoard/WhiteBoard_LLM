Professor Donald Kagan: Sparta is the most important of the early poleis. He says the only decisions made were questions of whether to go to war, whether to make peace. Kagan says when a question was put to the Spartans, they responded by shouting and banging on their shields. The only people who spoke at those assemblies were the kings, the gerousia, or a group of people I haven't mentioned to you yet, the ephors, the five ephor.
