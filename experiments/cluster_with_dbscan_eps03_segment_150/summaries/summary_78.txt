When a particle's undergoing circular motion, it has a velocity that you can describe, which is the tangential motion around the circle. And it also has an angular velocity, which we define as being in a direction that's perpendicular to that direction of rotation. Let's now look at rotation in an arbitrary plane. So if I have a plane like this and I have some particle traveling in a circle like this, then it will see this rotation with these directions. So we can define d theta dt to be the component of the angular velocity omega z. dt. So when a particle's undergoing circular motion, it has a velocity that you can describe, which is the tangential motion around the circle. And it also has an angular velocity, which we define as being in a direction that's perpendicular to that direction of rotation. And so this is another way that we can write the velocity and connect it back to the angular velocity. And now that we have defined this omega z, the component of the angular Velocity, we can rewrite the velocity as just being equal to r times omega z still in that theta hat direction. as being in the counterclockwise direction. Whereas if I have another observer down here and they're looking up at this plane, they'll see the motion as being clock wise. And so you can see we have a need for a more formal definition for the rotation of this. So what we're going to do is use the right hand rule to define a direction that tells you both the direction it defines the plane and it also tells you what the positive direction of rotation is for that plane.
