GILBERT STRANG: The heat equation is the second of the three basic partial differential equations. He says the dependence on t is fast decay, and if K, as K gets larger, later terms in this sum, the decay is really fast. Strang: The term that decays most slowly, k equal 1, there'll be a B1, an e to the minus, pi squared t. The heat is flowing around in the bar, and where is it going? The bar is approaching freezing. ends are kept at freezing, and the inside of the bar, whatever heat is there at the beginning, is going to flow out the ends. So I have an ordinary heated bar, and I put it in the freezer. I insulate the sides so the heat is escaping out the two ends, out the end x equals 0. And the solution will be, let me remember what the general solution looked like. And from that, I find the Bk's, and then the final solution. T greater than 0 uses those Bks. And we're again faced with a Fourier series problem. differential equation. We have a whole function to match, so we need all of those. And Fourier series tells us how to do that matching, how to find these Bk's. So that's a separate and important question, Fourierseries. Thank you for your time. Back to Mail Online home.
