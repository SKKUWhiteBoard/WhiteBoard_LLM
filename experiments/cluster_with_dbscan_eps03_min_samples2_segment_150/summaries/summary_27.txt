The fundamental theorem of calculus can be used to solve any differential equation. The product rule says take the derivative of [INAUDIBLE] that is e to the minus t is one. So the two terms from the product rule are the two term in the differential equation, which is dy dt. The derivative of that product is one term will be y and the otherterm will be q. That's a remarkable formula for the solution to a basic differential equation and it's a key example in differential equations. rather I just called the function f. A function at a point a little beyond t, is approximately the function at t plus the correction because it-- plus a delta f, right? A delta f approximately? It's approximately delta t times the derivative at t. Just draw a picture. So let me draw a graph of-- oh there's the graph of e to the t. So it starts up with slope 1. Let me give it a little slope here. OK the tangent line, and of course it comes down here Not below. this isn't so practical. Tangent parabola, quite practical. Higher order terms, less-- much less practical. But the formula is beautiful because you see the pattern, that's really what mathematics is about. They all fit that pattern and when you add up all the terms, if you have a nice function, then the approximation becomes perfect and you would have equality. And those are the best functions of mathematics and exponential is of course one of them. OK that's calculus. Well, part of calculus. GILBERT STRANG: Differential equations is the big application of calculus. He says you really do need to know basic derivatives. Strang: You can create the derivatives of an enormous array of functions using the key rules. He shows how to create the parabola, the Taylor series, the tangent line and the Taylor ratio, among other things, to get a good idea of how to solve a differential equation. He concludes by saying, "I think it's worth thinking about what we know"
