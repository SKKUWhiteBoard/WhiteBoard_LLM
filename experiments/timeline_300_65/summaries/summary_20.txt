In this video i'm going to be covering sinus tachycardia. sinus tells us that we're dealing with a heart rhythm that originates in the sa node. The sa node is really the starting point of the electrical conduction system. If this process is occurring like it should it should cause this heart to beat at about 60 to 100 beats per minute on the ecg. On the flip side let's say that this sa nodes is disease it's causing the heart to beating slowly. Sinus tachycardia can be caused by disease or non-disease related causes. It can be a sign that a patient's disease is worsening. It's a warning sign that hey this needs to be investigated more. If a patient has sinus tack you want to investigate it you don't want to just write it off. It may be their thyroid is yelp and any time they have pain that is not being controlled it can definitely lead to sinus tachycardsia.
