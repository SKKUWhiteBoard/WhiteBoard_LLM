comparison for yourself then tell us of your results you might be surprised. What do you think of my test and my results have you ever tried something like this before do you use preference when cold fermenting let me know down in comments.

The principles of baking show us how to make bread with and without a bereavement. We'll make three breads one with the brief mint and two without one of the breads without the bereavement will be bulk fermented in the fridge for 24 hours. The third one will be made with a brief mint which will be left for 12 hours to ferment then it'll be mixed into the main dough. The breads will then take the same amount of time to make but why would you add the extra step of making a briefment when cold fermenting?
