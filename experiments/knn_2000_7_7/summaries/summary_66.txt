Professor: Today we're going to talk about partial differential equations. Professor Swan is going to do a review on Friday. Next time I'll be lecturing to you will be a week from Friday. The homework following the quiz will be posted and so you guys can get started on that. For example, if you wanted to solve the Schrodinger equation for h2 plus, it turns out there's a special coordinate system called the elliptic coordinate system. And in that coordinate system, the partial differential equation is separable. can figure a better way to do it. This kind of thing is called method of lines. And in certain systems like this, it's a smart thing to do. You need to be kind of lucky that the set up is right, so you can use it. But if you can, it can be pretty good. All right. I think I'll stop there. See you on Friday. The world is waiting for you to come back and tell us what you've learned this week.
