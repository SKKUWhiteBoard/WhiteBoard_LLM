angular momentum is a set of operators that provided observables, things we can measure. We found that they satisfy a series of commutators in which lx with ly gave ih bar lz. We showed that any component of angular momentum, be it lx, ly, or lz, commutes with l squared. And therefore, we set up for the search of those wave functions that are simultaneous eigenstates of one of the three components of angularmomentum. wanted single valued wave functions-- wave functions would be the same at phi, and at Phi plus 2 pi, which is the same point. You must choose m to be an integer. For the l squared operator we also explained that the eigenvalue of this operator should be positive. That is achieved when l, whatever it is, is greater than 0. And the discussion that led to the quantization of l was a little longer, took a bit more work. Happily we have this operator, and operator we can diagonalize, or we can find eigenstates for it. Professor: If you have a system you want to figure out what are the properties of the states. In general, you will be led in any physical problem to look for the maximal set of commuting operators, he says. Professor: We'll begin the hydrogen atom and this task why? Having a proton and an electron we can reduce this system to as if we had one particle in a central potential, so that will be also very important physically. He says the answer was simple. You have a particle with some momentum in one direction or in the reverse direction. In general when we choose a general l, if you choose an arbitrary l, then m goes from minus l, minus l plus 1 all the way up to l. If you choose state with l equals 1, or eigenfunctions with l equal 1, there is the possibility of having m equals minus 1, 0, or 1. The spherical harmonicas are going to be those wave functions. And they have a normalization, n l m, an exponention, and all that.
