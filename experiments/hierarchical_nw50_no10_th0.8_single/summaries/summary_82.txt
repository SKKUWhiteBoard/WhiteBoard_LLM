DHS and Coast Guard acquisition guidelines require operational test and evaluation by an independent test agency. Coast Guard uses U.S. Navyâ€™s COTF to conduct operational tests and other evaluations for its major acquisition programs. In conducting operational testing, testers determine an asset's operational effectiveness and suitability. For operational suitability, testers determines whether or not the agency can logistically support the asset to an acceptable standard, such as having the asset available for operations 85 percent of its scheduled deployment time.
