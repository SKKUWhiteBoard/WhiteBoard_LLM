In this section, we're going to talk about the relativistic Doppler effect. We make good use of our space-time diagrams, which we discussed earlier. The question is how is this being observed by an observer which is moving with a relative velocity v with respect to the source? So we have to apply Lorentz transformation. And we find then-- this is a little bit of an algebra exercise here-- that the period now is given by 1 plus beta over 1 minus beta square root of that times tau.
