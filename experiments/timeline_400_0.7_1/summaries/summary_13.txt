Ani was a real person, a scribe from the Egyptian city of Thebes who lived in the 13th century BCE. His Book of the Dead, a 78-foot papyrus scroll, was designed to help him attain immortality. Ani's epic journey begins with his death. His body is mummified by a team of priests who remove every organ except the heart. It's then stuffed with a salt called natron and wrapped in resin-soaked linen. In addition, the wrappings are woven with charms for protection and topped with a heart scarab amulet.
