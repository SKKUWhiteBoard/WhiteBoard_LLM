Marginal rate of substitution of good 1 with respect to good 2 is infinity. When we are talking about marginal rate of. substitution of milk and cola, it would still be infinity, but marginal rate. of substitution. of cola withrespect to milk is 0.75. So, when we do not say when we say just MRS, we are not using any particular term, you can use both way. Instead of getting x you get 1 by x, and why? Let us see what do we mean by marginal rates of substitution mathematically. To get 1 good you will have to give up the other good, both what we are assuming that both these items are good, means they give certain satisfaction or certain you know utility to the person, and what we want. We want this person to have the same level of utility by consuming one of these two bundles. So, of course, when we are increasing the amount of 1 good to bring what will happen using this, if we use the monotonicity what will happening. If more of 1Good what is happening let us see. From here you are moving here in this direction. see, that MRS is given as a positive number, that only means that the author has introduced a negative sign here to convert the MRS into apositive number. So, it does not matter. Is it clear? Do you know the answer to this question? If so, please email us at jennifer.smith@mailonline.co.uk. If you don't, we would like to hear from you. Please send us a photo of your MRS and we will send it to you.
