Social Security plays an important role in reducing poverty, not only among the aged but among children as well. Children may be eligible for Social Security benefits when a parent who is a covered worker dies, becomes disabled, or retires. Unlike welfare programs, eligibility is determined on the basis of limited income, Social Security is a work-related entitlement, in which benefits are determined. In December 2012, 3.3 million Social Security beneficiaries (5.7% of all beneficiaries) were children under the age of 18. Average monthly benefit among child beneficiaries in December 2012 was $525.
