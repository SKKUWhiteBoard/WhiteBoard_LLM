that can sometimes improve performance. And we actually have that trick in the assignment 4 system. And you can try it out. So we generate along and generate our whole sentence in this manner. And that's proven to be a very effective way of getting more information from the source sentence more flexibly to allow us to generate a good translation. I'll stop here for now and at the start of next time. I will finish this off by going through the actual equations for how attention works. In week four, we take a break from learning more and more on neural network topics, and talk about final projects, but also some practical tips for building neural network systems. Today's lecture is the primary content for what you'll be using for building your assignment 4 systems. In the early 1950s, there started to be work on machine translation. Claims were made that the computer would replace most human translators. When you go in for full scale production what will the capacity be? We should be able to do about with a modern commercial computer about one to two million words an hour.
