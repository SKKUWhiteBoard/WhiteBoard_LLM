In the 112 th Congress (2011-2012), the House and Senate began observing what has been referred to as an earmark moratorium or earmark ban. The moratorium does not exist in House or Senate rules, however, and therefore is not enforced by points of order. Instead, the moratorium has been established by party rules and committee protocols and is enforced by chamber and committee leadership through their agenda-setting power. House rules generally require that certain legislation be accompanied by a list of congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits. add additional transparency to the earmarking process. Congress could also restrict the purposes for which an earmark might be used or prohibit certain entities from receiving earmarks entirely. The House Appropriations Committee announced that it would no longer consider earmarks directed to for-profit entities. Congress also could involve the executive branch by requiring agency inspectors general to audit spending for earmarked projects in order to ensure that the funds are being used for their intended purpose. This might involve further research into the practice of earmarks generally. asking CRS or the Government Accountability Office to perform research or creating a select committee to study earmarks and recommend new policies or restrictions.
