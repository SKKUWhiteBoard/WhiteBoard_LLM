Professor Amy Hungerford: Today it is my great privilege and pleasure to introduce Andrew Goldstone, a TF in this course. Andrew is a fourth-year student in the Ph.D. program in English, and he is writing a dissertation on the autonomy of the work of art in modernism. On Monday we had three main themes that were used to introduce this novel to you. And that's the question that I'm mostly going to focus on today. I'm going to bracket the ethical question, leave that for Monday's lecture.
