Bureau of Reclamation's Friant Dam on the San Joaquin River became fully operational in the 1940s. As a result, approximately 60 miles of the river is dry in most years, making it impossible to support Chinook salmon populations. A U.S. District Court judge has since ruled that operation ofFriant Dam violates state law. Parties agreed to negotiate a settlement instead of proceeding to trial on a remedy regarding the court's ruling.. Full implementation of the Settlement would require congressional authorization and appropriations. If Congress does not act on the legislation, some fear that the court will order a remedy that may differ from the Settlement.
