So let me say here just the repetition, normal, inferior. Let us say we are talking about price of good 1 has gone up substitution, income these are the effects and overall. When P 1 goes up subs because of substitution effect x 1 will. Come down. And for income also because of income effect it will come down. So, overall it comes down. While inferior goods substitution effect quantity demanded would come down while income effect is Up. Up. Can you give me an example its very very difficult to find Giffen good in real life why? Luxury goods are not Giffen goods. Luxury goods can't be termed as good if prices come down by significant amount. Income effect has to be larger than substitution effect. It means significant portion of your income is gone in buying these items so that is not true. We have very-very hard time getting finding out, figuring out GIFFen good in an economy. Sir, like if Gucci is a brand and it is. Prices comes down bysignificant amount. No one could buy a Gucci, it is at that level only because of it is prices.
