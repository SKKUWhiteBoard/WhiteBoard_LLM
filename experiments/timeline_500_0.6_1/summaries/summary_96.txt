HONG LIU: Today, we talk about chiral fermions. He says the Dirac equation requires, actually, psi to have four components. But there are two ways to reduce it, and one is called the Majorana fermion, he says. HONG LIu: You don't need four components to be able to transform under Lorentz. You just need a smaller unit, OK? He says this tells you that at least two components already can transform. to impose in this basis. And this is now independent of massless or massive particles? HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, this is-- yeah. Good? So this concludes our discussion of the Majorana spinor. Do you have any questions on this? Yes? AUDIENCE: So is the orthogonal component of this Majorana species-- like, possible-- in the chiral one, like, psi L, and then you [INAUDIBLE] and then psi R. just reverse one direction or reverse two directions, OK? That seems also to be a discrete symmetry. And indeed. So if you just change the directions, say, in the x direction, that's also a discrete. And if you only change the direction in both x and the y direction, That's also an independent symmetry. But if you change-- if you do the reflection in two directions,. that's equivalent to a 90-degree rotation. And so it's part of the continuous symmetries. And now, when you change all three directions compared to change one direction, you differ only by changing two directions.
