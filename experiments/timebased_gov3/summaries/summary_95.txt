A history of the federal excise tax on tires shows that initial adoption occurred as a result of the revenue needs of World War I. Today's excise tax derives from the re-institution of the tax (at 2 1/4 cents per pound on tires) by the Revenue Act of 1932. Congress recognized that the very heavy weight of laminated tiresdisadvantaged this new small industry since the tax represented nearly 20% of the retail cost of thetire. In an effort to stimulate job creation, Congress passed the Surface TransportationAssistance Act of 1982. in the American Jobs CreationAct of 2004. The revenue effect was scored as being negligible. Also included inthis legislation is a requirement that the Internal Revenue Service collect revenuedata for each class of taxable tire beginning January 1, 2006. The Senate's version of the bill adds $11.2billion in additional revenues all of which is fully offset. It is argued that thisadditional revenue is needed so that all states will receive as much in federal highwayaid as they pay in federal gasoline excise taxes. funding authorization level ($283.9 billion oversix years) is not met. There are two main reasons why the tax is imposed upon the weight or loadcapacity rather than the sales price of tires. At the time of World War II, there simplywere no substitutes for rubber and no domestic rubber supply. Since rubber was anecessary commodity for the war effort, the imposition of this excise tax was used as a means to discourage domestic consumption. As such, the person using morerubber -- and heavier tires -- would shoulder a heavier tax burden than those personsconserving the valuable commodity. individuals because individuals withlower incomes tend to spend a larger portion of their income on these goods. Today, revenues from the excise tax on tires provide less than 2% of the Highway Trust Fund receipts.
