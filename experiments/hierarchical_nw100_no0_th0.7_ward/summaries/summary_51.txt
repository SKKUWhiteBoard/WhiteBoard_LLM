than 400 training courses offered by the Office of Human Resources Management in 2005. Since 2004, OIOS has subscribed to IIA’s online training service that offers more than 100 courses applicable to auditors. The Office does not formally require staff training, nor does it systematically track training to provide reasonable assurance that all staff are maintaining and acquiring professional skills. OI OS policy manuals list no minimum training requirement, although they gather some information on their use of training funds for their annual training report. to the UN Office of Human Resources Management, they do not maintain an office wide database to systematically track all training taken by their staff. In our April 2006 report on OIOS, we also recommended that the Secretary of State and the Permanent Representative of the United States to the UN work with member states to support OI OS’s efforts to more closely adhere to international auditing standards. In commenting on the official draft of that report, OIos and State agreed with our overall conclusions and recommendations. OIOS’s authority spans all UN activities under the Secretary-General. OIOS derives its funding from (1) regular budget resources, which are funds from assessed contributions from member states. UN personnel records show that OIos staff took a total of more than $1 million in fees and expenses in 2004 and 2005. The UN does not formally require or systematically track staff training to provide reasonable assurance that all staff are maintaining and acquiring professional skills, the report says. not have adequate resources, they do not have a mechanism in place to determine appropriate staffing levels to help justify budget requests, except for peacekeeping oversight services. For peacekeeping audit services, OIOS does have a metric—endorsed by the General Assembly—that provides one professional auditor for every $100 million in the annual peacekeeping budget. For the CMP, OiOS reported that it has been difficult to support staff increases in oversight areas that lack a comparable metric, according to officials. OIOS has no authority to enforce payment for services rendered, officials say. There is no appeal process, no supporting administrative structure, and no adverse impact on an agency that does not pay or pays only a portion of the bill. In our April 2006 report concerning OIOS, we recommended that the Secretary of State and the Permanent Representative of the United States to the UN work with member states to support budgetary independence for OIos. In commenting on the official draft of that report, OI OS said it agreed with our findings and recommendation. GAO found that current UN financial regulations and rules are very restrictive, severely limiting OIOS’s ability to respond to changing circumstances. GAO: State fully agreed with our findings that UN member states need to ensure that OiOS has budgetary independence. State: State does not believe that multiple funding sources have impeded OI OS’S budgetary flexibility. OIos formally adopted the GAO‘s recommendations. Oios stated that observations made in our report were consistent with OI SOS’’�s internal assessments and external peer reviews. dependent on UN funds and programs and other UN entities for resources, access, and reimbursement for the services it provides. OIOS negotiates the terms of work and payment for services with the manager of the program it intends to examine, and heads of these entities have the right to deny funding for oversight work. By denying OIos funding, UN entities could avoid OI OS audits or investigations, says the report. The report was published by the International Institute of Social and Economic Research. and high-risk areas could potentially be excluded from timely examination. For example, allowing the heads of programs the right to deny funding to internal audit activities prevented OIOS from examining high- risk areas in the UN Oil for Food program, where billions of dollars were subsequently found to have been misused. In some cases, fund and program managers have disputed fees charged by OiOS for investigative services rendered. 40 percent of the $2 million billed by OIos after it completed its work is currently in dispute, and since 2001, less than half of the entities have paid. its multiple funding sources, OIOS locations worldwide, or its operating divisions to address changing priorities. In addition, the movement of staff positions or funds between regular and extrabudgetary resources is not allowed. For example, one section in the Internal Audit Division may have exhausted its regular budget travel funds, while another section may have travel funds available that are financed by extrab budgetary peacekeeping resources. It would breach UN financial regulations and rules if it moved resources between the two budgets. Since 1996, an increasing share of OIOSís total budget is comprised of extrabudgetary resources. The majority of OiOS’s staff (about 69 percent) is funded with extrabbudgetary resources, which increased due to audits and investigations of peacekeeping operations, including issues related to sexual exploitation and abuse. OIos is based in Washington, D.C., and has offices in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, DC. The organization is funded by a combination of its regular budget and its extrab budget, which has increased in nominal terms. states that cover normal, recurrent activities such as the core functions of the UN Secretariat and (2) extrabudgetary resources. OIOS audited some aspects of the Oil for Food program and identified hundreds of weaknesses and irregularities. But it lacked the resources and independence needed to audit the entire program, the authors say. The report was published by the International Institute for Social and Economic Research (IISER) on November 14.

The UN is vulnerable to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement due to weaknesses in existing oversight practices. The General Assembly mandate creating OIOS calls for it to be operationally independent. UN funding arrangements severely limit OIos’s ability to respond to changing circumstances and reallocate its resources among the Institute for Internal Auditors’ (IIA) international standards for the professional practice of internal auditing in 2002. Effective oversight demands reasonable budgetary independence, sufficient resources, and adherence to professional auditing standards. OIOS has adopted a risk management framework to link the office’s annual work plans to risk-based priorities, but it has not fully implemented this framework. As of April 2006, out of 25 entities that comprise major elements of its “oversight universe,” only three risk assessments had been completed. As a result, OIOS officials cannot currently provide reasonable assurance that the entities they choose to examine are those that pose the highest risk, says the report.to the UN work with member states to support OIos’S efforts to more closely adhere to international auditing standards. in their annual work plan during the planning phase so that, by 2008, at least 50 percent of their work is based on a systematic risk assessment. Although OIOS’s annual reports contain references to risks facing the UN organization, the reports do not provide an overall assessment of the status of these risks or the consequence to the organization if the risks are not addressed. For instance, in February 2005, the Independent Inquiry Committee reported that many of the Oil for Food program's deficiencies were not described in the annual reports submitted to the UN. OIOS does not have an annual report to assess risks and controls. The General Assembly would have to determine the appropriate vehicle for such a new reporting requirement. The official agreed that OIOS should communicate to senior management on areas where the office has not been able to examine significant risk and control issues. The office has stated that the office does have the ability to assess risk and controls, but that such an assessment does not belong in the annual report in its current form, which focuses largely on the activities of the office. UN needs to establish an independent bid protest process for suspected wrongdoing. The number of contracts reviewed by the committee has increased by almost 60 percent since 2003. The committee’s chairman and members told us that the committee does not have the resources to keep up with its expanding workload. They said that the UN needs to set up an independent third-party evaluation as well as arbitration, due process, and formal resolution for all reports. It also needs to create an independent body to investigate allegations of wrongdoing. The committee is charged with evaluating proposed contracts worth more than $200,000. Concerns regarding the committee’s structure and workload have led UN auditors to conclude that the committee cannot properly review contract proposals. It may thus recommend contracts for approval that are inappropriate and have not met the committee's requirements, the report said. The committee is responsible for advising the Department of Management as to whether the contracts are in accordance with UN Financial Regulations and Rules and other UN policies. The report was published on Wednesday. The UN has not established an independent process to consider vendor protests. Such a process would provide reasonable assurance that vendors are treated fairly when bidding. It would also help alert senior UN management to situations involving questions about UN compliance. The General Assembly endorsed the principle of independent bid protests in 1994 when it recommended for adoption by member states a model procurement law drafted by the UN Commission on International Trade Law. The UN’s lack of an independent bid protest process limits the transparency of its procurement process by not providing a means for a vendor to protest. We have identified problems affecting the UN’s bid protest process, headquarters contract review committee, vender rosters, procurement workforce, ethics guidance for procurement personnel, and procurement manual. In our April 2006 report on UN procurement, we recommended that the Secretary of State and the Permanent Representative of the United States to the UN work with member states to encourage the UN over the past 2 years. A Procurement Service official who helped revise the manual in 2004 stated that the procurement service has been unable to allocate resources needed to update the manual since that time. The UN Procurement Service directs its vendors to file protests to the chief and then to his or her immediate supervisor. If handled through an independent process, vendor complaints could alert senior UN officials and UN auditors to the failure of UN procurement staff to comply with stated procedures. The U.N. hired a consultant to evaluate the internal controls of its procurement operations. One of the consultant’s conclusions was that the internal control of the procurement operations was inadequate. The consultant also found that the UN had not followed its own procurement procedures properly. procurement spending has more than tripled to keep pace with a rapidly growing peacekeeping program. The UN Department of Management, through its 70-person UN Procurement Service, is ultimately responsible for developing UN procurement policies. Because the UN is a multilateral institution, our oversight authority does not directly extend to the UN, but instead extends through the United States’ membership in the organization. In recognition of this factor, we conduct UN-related work only in response to specific requests from committees with jurisdiction over UN matters. steps to improve UN procurement. The Department of State stated that it welcomed our report and endorsed its recommendations. The UN did not provide us with written comments. To assess internal controls in the UN procurement process, we used an internal control framework that is widely accepted in the international audit community. We assessed the UN’s control environment for procurement, as well as its control activities, risk assessment process, procurement information processes, and monitoring systems. In doing so, we reviewed documents and information prepared by the UN Board of Auditors. If implemented, the CMP will be a large and unique endeavor for the UN. Effective internal oversight and management of the procurement process will be necessary for the successful completion of the project. Recent UN scandals, particularly in the Oil for Food program, demonstrate oversight launched as a result of the World Summit in the fall of 2005. The degree to which the UN and OIOS embrace international auditing standards and practices will demonstrate their commitment to addressing the monumental management and oversight tasks that lie ahead. could impact implementation of the CMP. Long-standing weaknesses in the UN’s procurement office have left UN procurement funds highly vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse. Many of these weaknesses have been identified and documented by outside experts and the UN's own auditors for more than a decade. Sustained leadership at the UN will be needed to correct these weaknesses. This concludes my testimony. I would be pleased to take your questions. Should you have any questions about this testimony, please contact me at (202) 512-9601 or melitot@gao.gov. to provide full and effective oversight of this large, costly, and complex UN effort. As the program was implemented, the Oil for Food program was further weakened by inadequate attention to internal controls. In addition to oversight, an effective procurement process is one of the keys to success for any large scale construction project. For more than a decade, experts have called on the UN to correct serious weaknesses in its procurement process. The UN procurement process has been under increasing stress in recent years as a result. The UN does not consistently implement its process for helping to ensure that it is conducting business with qualified vendors. As a result, the UN may be vulnerable to favoring certain vendors or dealing with unqualified vendors. In 1994, a high-level group of international procurement experts concluded that the UN’s vendor roster was outdated, inaccurate, and inconsistent across all locations. The UN has not demonstrated a commitment to improving its professional procurement staff through training, OIOS said in a recent report. UN has not established a career path for professional advancement for procurement staff. UN has not updated its procurement manual since January 2004 to reflect current UN procurement policy. In June 2005, a UN consultant recommended that the UN develop separate guidelines in the manual for the planning and execution of construction projects. These guidelines could be useful in planning and executing CMP procurement. The UN has been considering the development of specific ethics guidance for procurement officers for almost a decade, in response to General Assembly directives dating back to 1998. The UN has relied disproportionately on the actions of its staff to safeguard its resources. Recent studies indicate that Procurement Service staff lack knowledge of UN procurement policies. Most procurement staff lack professional certifications attesting to their procurement education, training, and experience. The UN has not established requirements for procurement staff to obtain continuous training, resulting in inconsistent levels of training across the procurement workforce. Furthermore, UN staff have not been trained in a career development path, and other key human capital practices critical to attracting, developing and retaining a qualified professional workforce. main breaker for electrical power to the top floors of the Secretariat building failed, causing it to fuse to the electrical panel. This failure could have resulted in a major fire. As host country, the United States financed construction of the original complex by providing the UN with a no-interest loan. The rest of the complex was built between 1960 and 1982 and funded through the UN’s regular budget or private donations. In December 2002, the General Assembly endorsed the CMP to renovate the UN headquarters complex. May 2003, we reported that the resulting renovation planning was reasonable, but that additional management controls and oversight were needed. In April 2006, the UN appropriated $23.5 million to finance the renovation’s preconstruction phase and committed $77 million to construction of temporary conference space and supplementary office space rental. The General Assembly has not yet decided whether to approve implementation of the CMP. In a February 2003 resolution, the General Assembly stressed the importance of oversight in implementing the C MP. The UN headquarters buildings in New York City are in need of renovation. Over the last 50 years there have been no major renovations or upgrades to the buildings or their systems. In September 2005, the headquarters complex was shut down and the staff sent home because a fire broke out in one of the buildings. The UN headquarters complex lacks fire sprinklers, has a deteriorating window structure, and is vulnerable to catastrophic electrical failures. The buildings do not meet current safety, fire and building codes and does not meet UN technology or security requirements.
