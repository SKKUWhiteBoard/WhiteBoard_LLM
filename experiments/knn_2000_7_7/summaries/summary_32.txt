Professor: Imagine take a magnet, a little, tiny bar magnet. If you have a gradient of a magnetic field, then one end a dipole-- one end of your magnet-- can feel a stronger effective torque then the other guy. So, you can get a net force. And that force is going to be proportional to how big your magnet is. And if the force is proportional to the strength ofyour magnet, then how far-- if you send this magnet through a region, it'll get deflected in one direction or the other.
