Coded imaging is a form of a co-design between how you capture the image and how you process the image. In the Fourier domain, convolution in the image domain is multiplication in the standard Fourier transform. If you have a sharp photo and a blurred photo, you can basically represent that as asharp photo. The concept of a position or superposition applies to all three types, shadows- or refraction- or reflection-based techniques. It's a way to recover the sharp detail afterwards in software. Raskar: Compressed sensing or compressed imaging comes up when you want to take something that is much higher resolution but recover it in a compressed way. He says a group at Rice University has been able to measure the z-dimension down to about 10 nanometers. Raskar says the idea is to take one single photo and turn it on and off to get a million-pixel image, which can then be used to reconstruct neuronal structures in three-dimensional form. The concept is mathematically easy to explain, he says. which is how to write a paper and wishlist for photography.
