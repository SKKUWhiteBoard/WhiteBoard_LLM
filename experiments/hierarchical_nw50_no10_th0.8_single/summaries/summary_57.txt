Private sector participation and investment in transit is not new. In the 1800s, the private sector played a central role in financing early transportation infrastructure development in the United States. Conventional transit projects generally follow a “design-bid-build” approach. The federal government has progressively relaxed restrictions on private participation in highway and transit projects serving public objectives. Much of the federal government’s share of new capital investment in mass transportation has come through the New Starts program. Through the New starts program, FTA identifies and recommends new fixed-guideway transit projects.
