In this lecture, we introduce and develop the concept of independence between events. If I tell you that a certain event A has occurred, this will generally change the probability of some other event B. In such a case, we say that events A and B are independent. We will then proceed to define the independence of a collection of more than two events. Finally, we will close with an application in reliability analysis and with a nice puzzle that will serve as a word of caution about putting together such a collection. probabilistic models. Probabilism models are models based on a set of assumptions about the future of the economy. The models are based on the assumption that the economy will continue to grow in the future. They can be used to make predictions about future growth. For more information, visit: http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/29/30/science/features/top-10-most-futile-probabilities-in-the-world/story/story.html.
