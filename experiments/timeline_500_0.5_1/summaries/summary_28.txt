A random variable is a number that's produced by a random process. The number of faulty pixels in a monitor is also produced from an unpredictable randomness. The event that C equals 1, that's an event that-- it's a set of outcomes where the count is 1 and it has a certain probability. There are 3 possible outcomes among the 8 outcomes of heads and tails with 3 coins. The probability that C greater than or equal to 1 is 7/8. And when the outcome is translated into a real number that you think of as being produced as a random variable, it's what the random variable does. hold in circumstances where pairwise does hold. So this is good to know. We'll be making use of it in an application later when we look at sampling and the law of large numbers. Back to Mail Online home.back to the page you came from.
