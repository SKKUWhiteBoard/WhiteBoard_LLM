Last time, we covered Fourier series and the Fourier transform. Today, we're going to talk about the convolution theorem, noise and filtering Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem and spectral estimation. Next, we'll move on to spectrograms and an important idea of windowing and tapering, time bandwidth product, and some more advanced filtering methods. And we'll end with a look at a square wave that we've been talking about, the square wave is symmetric or even.
