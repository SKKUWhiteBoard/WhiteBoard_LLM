Expectations play a big role in the decision of all economic actors. Milton Friedman called it the permanent income theory of consumption. You don't want to be moving consumption up and down like crazy. Once you realize, more or less, what you'll get on average, then you should-- consumption should be related to that concept. We will develop a life-cycle theory of Consumption, which says, look, even at the level of an individual, the day-to-day income is not really what determines consumption.
