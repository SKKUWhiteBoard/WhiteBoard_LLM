Commercialization of air navigation services was intended to relieve the government of a fiscal responsibility. According to ICAO, the government should still regulate the safety of the ANSPâ€™s operations. The ANSP should be encouraged to be as competitive, efficient, and cost-effective as any other commercial business. The five commercialized ANSPs are affiliated with one or more international aviation-related organizations. All five ANSPS are also members of the Civil Air Navigation Services Organization (CANSO)
