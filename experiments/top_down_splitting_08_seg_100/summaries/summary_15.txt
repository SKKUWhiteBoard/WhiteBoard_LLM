Preventive health care can extend lives and promote well-being among our nation’s seniors. Medicare now covers a number of preventive services, including immunizations, such as hepatitis B and influenza. Not all beneficiaries, however, avail themselves of covered preventive services. Some beneficiaries may simply choose not to use these services, but others may be unaware that the services are available or covered by Medicare.. For some beneficiaries, certain services may not be warranted or may be of limited value. Appropriate preventive care depends on an individual's age and particular health risks. A proposed CMS demonstration, currently in design, will explore another preventive care delivery option and examine the value of linking beneficiaries to needed follow-up services. Primary care physicians typically cannot provide services such as mammography screenings for breast cancer or colonoscopies for colon cancer. It is uncertain whether a one-time or periodic examination would be an effective way to improve beneficiaries’ health, the authors say. The design phase had not been finalized as of last week and required approval from HHS and the Office of Management and Budget.
