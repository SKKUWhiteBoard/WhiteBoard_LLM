this isn't so practical. Tangent parabola, quite practical. Higher order terms, less-- much less practical. But the formula is beautiful because you see the pattern, that's really what mathematics is about. They all fit that pattern and when you add up all the terms, if you have a nice function, then the approximation becomes perfect and you would have equality. And those are the best functions of mathematics and exponential is of course one of them. OK that's calculus. Well, part of calculus. GILBERT STRANG: Differential equations is the big application of calculus. He says you really do need to know basic derivatives. The derivative of e to the x, he says, solves the equation dy dt equals y plus q of t. Strang: You can create the derivatives of an enormous array of functions using the key rules. The product rule fg prime plus gf prime. The quotient rule. The chain rule. And above all, the derivative of this-- of that chain of functions, that composite function.
