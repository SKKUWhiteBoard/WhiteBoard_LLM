The most commonly funded projects were in the area of biology (423 projects), followed by treatment and interventions (253 projects), and causes (159 projects) NIH funded a majority of the autism research projects in five of the seven research areas. Five agencies that funded non-research autism-related activities from fiscal years 2008 through 2011 funded activities that were not duplicative. CDC is the only agency funding an awareness campaign on autism and other developmental disabilities. The IACC and federal agencies may have missed opportunities to coordinate federal autism activities and reduce the risk of duplication. The CAA requires the IACC to coordinate HHS autism activities and monitor federal autism activities. OARC officials stated that the prevention of duplication among individual projects in agency portfolios is not specified in the CAA as one of IACCâ€™s statutory responsibilities. HHS did not concur with our recommendation that such an analysis by the I ACC to identify duplication would not likely provide the detail needed to determine actual duplication. We agree that further analysis would be needed to identify actual duplication of effort and resources.
