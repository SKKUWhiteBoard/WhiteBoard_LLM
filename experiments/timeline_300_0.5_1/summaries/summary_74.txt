This lesson will first dive into some signal Theory and then move on into things that we're more familiar with things like deconvolutions and using Transformers for next note prediction. The first thing we want to talk about is how can we sample and quantize a continuous time signal. We then go into some geometric signal Theory with Transformers and finally how how we can kind of generate sounds using these. The next thing we're going to kind oftalk about is changing forms. We'll talk about the SARS ADC algorithm and how it's used to convert digital signals to analog. is less than double of the highest frequency present aliasing will happen. This asserts that you need at least two samples per period. aliasing is the byproduct of poor sampling. A lower wave resolution will result in a modified output signal as compared to the original input that we're trying to process. There's a lot of literature about um aliasing effects including spatial illnessing. The aliasing phenomenon is incredibly interesting this happens both visually and auditorily. It's a very prevalent problem in any problem.
