In the colonial era, most American women of European descent lived lives much like those of their European counterparts: They were legally and socially subservient to men. Lower and working class women were actually more equal to men of their own classes, but only because they were, like, equally poor. In the 19th century, the movement for women’s rights was the most visible manifestation of woman’S suffrage, raised most eloquently at the Seneca Falls Convention of 1848. domesticity decreed that a woman’s place was in the home, so rather than making stuff, the job of women was to enable their husbands to make stuff. “Woman is to win everything by peace and love; by making herself so much respected, esteemed and loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart,” said Catharine Stowe, sister of Harriet Beecher Stowe. But it wasn’t just men who bought into the Cult of Domesticity. The idea of true equality between men and women was so radical that almost no one embraced it. women found work in that most disreputable of fields, teaching, but the cult of domesticity held that a respectable middle class woman should stay at home. Many of the most famous advocates for legally prohibiting the sale of alcohol in the US were women. Many women were also important contributors to the anti-slavery movement, although they tended to have more subordinate roles. Like, abolitionist Maria Stewart was the first African American woman to lecture to mixed male and female audiences. Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote the terrible but very important Harriet Stowe.
