In the 1999-2000 academic year, an estimated 7.1 million adults were enrolled as undergraduates in the nationâ€™s postsecondary institutions. About three- quarters of these adult undergraduates were between the ages of 24 to 40, while about one-quarter were 41 or older. Adult students received about $3.3 billion in grant assistance and $8.5 billion in loan assistance from programs authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. To receive federal financial aid, students must meet several eligibility requirements, including being enrolled aid.
