MIT OpenCourseWare is a free, online education platform. MIT OpenCourse Ware is available in English and French. The weekly Newsquiz tests students' knowledge of MIT courses. This week's quiz includes questions about the i3, Mr. Sticky, and the smart car. The winner will receive a prize for their best knowledge of an MIT course in English or French.

If this was like a streetcar, don't you think it would apply to that as well? So I think the fact that it's a personal vehicle, I think it's important. So the key in this is, describe the concept using few words precisely, but to set it apart from neighboring concepts. What about Rolex Center? It's a single-layer building with multiple straw used as a library for people to meet and study. built. The first thing you do is understand where is the value-- the stakeholders and the stakeholder analysis and the requirements definition. And then you interpret and incorporate some of the needs into goals, which become requirements. And so the goals then are an instrument of the primary delivery value delivering process, which is your value proposition. To then actually deliver that value you need to design the product, the product system, and understand the operand, the thing that is being operated on or transformed by the primary value delivery process. EPFL's Olivier De WECK talks about how to reduce food spoilage rate. He says the key is to think in an abstract way and then pick a specific concept. He explains how bears use fat to transform it into fat and store it in their bodies. The process is similar to conserving grapes, beer and wine, he says. The concept was developed by EPFL's design and creativity unit. The project is now being developed by a company in the UK, and is expected to be completed by the end of 2014. A cooler has the chilling function, and then the sub-functions when we zoom in are holding the food, exchanging the heat between the food and the environment, reducing the heat load, interfacing, connecting, powering, regulating the temperature, et cetera. And then on the form side, the cooler itself is very simple structurally. And you can go very detailed here, even for something very simple like a cooler. One question and then we'll talk about the refrigerator and how it's different in a minute. is concept generation. So take the requirements and think creatively about how these requirements could be fulfilled. And then once you have several concepts, you've got to select among them, which we'll talk about next week. It's about starting with the operand. What is the thing that the beneficiary, the stakeholder cares about, and how do we transform that? Concept then elaborate these into architectures that have form function and structural complexity. And the goodness of an architecture is really a pretty complex concept. System design and management program is a full-year program. It's essentially focused on decomposition, which is an important part of architecting. So let me talk about methods and tools for concept generation. So what are different ways of stimulating or organizing creativity? And what I'm showing you here is-- that's essentially a mind map of how to think about the creativity space. And then we have this whole area here, which I'm going to mention, but we're not going to do as part of the class. There's got to be a driving question for the brainstorming session. There's an ideal group size, and it says 5 to 10 here, but I should probably revise this to be-- what do you think? 7 plus minus 2. The idea is to produce a large amount of ideas and then at some point, maybe 30 to 60 minutes, Brainstorming session that last four hours is probably really good and then the rest is kind of shot and there's not a lot of new ideas coming. Leonardo was a head of his time in many ways. So he's really been identified as an exceptional individual. How to Think Like Leonardo, Seven Steps to Genius, is a book on creativity. The seven da Vincian principles of creativity are here in Italian. They include curiosita, lifelong quest for learning. Dimostratzione, testing your knowledge through experience, trying things out. Sensazione, continual refinement of the senses. Mastering ambiguity, paradox, uncertainty. Arte/Scienza is the whole brain thinking, left-right brain. Corporalita, balance of body and mind. or an architecture. So the key decisions are the rows. There are factors in the rows, and then for each row you think about what are the number of possible alternatives for doing this. And then you enumerate all possible combinations. And the big challenge with this, of course, is if you have many factors, you could generate many infeasible architectures. Not all these combinations are actually feasible. So that's architecture enumeration, and there's different ways of doing this at different layers of abstraction. A3 assignment A3 asks students to come up with new ways of brainstorming. Students must use mind maps, morphological matrices, and architecture enumeration. The assignment is due in two weeks and will be graded on a scale of 1-10. The final assignment will be given to students at the end of the month and the results will be published in the next few days. For more information on the assignment, visit the assignment website. It is open to students from all over the world and can be downloaded from the assignment site.
