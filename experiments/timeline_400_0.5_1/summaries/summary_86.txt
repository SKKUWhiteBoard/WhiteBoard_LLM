In automotive design Dynamics plays a very important part because it's not rigid body Dynamics it's a bunch of rigid bodies with springs the Springs are called starts with an S suspens suspensions right and there's a trade-off between how comfortable the ride is and how tightly the car handles. In Dynamics there two sides to it one is how will its various degrees of freedom behave over time if you you know stretch it and let it go and it goes twang you know boing right and you want to figure out how it goes in time that that's analysis. call this Theta the initial length is L one and the initial velocity is we'll call it a scalar because this is how I'm defining the problem of V1 when we actually solve it we might have to define a vector okay. As the thing's going around this person is going to pull the string down and as it kind of goes around it's going to spiral in and end up it's a new length L2 and the question is what is V2 going to be okay. would have to do one of two things I would have had to either calculate this term or calculate or make you know make my frame attach it to the truck. I've just done it in a very precise way okay so in the end there's no surprise the whole point is to show you they could be surprises but be careful any questions about this all right snap quiz in the next 3 minutes I want you to calculate for me the final velocity literally 3 minutes because I have toDo the dumbbell problem. Non-standard coordinates do I need to describe the configuration of this dumbbell let me make a proposal to you what if I said let's label them first of all let's call this particle o this point O. Let's call uh this guy P by the way I didn't give you the masses right but let's give them different masses M1 Q M2 and I will state Here length I don't want to mess up the diagram isal to 2 R so here's my proposal for a set of generalized coordinates I could use X and Y for particle P1 and particle Q is that reasonable it's perfectly reasonable.
