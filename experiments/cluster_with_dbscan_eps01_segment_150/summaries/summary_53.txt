and optics, upon the principle of relative movement." We now know this was wrong, but scientific process happens in scientific environment. And I started this class by explaining that one needs to be open minded to learn and to study and to grow scientifically. And one has to question the assumptions, understand the assumptions when then go into measurements. So this is the first part of this chapter where we talk about tests. We will have a discussion of implications of special relativity as we move on from here. Markus Klute: We're starting a new chapter in which we look at tests and implications of special relativity. One experimental test is stellar aberration, which we discussed can be explained by special relativity and by velocity addition. In all of this experimentation and experimental verification, it's important to understand the importance of uncertainties in the scientific process overall, Klute says. He says one needs to be open minded and scientifically open minded to study and grow to the question of whether or not Einstein's theory is correct.
