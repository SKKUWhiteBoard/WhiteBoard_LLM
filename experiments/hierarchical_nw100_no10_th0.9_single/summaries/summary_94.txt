An ISP’s traffic connects to a backbone Internet backbone networks. Unlike telecommunications services, the provision of Internet backbone service is not regulated. Two types of facilities are used for the exchange of data traffic by interconnected Internet backbone providers.

In a “peering” relationship, backbone providers exchange traffic destined for each other without the imposition of a fee.
