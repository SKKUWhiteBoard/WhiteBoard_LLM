Summary:
The two federal material support statutes have been at the heart of the Justice Department's terrorist prosecution efforts. They largely share a common definition of the term "material support" Since their inception in the mid-1990s, Congress has periodically expanded and sought to clarify the scope of Sections 2339A and 2339B. Allowing an individual to supply funds, goods, or services to an organization, or to any of its subgroups, helps defray the costs to the terrorist organization of running the ostensibly legitimate activities. "Whoever" usually means any legal entity or individual. Section 2339A outlaws: (1) whoever (2) [knowingly] (3)(a) attempts to, (b) conspires to, or (c) actually (4) provides material support or resources. The Dictionary Act declares that "person" and "whoever" include corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals. "Whoever" knows or intends that they be used in preparation for, or in carrying out, an offense identified as a federal crime of terrorism. At common law, every crime consisted of two essentials, one mental ( mens rea ) and the other physical ( actus reus ). Thereafter, legislative bodies, Congress included, created criminal offenses which had no mental component. This occurred most often for regulatory, "public welfare" misconduct, misconduct that did not constitute a common law crime. Federal law now generally holds that corporations are criminally liable for crimes committed by their officers, employees, or agents within the scope of their employment and for the benefit of the corporation. Supreme Court has stopped short of equating felony status with the intent to require a mens rea component. The word "provide" ordinarily means "to supply something for sustenance or support" Section 2339A condemns both providing material support and concealing "the nature, location, source, or ownership" The concealing prong provision seems designed to reach the middle men or conduits between terrorists and their supporters.. The predicate offense consists of several offenses, such as bombing a federal building or murdering a federal official. 18 U.S.C. Section 2339A outlaws attempts as well as conspiracies to violate its proscriptions. If the attempt is successful, the offender cannot be prosecuted or punished for both the completed offense and the attempt to commit it. Attempt has two elements: (1) an intent to commit the underlying offense; and (2) some substantial step towards its completion. Mere preparation is not enough. "To constitute a substantial step, the attempt must be completed" a defendant's actions must cross the line between preparation and attempt. It is no defense that, unbeknownst to the defendant, commission of the underlying offense was impossible, as for example because he was dealing with government undercover agents. An attempt to provide material support in violation of Section 2339A and actually providing such assistance are punished the same: imprisonment for not more than 15 years (for any term of years or life, if death results from theCommission of the offense) The government must prove that the crime will take place unless interrupted by independent circumstances. a conspiracy; (2) that the objective thereof was to provide support or resources; and (3) that he then knew and intended that such support would be used in preparation for, or in carrying of [a predicate offense] No First Amendment violation occurs when the government introduces at trial evidence of the defendant's conspiratorial statements. "Forming an agreement to engage in criminal activities – in contrast with simply talking about religious or political beliefs – is not [First Amendment] protected speech," the ruling says.  conspirators may be punished for both conspiracy and for actually providing material support should their scheme succeed. Unlike conspiracy, liability under Section 2 only attaches if someone else commits the substantive offense. Convictions carry a sentence of imprisonment for not more than 15 years (for any period of years or for life if death results from commission of the offense) The Sentence Guidelines influence the sentence actually imposed below the statutory maximum. Either the defendant or the government or both, may seek appellate court review of the sentence imposed. The Sentencing Guidelines treat Section 2339A convictions as if they were convictions for aiding and abetting and for being an accessory after the fact. A federal crime of terrorism is one "calculated to influence or affect the conduct of [a] government by intimidation or coercion, or to retaliate against government conduct" The standard "does not focus on the defendant but on his 'offense,' asking whether it was calculated, i.e. planned – for whatever reason or motive – to achieve the stated object" Section 2339A of the U.S. Constitution applies to crimes with extraterritorial application. The Supreme Court in RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European Community declared: "Absent clearly expressed congressional intent to the contrary, federal laws will be construed to have only domestic application" The law provides as a general rule that conspiracy to commit an offense may be tried wherever an act in furtherance of the conspiracy occurs. The law's application abroad extends at least as far as the extraterritional application of its predicate offenses. abroad may be tried where the accused is first brought into the United States. Venue is also proper when the accused aided and abetted the commission of a completed offense. The courts have concluded that the violations of Section 2339A or Section 2 339B may constitute "acts of international terrorism" for purposes ofSection 2333. Federal law now generally holds that corporations are criminally liable for crimes committed by their officers, employees, or agents within the scope of their employment and for the benefit of the corporation. Section 2339B has no explicit definition of the word "provide" Nothing in the context indicates Congress intended to attach any special meaning to the word. At least two lower federal courts concluded that the word should be accorded its ordinary dictionary meaning. With some additions, the section uses the definition found in Section 2339A(b) and thus covers "any property, tangible or intangible, or service" The material support excludes medicine and religious materials, but includes: currency or monetary instruments or financial securities. Congress adjusted some of the definitions in the wake of First Amendment overbreadth and due process vagueness challenges that the Supreme Court ultimately addressed. The Humanitarian Law Project and other groups had argued that Section 2339B's prohibitions against providing "personnel" or "training" were unconstitutionally vague and might extend to things like advocating the organizations' interests before the U.N. Commission on Human Rights. In H older v. H umanitarian Law project , the Supreme court concluded that Section2339B, as applied, was not unconst Constitutionally vague. Chief Justice Roberts: Due process bars enforcement of a vague criminal statute. A statute is impermissibly vague when "it fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or is so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory enforcement" Section 2339B is clearly applicable to the conduct at issue, it is to no avail that its application may be unclear under other circumstances, Chief Justice Roberts said. The Supreme Court ruled 5-2 that the lower court had interwoven First Amendment overbreadth into its vagueness analysis. not unconstitutionally vague as applied to the type of support at issue – coordinated advocacy on behalf of a terrorist organization. As for free speech, the Chief Justice concluded that Congress may outlaw material support to aterrorist organization in the form of speech of the type at issue without offending the First Amendment. The government has a compelling interest in the suppression of terrorism. Training and coordinated support frees resources to service illicit activities; lends legitimacy to the organization; and may strain diplomatic relations with countries against whom the organization's terrorist activities may be directed. of any conveyance (including an aircraft, vessel, or vehicle) (II) The seizing or detaining, and threatening to kill, injure, or continue to detain, another individual in order to compel a third person to do or abstain from doing any act. (III) A violent attack upon an internationally protected person (as defined in Section 1116(b)(4) of Title 18) or upon the liberty of such a person. (IV) An assassination. (V) The use of any – (a) biological agent, chemical agent, or nuclear weapon or device, or (b) explosive, firearm, or other weapon or dangerous device. Section 2339B outlaws both attempts and conspiracies to violate its substantive provisions. An attempt is the unfulfilled commission of an underlying offense. If the attempt is successful, the offender cannot be prosecuted or punished for both the completed offense and the attempt to commit it. It is no defense that, unbeknownst to the defendant, commission of the underlying offense was impossible, as for example because he was dealing with government undercover agents rather than agents of a foreign terrorist organization. A defendant's actions must cross the line between preparation and attempt by unequivocally demonstrating that the crime will take place unless interrupted by independent circumstances.  conspirators may be punished for both conspiracy and for actually providing material support should their scheme succeed. Conviction for a violation of Section 2339B is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years (for any period of years or for life if death results from commission of the offense) The Sentencing Guidelines assign a base offense level of 26 which translates, without more, to a sentencing range of 63 to 78 months imprisonment for offenders with a virtually pristine criminal record. Section 3A1.4 raises the offense level to 32, criminal history category VI that translates to a sentence of 210 to 262 months imprisonment. Section 2339B has both a descriptive and a general statement of extraterritorial jurisdiction. The general statement has been part of the section since its inception. At least one court seems to have reached a different conclusion from the general statement. The legislative history of the 2004 legislation provides no explanation of why the apparently overlapping statement was thought necessary. The inclusion of both suggests Congress may have intended extraterritory application in any situation that falls under either provision. The descriptive statement appeared in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The courts have concluded that the violations of Section 2339A or Section 2 339B may constitute "acts of international terrorism" The courts have stated that "[f]or non-citizens acting entirely abroad, a [due-process-required] jurisdictional nexus exists when the aim of that activity is to cause harm inside the United States or to U.S. citizens or interests" Section 2333 authorizes the Attorney General or the Secretary of the Treasury to bring a civil suit in district court to enjoin violation of the section.

Summary:
The Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing program offers low-interest loans. Congress has authorized $35 billion in loan a uthority for the program, but freight railroads have been unenthusiastic. Since 2000, RRIF has made 37 loans to 29 operators for a total of $5.4 billion. About 85% of the RRIF program's nominal loan amount has gone to government-controlled entities for passenger rail projects rather than to freight operators, says John Sutter. The railroad industry has changed significantly since Congress created a forerunner of RRIF in 1976. Congress significantly deregulated the railroad industry, making it easier for carriers to consolidate and to shed less profitable routes. Since that time, mergers have reduced a large number of regional railroads to a handful of companies that operate across many states. Deregulation allowed the large railroads. to focus their construction and maintenance efforts on heavily trafficked main lines and to stop service on. other lines. Some lightly used trackage was sold to smaller operators. These smaller railroads are collectively known as short line railroads. They are classified by the Federal Railroad Administration as Class II and Class III carriers. Their revenues are smaller, their lines of business typically are more limited than those of the Class I railroads, and their creditworthiness generally is lower. However, nearly half of the short-line railroads in the U.S. are Class I freight railroads and are able to finance improvements out of their revenues. nation's short line railroads have come under the control of 27 holding companies, potentially offering them easier access to private financing. Amtrak operates at a loss and relies on federal grants appropriated annually to continue operations. There is an estimated backlog of $38 billion in capital investment needed to restore the aging NEC infrastructure to a state of good repair. The Northeast Corridor is a rail line running from Washington, DC, through New York City to Boston. This line also is used heavily by commuter rail operations and also hosts freight service. Congress created the RRIF program in 1998 and revised it in 2005, 2008, and 2015. Eligible recipients of this assistance include railroads, state and local governments, government-sponsored corporations, and joint ventures that include at least one railroad. Projects eligible for RRIF assistance include acquiring, improving, and rehabilitating track, bridges, rail yards, buildings, and shops. RRIF loan applications are reviewed by the Build America Bureau, independent financial analysts hired by the Bureau, and DOT's Office of Credit and Finance. Public-sector entities have been intended for passenger rail projects. One $83.7 million loan to the Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority in 2012 was to support a freight project. FRA looked at the safety record of short line railroads, taking accident rates as a proxy for the condition of the infrastructure. Since the late 1980s, Class I railroads have moved from maximum car weights of 263,000 pounds to 286,.000 pounds. Track and bridges must be strengthened to handle these heavier loads. FRA estimated that the total investment needs of short line railroads would be $6.9 billion over the five-year period from 2013 to 2017. The survey results suggested an estimated gap of around $265 million per year between the available funding and the amount short lines felt was needed. The tax credit, first enacted in 2004, allows Class II and Class III railroads to reduce their taxes by 50% of the cost of track maintenance expenses incurred in a year, up to a limit established by multiplying track mileage by $3,500. Congress created a National Infrastructure Investment discretionary grant program in 2009. The program, popularly known as the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant program, made over $5 billion in grants through FY2017. Passenger and freight rail infrastructure projects are eligible uses of TIGER funds. Extending the credit has been introduced in the 115 th Congress ( H.R. 721, S. 407, and S. 2256). The program is very competitive, with several times as much funding requested each year as the $500. The TIFIA loan program, like the RRIF program, was authorized by Congress in 1998. As of the end of calendar year 2016, the program had assisted 56 projects with a total value of over $82 billion. Eligible projects include "rail projects involving the design and construction of intercity passenger rail facilities" and "intermodal freight transfer facilities" A number of states have established grant, loan, and tax benefit programs to help short line railroads finance infrastructure or equipment purchases. The primary competition for short line and regional railroads is the trucking industry. The degree of competition is affected by the extent of regulation and taxation on the rail and truck sectors. Trucks operate over publicly provided infrastructure (the highway network), whereas railroads are financially responsible for their own infrastructure. Congress could aid the short line railroads by, for example, increasing the amount of fuel tax paid by heavy trucks to a level commensurate with the damage they cause to the highway. The problem is exacerbated by exemptions Congress has provided to limits on truck weights. infrastructure and limiting exemptions to truck weight restrictions. Such changes also would benefit the Class I railroads. However, these changes could increase the cost of shipping goods by truck, adversely affecting trucking industry employment. Higher truck rates could affect rail shippers by giving railroads room to raise their own rates. The RRIF program has lent far less than the amount Congress authorized, particularly to private-sector borrowers, may indicate that freight railroads' ability to finance their investment needs without recourse to government support is greater than Congress believed. of Inspector General found that unclear program information resulted in incomplete loan applications that required FRA to work with applicants on completing the applications. Management of the program was subsequently transferred to the Build America Bureau. The Bureau published a guide to its credit programs (covering both RRIF and TIFIA) in January 2017. The bureau had five loan applications under review as of January 1, 2018; all were draft applications. The length of time since the draft applications had been submitted was 19 months, 14 months, 10 months, 8 months, and 7 months. Federal law requires that federal credit programs operate at no cost to the government. To cover the cost of administering the program (including evaluating loan applications), the RRIF program charges loan applicants a nonrefundable fee of up to 0.5% of the loan amount. Amtrak paid a 4.424% credit risk premium for its 2011 RRIF loan and 5.8% for its 2016 RRIF loans. If collateral of sufficient value is pledged, no credit risk premiums may be required. Prior to the FAST Act, DOT was required to refund the credit risk premium to borrowers after all the loans in their cohort of loans had been repaid. As of January 2018, DOT has not issued a formal definition of a "cohort of loans" As a result, while 21 RRIF loans have been repaid, DOT hasn't yet returned any credit risk premiums to their borrowers. DOT has reportedly decided that credit risk Premiums paid for loans made after enactment of the Fast Act will not be repaid. The RRIF program was created primarily to support freight rail service. A significant portion of RRIF assistance has gone to passenger rail service, especially since 2008. Amtrak, the federally owned intercity passenger railroad operator, has received more than half of all funds loaned by RRIF. Amtrak has repaid two of the loans; it does not have to begin repaying the 2016 loan until 2022. Lending to inter city passenger rail projects creates some unique challenges for RRIF, says the authors.

Summary:
The main purpose of a foreign counterintelligence investigation is to protect the U.S. government from the clandestine efforts of foreign powers and their agents. Many of the foreign powers’ clandestine efforts may involve a violation of U.s. criminal law, usually espionage or international terrorism, which falls within the federal law enforcement community’s mandate to investigate and prosecute. To provide a statutory framework for electronic surveillance conducted within the United States for foreign intelligence purposes, the Congress, in 1978, enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The FBI is the lead federal agency for protecting the United States from foreign intelligence, espionage, and terrorist threats. The FBI’s National Security and Counterterrorism Divisions are the units responsible for countering these threats. For intelligence and counterintelligence purposes, electronic surveillance and physical searches against foreign powers and agents of foreign powers in the U.S. are governed by FISA. FISA permits surveillance only when the purpose of the surveillance is to obtain foreign intelligence information. FISA also requires prior judicial approval by the FISA Court for surveillance and searches. between the FBI and the Criminal Division. We interviewed DOJ officials to determine the pertinent coordination policies, procedures, and processes in effect and their views on their effectiveness. To determine what actions DOJ has taken to address identified coordination problems, we reviewed certain legal requirements. A key factor impeding coordination of foreign counterintelligence investigations involving the use or anticipated use of the FISA surveillance and search tools has been the FBI’s concern about the possible consequences that could result if a federal court rule that the line between an intelligence and a criminal investigation had been crossed. Attorney General in July 1995 established policies and procedures for coordinating FBI foreign counterintelligence investigations with the Criminal Division. In January 2000, the Attorney General promulgated coordination procedures, which were in addition to the 1995 procedures. These procedures were promulgated to address problems identified during its review of the FBI’s investigation of the Los Alamos National Laboratory. According to DOJ officials, following the conviction of Aldrich Ames, OIPR believed that the close relationship between the FBI and Criminal Division had been near to crossing the line between intelligence and criminal investigations. OIPR, FBI, and Criminal Division officials have continued to strongly differ in their interpretation as to when the Criminal Division should be notified of FBI intelligence investigations. The issue revolved around the officials’ different perceptions of how restrictively the FISA Court might interpret Criminal Division notification or any subsequent advice the Division may provide. The Attorney General had not approved the memorandum, the working group’s recommendation to clarify language in the 1995 procedures was not implemented and, therefore, that issue remains. The language indicating when the Criminal Division is to be notified remained an issue. Some FBI officials continued to use the significant threshold and that there were still disagreements as to its meaning. No matter what impediments remain, the question exists as to how and how often has the lack of timely coordination adversely affected DOJ prosecutions, the authors say. They say it takes time to prepare for prosecution because it takes more than 2 or 3 days at the last minute to prepare an investigation. Such concerns indicate an oversight mechanism to ensure that an investigation is being informed of an investigation, they say. notification of the Criminal Division and the subsequent advice it provided. On the other hand, by not ensuring timely coordination on these cases, DOJ may place at risk the government’s ability to bring the strongest possible criminal prosecution. A decision is needed to balance and resolve these conflicting national security and law enforcement positions. Such actions could facilitate the coordination of DOJ's counterintelligence and prosecutorial functions, the authors say. They recommend that all FBI memorandums sent to OIPR contain a section devoted explicitly to identifying any possible federal criminal violation. The report notes that the timing of the information sharing has been an issue. notifications tended to occur near the end of the investigation, with the Criminal Division playing little or no role in decisions that could effect the success of an investigation. The Department wrote that all relevant Department components agree that information sharing is usually appropriate for all felonies. The Criminal Division has been the primary stumbling block to better coordination, the report says. The report says it is probably more accurate to divide the concept of coordination into an information- sharing component and an advice-giving component. potential subsequent prosecutions. Even with the later procedural changes to coordination, the Criminal Division still had concerns about the timeliness issue. As agreed with your office, unless you publicly release its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its issue date. We will also make copies available to others on request. If you should have any questions about this report, please call Daniel C. Harris or me on (202) 512-8777. See “Agency Comments and Our Evaluation” section. we did not review specific cases to try to identify instances of compliance or noncompliance with the coordination procedures. Given that since 1995, this issue has been studied by three high-level DOJ working groups and the Attorney General’s Review Team, we believe that DOJ is in the best position to address any changes to its procedures. The Department suggested that we emphasize to a greater extent throughout our report the sensitivity and complexity of the issues. We agree that the issues discussed are sensitive and complex, but we believe the report adequately conveys these points. revise our report to address the Department’s suggestion. DOJ suggested a factual correction to recognize that two decision memorandums were submitted to the Attorney General; one in October 2000, and a second in December 2000. On pages 22 and 23 of our report, we discuss the submission of both Memorandums. We did not adopt the suggestion that we note the options that these memorandum presented, as DOJ had opted not to provide us with the details of its options when we met to discuss them.

Summary:
Private banking has been broadly defined as financial and related services provided to wealthy clients. Recent investigations of private bankers at Citibank and BankBoston continue to keep private banking in the forefront of public attention. Federal banking regulators may review banks’ efforts to prevent or detect money laundering in their private banking activities. Congress continues to look for ways to reinforce current anti- money-laundering laws and, more specifically, to promote due diligence in customer banking relationships. countries. The House Committee on Banking and Financial Services recently introduced legislation that would require financial institutions that open or maintain a U.S. account for a non-publicly-traded foreign entity to maintain a record of identity for each beneficial owner of the account. Federal Reserve Bank of New York reviewed private banking activities at 40 banks. Authors: Most of the banks reviewed had adequate anti-money-laundering programs. Offshore branches are subject to supervision by U.S. regulators, but not to OCC. They say regulators should try to determine whether offshore branches are making efforts to combat money laundering and try to identify what efforts are being made to combat it. in 1998, the Federal Reserve assessed the risk management practices at seven banks with private Banking Secrecy Act activities. 11 of the 20 offshore jurisdictions are identified as having weak or nonexistent regulatory supervisory structures. The National Money Laundering Strategy for 1999 marks a new stage in the government’s fight against money laundering. A major goal is to enhance regulatory oversight while making it cost-effective, with measurable results. Does the jurisdiction have KYC policies or guidelines for banks?

Summary:
In October 2017 and more explicitly in January 2018, the President linked continued U.S. participation in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) to congressional and allied action. On May 8, he announced that the United States would cease implementing the JCPOA, using the mechanism of reimposing suspended U.s. sanctions. This report bases its analysis primarily on the text of key documents involved in the issue, including U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231 and the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of May 22, 2015. missiles to "severe sanctions" The President also called on U.S. allies to "take stronger steps with us to confront Iran's other malign activities" After the January 12, 2018, statement, the President replaced Tillerson and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster with officials who have been critics of the JCPOA. The May 8 announcement signaled that the Administration seeks to encourage further efforts to address its concerns about the J CPOA, according to the State Department's spokesman. and broader Iran issues, possibly in a revised nuclear agreement. According to the May 8 statement As we exit the Iran deal, we will be working with our allies to find a real, comprehensive, and lasting solution to the Iranian nuclear threat. This will include efforts to eliminate the threat of Iran's ballistic missile program, to stop its terrorist activities worldwide, and to block its menacing activity across the Middle East. Iran's leaders will naturally say that they refuse to negotiate a new deal. They refuse, and that's fine. I'd probably say the same thing if I was in their position. The decision drew statements of support from Israel, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain. The leaders of France, Germany, and Britain issued a joint statement expressing "regret" over the decision. European leaders stated that they remained committed to the JCPOA as "important for our joint security" The European reaction appeared to reflect disappointment in the failure of their efforts to address President Trump's concerns through a supplemental agreement or pledges of joint action, says Peter Bergen, a former U.S. ambassador to the European Union. in place, and both indicated they intended to continue implementing the JCPOA even if President Trump ceases to implement it. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani reacted to the May 8 announcement immediately, stating that Iran would work with the remaining parties to the accord to keep it intact. Rouhani directed Iran's nuclear program officials to be prepared to restart suspended aspects of Iran's program if the accord collapses entirely. The Trump Administration could have use d provisions of the J CPOA itself t o cease implementation of U.S. commitments under the agreement. can assert that another party is violating the accord and seek to resolve the issue. The dispute resolution mechanism provides for the United States to be able to "snap back" all sanctions. A U.S. accusation of Iranian noncompliance, in the absence of supporting evidence, would undoubtedly raise questions about the use of this mechanism to leave the agreement. In his October 13, 2017, speech on Iran, President Trump announced that he was withholding INARA compliance certification on the grounds that he cannot certify that continued sanctions relief is "appropriate"

Summary:
H.R. 4818 is the ConsolidatedAppropriations Act, 2005. It incorporated the Transportation, Treasury, andIndependent Agencies FY2005 Appropriations bill and eight other appropriations bills. The bill was held for a correcting resolution ( H.Con.Res. 528 , passedDecember 6, 2004) before being sent to the President. It was signed on December 8, 2004, by President George W. Bush. It provides funding for the Department of Transportation (DOT) and its related agencies, as well as the Treasury, the PostalService, the Executive Office of the President, and General Government provisions. a result of the creation of a new federal department, theDepartment of Homeland Security. The United States Coast Guard and the Transportation Security Administration were transferred from the Department ofTransportation to DHS. Budget numbers for years prior to FY2004 have been adjusted in light of these changes tocompare pre-FY2004 figures with FY2004 and later figures. The FY2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriation was passed as part of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, creating new subcommittees for Homeland Security and combining the former Transportation and Treasury subcommittee into one committee. The Administration's FY2005 budget request for the Departments of Transportation and the Treasury, the Executive Office of the President, and Related Agencies was $88.9 billion. The House cut approximately $47 billion from Title I (Transportation) funding during floordebate. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported out S. 2806 ( S.Rept. 108-342 ), their FY2005 Transportation, Treasury and General Government Appropriations bill, on September15, 2004. The Committee recommended $90.5 billion, $1.6 billion more than the Administrationrequest. Treasury, and the independent agencies included inDivision H, minus a 0.80% across-the-board rescission which applies to the entire omnibus. Official numbers reflecting the rescission are not available, so the numbers in this report do not reflect therescission. The rescission will reduce the Transportation-Treasury appropriation to $89.9 billion, approximately $460 million below the amount provided for FY2004 but approximately $950 million above the Administration request for FY2005. Table 3 shows funding trends for Transportation/Treasury Appropriations from FY1999 through FY2004. House bill included $7.7 billion for this function, while the Senate bill contained almost $ 7.8 billion. Controller union representatives contend that the FAA is not taking sufficient action to mitigate against potential future staff shortages. The House bill tries to remedy this situation by providing an additional $9 million to hire and train new controllers. The Senate bill also addresses this issue and provides an Additional $10 million to hiring and training new controller. The Conference reportincludes provisions that accommodate new hiring andtraining, especially for supervisors. The Administration request for F&E was $2.5 billion, $393 million below the FY2004 enacted figure. Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) would have been subject to a small cut, to $117 million from the $119.4 million in theFY2004 Act. Essential Air Service (EAS) receives its funding from designated user fees collected from overflightsof United States territory by foreign aircraft. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) provides grants for airport development andplanning. The FHWA budget provides funding for the Federal-Aid Highway Program (FAHP), which is the umbrella term for nearly all the highway programs of the agency. Most of the funding is reserved for the major federal-aid highway programs, which can be thought of asthe core programs. All of these programs are subject to apportionment on an annual basis byformula and are not subject to program-by-program appropriation. There is a second category of highway funding. This so called "exempt" category consists mostly of two elements: an additional annual authorization ofminimum guarantee funding ($639 million per fiscal year) and emergency relief. The FMCSA was created by the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999 (MCSIA), P.L. 106-159 . (5) This agency became operational on January 1, 2000, and assumed almost all of the responsibilities and personnel of DOT's Office of MotorCarrier Safety. Most of the funds used to conduct F MCSA activities are derived from the Federal Highway Trust Fund. The FY2005 Administration request for the FMCsa is $455 million. The agency also administers grants and programs to help states conduct truck and bus safety compliance activities. For FY2005, Congressapproved an appropriation of $447.5 million to FMCSA's account. Administration's FY2005 request for these activities is $227 million. House Committee on Appropriations recommended $190million; this was eliminated during House floor debate on a point of order, but wasexpected to be used as the House benchmark during conference discussions.

The Senate Appropriations Committeealso directed MARAD to prepare a conditions and performance report and needsassessment of the nation's inland waterway system in order to prepare for ananticipated increase in domestic and international maritime trade. time ofwar. The intent of the law is to decrease the Department of Defense's reliance onforeign-flag oil tankers. An aspect of the program that has proved controversial is the allowance of up to 10% of a vessel's total steel weight to be constructed by aforeign shipyard. Some argue this is necessary to allow U.S. shipyards to importforeign technological expertise, while others argue that it results in subsidies flowing to foreign shipyards. For FY2005, the Administration requested a budget of $123.25 million for RSPA. Most of this funding is for activities that promote transportation safety. In recent decades, the Treasury Department has performed four basic functions: formulating, recommending, and implementing economic, financial, tax, and fiscal policies. The creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in late 2002 and its assumption of the authorities transferred to it by executive order in March 2003 significantlychanged Treasury's functional profile. While Treasury still serves as a principalsource of economic policymaking within the executive branch of the federalgovernment, its role in law enforcement is now much more circumscribed. by the Bureau of Alcohol,Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF), U.S. Secret Service, Federal Law EnforcementTraining Center, U.s. Customs Service, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network(FinCen), and Treasury Forfeiture Fund. Under the law establishing DHS ( P.L. 107-296 ), the Secret Service and Customs Service were transferred from Treasury to DHS. Many functions of BATF were transferred to the Justice Department (DOJ) The creation of DHS has greatly diminished Treasury's involvement in law enforcement. taxes, classifying those products fortax purposes, and regulating the operations of industrial users of distilled spirits. Treasury is taking steps to revamp its involvement in the federal government's inter-agency fight against the financing of international terrorist networks and other financial crimes. In FY2004, the Treasury Department received $11.100 billion in appropriated funds. Most of these funds were used to fund the operation of the IRS, whose budget was set at $10.184 billion. The remainder of the funds went to Treasury. For FY2005, the Bush Administration requested a budget for Treasury of $11.610 billion, or $510 million above its level of funding in FY2004. The vast share of this budget request was allocated to the IRS, which would receive $10.674 billion. The remainingdepartmental offices and bureaus would receive the following appropriated amounts: departmental offices, $185.0 million; departmental systems and capital investments, $36.2 million; Office of Inspector General, $14.1 million; Treasury Building and Annex Repair and Restoration, $20.3 million. Treasury would receive $11.247 billion in funding in FY2005. The IRS would receive the vast majority of the appropriated funds. H.R. 5025supported the Administration's request to eliminate two current programs. During the debate in the House, several contentious amendments were considered. The House passed the measure 397-12 on September 14, 2004, and the Senate passed it on September 15, 2004. The bill was approved by the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury and Independent Agencies on July 15,2004. or implementing regulationsto allow financial institutions to accept matricula consular cards as a legitimate formof identification for opening new accounts at financial institutions. Another amendment approved during the debatespecified that the Treasury Department may use none of the funds appropriated for FY2005 to plan, enter into, or implement contracts for collection of delinquent taxdebt between the IRS and private debt collectors. The House also approvedamendments to prevent any funds from being used to implement a directive from the Office of Management and Budget that requires federal agencies to open up to competition from the private sector. Treasury's FY2005 budget would be set at $11.329 billion. Nearly 90% of this amount, or $10.253 billion, would go to the IRS. The House and Senate finally agreed on a budget for the Treasury Department in FY2005, in separate votes cast on November 20, 2004. It was included in abroader appropriations measure ( H.R. 4818 , P.L. 108-447 ) known as theConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2005. Under current law, members of the House Ways and Means Committee, Senate Finance Committee, and Joint Committee on Taxation have the authority to examinetax return information. They face criminal and civil penalties if they improperly disclose personal tax information or carelessly lose tax return documents. Republicanleaders in both houses agreed to pass an enrolling resolution( H.Con.Res. 528 ) to delete the provision. Under H.R. 4818 , Treasury is to receive the information under the new law. $11.248 billion in appropriated funds, an amount that does not reflect the mandatory 0.83%across-the-board reduction in spending. Virtually all of this gain (91%) and this shortfall (98%) aretied to approved funding for the IRS, which is set at $10.318 billion in FY2005, or $134.1 million above its funding for FY2004. Three Treasury accounts arereceiving less money than they did in FY2004: Department-Wide Systems andCapital Investments Program ($32.3 million) and Treasury Building and Annex Repair and Restoration ($12.5million) theadministration of the health insurance tax credit (virtually the same amount asFY2004) According to budget documents issued by the IRS, this proposal wasintended to achieve three strategic goals. Public disclosures about illegal corporatetax shelters and sharp declines in audit rates for high-income taxpayers and largecorporations in recent years have sparked heightened congressional scrutiny of the IRS. The IRS estimates that theoverall gross tax gap in the 2001 tax year, the most recent year for which data areavailable, amounted to $310.6 billion.  amendments to H.R. 5025 approved during the floor debate in the House would affect IRS operations in FY2005. One would prevent the IRS from using any appropriated funds to plan, enter into, or implement contracts forcollection of delinquent individual income tax debt involving the IRS and privatedebt collectors. Under S. 2806 as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee (but not considered by the full Senate), IRS operations would be funded at $10.253billion in FY 2005, or $68.8 million more than the FY2004 budget. $4.107 billion for processing, assistance, and management. $4.519 billion for tax law enforcement, $1.606 billion for information systems. $125 million for business systems modernization, and $34.8million for administering health insurance tax credit. $140 million in unobligated balances in account for business systemmodernization would be withdrawn. The House and Senate agreed on a budget for the IRS for FY2005 by passing an omnibus appropriations bill ( H.R. 4818 ) on November 20, 2004.

The bill would allow the OPM Director to determine andtransfer to federal agencies such amounts as necessary to carry out the purposes of the fund. No funds would be obligated or transferred until the Director has notified the relevant subcommittees of the Committees on Appropriations of the approval of an agency's performance plan. theamounts that have been obligated or transferred" (118) The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not recommend and the conference agreement and the law do not provide funding for the performance fund. The President's FY2005 budget proposed an appropriation of $15.449 million for the OSC. The FY2004 appropriation was $13.5 million, but after the 0.59%rescission, the FY2005 funding is $15,325million. The requested amount is 15.1% more thanthe FY2004 funding after the rescission. U.S. Postal Service generates nearly all of its funding by charging users of the mail. It does receive a regular appropriation from Congress to compensate for revenue it forgoes. Under the Revenue Forgone Reform Act of 1993, Congress is authorized to reimburse USPS $29 million each year until 2035. For11 years the payment was provided as a matter of course. In its FY2005 budget, the Bush Administration proposed to provide no funds for the payment, and in the list of "terminations" in the budget. USPS argues that cancelling the payment could result in the whole 30-yearobligation, totaling $899 million, being written off as a bad debt and charged to current postal ratepayers. In its detailed justification of its FY2005 budget request, USPS asked Congress for an additional $779 million in emergency response funds to protect the safety ofemployees and customers from threats such as the 2001 anthrax attack. The Administration's FY2005 Budget does not include anyadditional funds for emergency preparedness for the Postal Service. House Committee on Appropriations recommended, and the House passed, the amounts requested in the President's budget. Conferees provided $598 million for the Postal Service for FY2005, an increase of $502 million over FY2004. This appropriation includes $507 million forbiohazard protection. Senate Committee recommended that the $29 millionpayment for past revenue forgone be continued in FY2005. It also recommended theappropriation of $507. million to an Emergency Preparedness Account for USPS toreimburse it for past and future expenditures. and authorizing agencies to pay GSA bills for spacerenovation and other services. In the past provisions have been included which relateto specific agencies or programs. For both Transportation- and Treasury-relatedgeneral provisions and government-wide general provisions, with noted exceptions, the sections discussed here will be those which are new in the FY2005 budget or which contain modified policies. There are also general provisions at the end of eachindividual title within the bill which relate only to agencies and accounts within thattitle. Under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (FEPCA), federal white-collaremployees, paid under the General Schedule (GS) and related salary systems, are toreceive pay adjustments each year based on two separate mechanisms. By law,the disparity between non-federal and federal salaries is to be reduced to 5% inJanuary 2005. The Administration's FY2005 budget proposed a 1.5% federal civilian pay adjustment, but did not state how the increase would be allocated. The Federal Wage System (FWS) is designed to compensate the federal blue-collar, orskilled labor, force at rates prevailing in local wage areas for like occupations. Since 1979, Congress has limited the ratesof pay adjustment for blue- collar workers to the average percentage pay adjustmentreceived by federal white-collar employees. Part of therationale for the limitation is that, in certain high cost areas, some FWS wages wouldexceed the salaries paid to General Schedule supervisors. Wages in the lower costareas will be allowed to increase according to the findings of the wage surveys. survey data (known as the Monroney Amendment) to Department of Defense personnel. For January 2005, the minimum SES salary is $104,927 and the maximum salary for most members of the SES is $145,600. Those employees in agencies with performance appraisal systems certified by OPM, will be able toreceive a maximum SES Salary of $158,100, an amount equal to that of Members ofCongress and U.S. District Court judges. OPM published regulations to implement the law on January 13, 2004. payfor SES members were published by OPM on July 29, 2004. A $300 million fund would be set asidegovernment-wide to allow managers to reward top-performing individuals withadditional pay over and above any annual across-the-board pay raise. P.L. 108-199 provided an FY2004 appropriation of $1 million for the fund. If Congress is silent on this issue in legislation, the annualadjustment for Members of Congress and other officials becomes effectiveautomatically. Since 2000, either one or both houses have approved provisions in the annual Treasury appropriations bill that would ease U.S. economic sanctions on Cuba. In its statement of policy on H.R.5025, the Administration indicated that the President would veto themeasure if it contained provisions weakening Cuba sanctions. Ultimately, theCuba provisions were not included in the FY2005 omnibus appropriations measure. In June 2004, through new OFAC regulations amending the CACR, the administrationeliminated the category of fully-hosted travel. more suffering for the Cuban people. The House-passed version of H.R. 5025 had three provisions that would have eased Cuba sanctions. The Senate version of the FY2005 Transportation/Treasury appropriations bill, S. 2806, had a provision that wouldhave prohibited funds from administering or enforcing restrictions on Cuba travel ortravel-related transactions. That provision, which was proposed by Senator ByronDorgan, was unanimously approved by the Subcommittee on Transportation,Treasury and the Senate Appropriations Committee. and General Government on September 9, 2004.

Summary:
The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) was founded in 1989 for the purpose of promoting trade and investment liberalization. APEC currently has 21 members: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan (officially, Chinese Taipei), Thailand, the United States, and Vietnam. During the 1994 Economic Leaders' Meeting in Bogor, Indonesia,. APEC members agreed to the Bogor Goals of "free and open trade and. investment in the Asia- Pacific by 2010 for developed economies and 2020 for developing economies" Every year, a different APEC member organizes and hosts a series of meetings. The host member usually picks a theme for the year. The Obama Administration has signaled that the Asia-Pacific region is a foreign policy priority. The U.S. may use the event to inform the APEC members about the status of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations and possibly publicly announce a significant landmark in the TPP talks. The agenda of the Economic Leaders' Meeting usually is based on the host's theme. The EAS was created in 2010 to promote trade and investment expansion. The U.S. and Russia were invited to join the organization in 2010. China is suspicious that the United States joined the EAS to prevent it from creating an Asian-based free trade association that excludes the U.K. and Japan. China and Malaysia have been active proponents of the "10 + 3" approach to Asian economic integration.. The United States would prefer to avoid needless duplication of agendas and obtain more clarity of purpose between APEC and EAS. The United States agreed in 2007 to join APEC's Business Travel Card (ABTC) program. The card allows business travelers pre-cleared, facilitated short-term entry to participating member economies. H.R. 2042 would partially fulfill the U.S. commitment to join the ABTC program by requiring the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish a program to issue APEC business travel cards. It would integrate it with existing registered traveler programs, such as Global Entry, NEXUS, and SENTRI. Representatives passed H.R. 2042 by a voice vote. The bill has been sent to the Senate for consideration. Over the last few years, APEC has emerged as an issue in U.S. relations with China. Some Chinese officials and scholars view the U.s. effort to use APEC to promote an FTAAP and negotiate a TPP without China's participation as part of a greater U.N. strategy of containment of China. As an APEC member, the United States must contribute to the annual budget of APEC. to finance preparations and programs related to hosting APEC in 2011. To finance preparations for the 2011 APEC summit in Japan, the Japanese government has set up a joint account with the Japan Bank for International Cooperation. The joint account will be used to help pay for the cost of hosting the 2011 summit. The fund will also help fund programs and activities related to the 2011 event, such as the APEC Economic Forum and APEC Business Forum, in Japan.

Summary:
H.R. 3652 and S. 2092 were introduced by Rep. Conyers and Sen. Kennedy. The two bills are entitled the "Protecting Employees and Retirees in Business Bankruptcies Act of 2007" In 1984, the Bankruptcy Code was amended to add 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113, which outlines the requirements that must be met before a court can approve rejection of a collective bargaining agreement. The bill asserts that executive pay enhancements flourish in business bankruptcies at the expense of workers and retirees. H.R. 3652 proposes changes to 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113. Bill would limit the modifications to the existing CBA that can be proposed by the debtor. Current law puts no time limit on the duration of the effects a debtor's proposed modifications to a CBA may have on the relevant affected labor group. The bill would limit proposals to those that would (1) limit the effect of the labor group's financial concessions to no more than two years after the effective date of the plan. The bill's second requirement for debtors' proposals is that they must "be no more than the minimal savings necessary to permit the debtor to exit bankruptcy" David Perry: It is questionable whether this will do anything to clarify existing law. Perry: The proposed change would also specify management personnel as one of the groups to be considered in determining whether the labor group is being overly burdened. The language for proposed 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113 could be construed to require those cuts in wages and benefits for employees must be matched by similar cuts for management employees. 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113(b)(1) by (a) presenting a proposal that both treats all parties equitably and proposes changes necessary for reorganization. H.R. 3652 's proposed subsection (c) would have three main prongs as does the current subsection, but most of its similarity ends there. Current practices among companies in bankruptcy may have triggered a perceived need for this provision. It appears that other provisions of this subsection may be in part a part a CBA. The Bildisco Court specifically stated that approving a debtor's request for rejection should not require the courts to determine that negotiations had reached an impasse. CRS is uncertain if including "impasse" in H.R. 3652 is an attempt to resolve a long-standing issue or a response to current court decisions involving the airline industry. As noted below, courts have recently enjoined airlines from issuing CBA's without first reaching an impasse with the debtor. The word appears twice as a concept in proposed 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113. The Railroad Labor Act (RLA), unlike the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), requires parties to "exert every reasonable effort to make ... [an] agreement" If the changes to Â§ 1113(c)(1) are adopted, courts may need to determine if impasse is reached at some earlier point. CRS is uncertain how courts would construe the requirement that the parties be at "impasse" since the proposed bill includes the phrase "further negotiations are not not" likely to produce a mutually satisfactory agreement," courts may use a "more likely than not" standard. If the courts construed "impasse" as equivalent to the recent court interpretations of the RLA standard, requiring an impasse as a prerequisite to rejection could effectively eliminate most rejections. If bargaining takes place before or after the bankruptcy filing, if it takes place over an extended period of time, a company might be forced to liquidate rather than reorganize. Those opposing this provision are likely to argue that a company should be able to negotiate modifications to the CBA. Proposed change mirrors current law in requiring that the debtor provide appropriate information to the representative and bargain in good faith. There is nothing in the bill that explicitly gives the court the discretion to evaluate the representative's counterproposals. Since liquidation of the company normally would involve loss of jobs, it may be in the labor group's interest to make concessions if the debtor cannot reorganize without those concessions. Allowing the courts more discretion might increase those inconsistencies and lead to more "forum shopping" in bankruptcy filings. agreement with debtors and did not have good cause for refusing to agree. The effect was to encourage negotiations, which is what section 1113 was intended to do. It is unclear whether the proposed provisions would encourage both parties to negotiate. H.R. 3652 would establish a presumption that the debtor has overly burdened the labor group in comparison to other groups, including management. Unless that presumption can be effectively rebutted, the debtor will have failed to meet the requirements for rejection. Since BAPCPA became effective, there has been a move toward paying managers incentive payments, which were not restricted. Some of these incentive pay schemes have been rejected by the courts as actually being retention bonuses. In 2006, both the Senate and the House introduced bills that would have limited the use of incentive bonuses. Though the bills were not passed by the 109 th Congress, their provisions are included in H.R. 3652. This bill would extend B APCPA restrictions on retention pay to incentive and severance pay. performance bonuses as well as "bonus[es] of any kind, or other financial returns" before the bankruptcy petition was filed. The bill's proposed amendment to 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113(c)(3) could make it difficult for the court to approve rejection of a CBA if there were any sort of incentive pay. Arguably, this could put a court in the position of having little flexibility to make decisions that could result in the debtor company's successful reorganization. days before the hearing. The court must rule on the application within thirty days unless otherwise agreed to by the debtor and representative. If the court does not rule within the required time, the debtor may unilaterally modify or terminate the CBA pending the court's ruling. H.R. 3652 would extend the period required for notice to at least twenty-one days. The bill would restrict the parties who could appear and be heard, limiting them to only only one party at a time. It would also require the court to hold the hearing within 14 days of the filing date. The creditors would have an opportunity to approve or reject the reorganization plan. H.R. 3652 would not change the current language, but would add a provision regarding allowed administrative claims. The bill proposes no changes to this section while parties continue to negotiate changes to a CBA. If so, it could lead to liquidations rather than reorganizations when interim modifications are essential for the company to remain in business, the authors say.. Currently there is no statute addressing this issue. It would require that the plan be required to provide for full payment of the claims. The bill would add a subsection that would define rejection of a CBA as a breach. This is one of the subsections where the use of a particular word may have import that is not immediately obvious. Under the bill, court-approved rejection would be a breach of contract with the same effect as rejection of any other executory contract under 11 U.S.C. Â§ 365(g) The word breach is used in this proposed subsection merely to identify the rationale for the prescribed remedy. It is possible that the word was used to legislate an effect of rejection. H.R. 3652 would change the law so that all labor groups, even those controlled by the RLA, would have the right to strike when a CBA was rejected. The bill would also preempt all other federal and state laws regarding labor groups' right to engage in self-help. Under current law, there is no provision for future modifications of a CBAs if the debtor's financial condition improves. It is unclear whether those damages are intended to be treated as an administrative expense and, therefore, a priority claim. no later than thirty days after the beginning of the hearing. The bill does not directly address which party will pay for arbitration. It appears, however, that if all of the bill's provisions were to become law, the debtor would probably pay for the arbitration as an administrative expense since subsection (j) provides for reimbursing the representative for reasonable costs and fees incurred. As administrative expenses, they would be considered administrative expenses under the proposed changes to 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113. The bill would require the debtor and authorized representative to meet to determine the effects on the labor group. Under current law, all post-petition obligations that are required by the CBA are considered administrative expenses. The bill would also extend the right to strike to all labor groups whenever a CBA was modified or rejected without their consent. Companies in financial distress may argue that the bill's proposed changes to chapter 11 are insufficiently flexible to allow successful reorganization. If that is their conclusion, they might try to resolve their financial difficulties outside of bankruptcy or choose to liquidate rather than reorganize.

Summary:
 sunset law contains two requisite components: an "action-forcing"mechanism and a framework for the systematic review and evaluation of past performance. Undersunset, agencies "fade into the sunset," unless, following oversight review, the legislature actsaffirmatively to continue their existence. Since 1997, RepresentativeKevin Brady and others have supported the creation of a federal sunset commission, modeled on thesunset commission in Texas. In May 2006 the House leadership announced plans to bring sunset legislation quickly to the House floor. absent congressional action, as would occur under H.R.3282. Although technically inaccurate, both bills are often referred to as sunset measures. Supporters of the measures suggest that there are too many overlapping and ineffective federal programs that contribute to the growing federal deficit. Congress lacks time for thoroughoversight of all existing agencies and programs, and that the commissions would assist. All Democratsvoted against both bills. One Republican voted with the minority on each bill: Representative ChrisShays on H. R. 5766, and Representative Todd Platts on H R. 3282. Congress inperforming its oversight function, thereby reducing fraud, waste, and abuse. Critics of the measurescounter that the bills would cede too much power to the executive branch and the majority politicalparty. H.R. 3282 would create a Federal Agency Sunset Commission (FASC) toreview the efficiency of and public need for federal agencies. The bill would allow the deadline for abolishing an agency to be extended for an additionaltwo years by legislation enacted by a super majority of the House of Representatives and the Senate. the House andSenate are time-consuming, and do not guarantee that a given measure or type of measure will beconsidered in a timely fashion or at all. As introduced, amended incommittee, and ordered reported favorably, H.R. 5766 specifies fast track procedures onlyfor the House of Representatives. With respect to the Senate it reads: "[Language to be provided]." Ordinarily, Members of either house may choose to introduce legislation at any time that theirchamber is in session during a two-year Congress. There are no parameters in the language contained in H.R. 5766 regarding a timeframe for the total duration of the reviews. The provisions suggest multiple ad hoc commissions, with each coming into existence pursuant to an executive order or joint resolution. The bill would require the President to submit to Congress a schedule for establishment of FRCs to review all federal agencies and programs. In contrast, H.r. 3282 envisages the sunset commission as an ongoing institutional body (with rotatingmembership) commission frameworks might arguably engenderresistance. To the extent that some are concerned with the bills individually for ceding too muchpower from Congress to the executive branch, enactment of both bills would serve to compound thepower transfer.

Summary:
Pandemics occur when an influenza virus mutates into a novel strain that is highly transmissible among humans. Pandemics arise periodically but unpredictably and can cause successive waves of disease lasting for up to 3 years. Vaccines reduce the severity of disease or provide immunity by causing the body to produce protective antibodies to fight off a particular virus strain. Antivirals can reduce symptoms and help prevent the spread of influenza by suppressing the growth of the influenza virus. It is likely that seasonal influenza vaccine manufacturers will produce the vaccine used during a pandemic. months to produce, and the lead time needed to scale up production capacity may make it difficult to meet any large-scale, unanticipated demand immediately. Current antiviral production capacity is inadequate to meet expected demand during a pandemic. antivirals can be expensive to stockpile and difficult to administer, depending on the form in which they are given. Since 2000, we and others have reported that federal, state, and local officials need to have information on target groups that have priority for receiving pharmaceutical interventions to know how, where, and to whom to distribute the interventions. such as during a pandemic, when a lack of specific guidance makes it difficult for federal, state, and local officials to plan. For example, in a prior report, we noted that health officials in one state did not know exactly how many individuals were considered a priority for receiving a vaccine. In that case, it took state officials nearly a month to compile data on high-risk individuals, to decide how many doses of vaccine were needed in local areas, and to receive and ship vaccine to counties. CDC’s changes decreased the targeted population from approximately 188 million to 98 million. Surge capacity in public health departments and hospitals will be critical to pandemic response. During a pandemic, hospitals will need to provide care for influenza patients as well as continue providing care for other patients. Seasonal influenza results in more than 200,000 hospital admissions and 36,000 deaths in the U.S. every year, and hospitals were stretched to capacity in some past seasonal influenza outbreaks. pandemic would occur in the context of existing health care provider shortages. 2006, hospitals across the country reported having an estimated 116,000 registered nurse vacancies. Congress passed the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA) in December 2006. Nonpharmaceutical interventions are measures used to reduce the impact of a communitywide infectious disease outbreak without the use of pharmaceuticals. Slowing the spread of disease during a pandemic will be particularly important given anticipated shortages of pharmaceutical interventions and the expectation that a severe pandemic would overwhelm the health care system. New admissions, appeared to be useful in Canada’s management of the SARS outbreak. Communication with the public about a public health emergency by federal officials is a critical component of national preparedness. A pandemic will generate immediate, intense, and sustained demand for information. The public will look to CDC as the source for health-related information during the anthrax incidents, but that CDC was not always able to successfully convey the information that it had. In July 2003, we reported that effective communication between health care providers and the public reinforced the need to adhere to infectious disease control measures. Public-sector stockpiles of antivirals are intended to be used primarily for the treatment of sick individuals. HHS intends to oversee the distribution and administration of federally owned pre-pandemic vaccine to individuals identified as members of the critical workforce. HHS recommends that state and local jurisdictions follow its list of targeted groups in administering the pandemic vaccine. But HHS faces challenges with implementing its strategy for using pharmaceutical interventions, such as the lack of vaccine manufacturing capacity within U.S. borders and the length of time experts anticipate will be needed to manufacture a pandemic Vaccine. The appropriate dosage of antivirals or the exact length of the treatment course needed to make them effective will not be known until the actual pandemic-causing strain emerges. There is also the potential for adverse outcomes that may result from large-scale administration of a newly developed vaccine. The government’s success in vaccinating large numbers of the public with the swine flu vaccine was negated by the development of Guillain-Barré syndrome among hundreds of immunized individuals, leading to several deaths. event only became apparent when the vaccine had been administered to large numbers of people. The United States lacks vaccine manufacturing capacity. HHS estimates that it may take as long as 20 to 23 weeks after the start of the pandemic for the first doses of pandemic vaccine to become available. The high costs of purchasing and storing antivirals calls into question HHS’s plan to rely on state and local jurisdictions to acquire and store their own stockpiles of antiviral. In response, HHS is planning to centralize its distribution system through a single distributor. use of pandemic vaccine, but has not finalized guidance for using antivirals and pre-pandemic vaccine. State and local public health officials and others have stressed that federal guidance on target groups is needed to aid in their pandemic planning efforts. HHS has initiated efforts to improve the surge capacity of health care providers, but these efforts will be challenged during a severe pandemic. In a severe Pandemic, existing health-care provider shortages would worsen as providers become infected through exposure to infected patients or reach exhaustion. Care for and monitor patients at home with the use of electronic information and telecommunications technologies. Call centers will allow patients to contact health care providers in hospitals in order to obtain medical advice regarding home care. HHS has issued two guidance documents to assist health care facilities to plan for providing altered standards of care. With altered standards, instead of treating the sickest or most injured patients first, providers would identify and treat patients who have a critical need for treatment and would be likely to survive, authors say. PAHPA calls for HHS’s Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response to lead and coordinate HHS emergency preparedness and response activities. PAHPA authorizes HHS to award grants to states to assist in operating public health workforce loan repayment programs. HHS will rely on state and local jurisdictions to utilize nonpharmaceutical interventions to help slow the spread of disease and to lessen the burden on the nation”s health care system until a pandemic vaccine is widely available, the authors say.  restrictions on public activities to combat a pandemic may need to be in place for several months. During the 1918-19 pandemic, nonpharmaceutical interventions were implemented for 2 to 8 weeks. In some cases, the public became fatigued with the interventions, leading to public opposition and noncompliance. These restrictions may have negative impacts on the nation’s economy and on the financial well-being of individual households. A fifth challenge for HHS is the lack of trust by U.S. citizens of public health authorities. of the U.S. population would trust federal government public health authorities as a source for accurate information. Under the National Response Framework, HHS is the lead federal agency for public health and medical services. HHS has named spokespersons within HHS to deliver messages to the public before and during an outbreak. HHS will use a departmental public affairs conference line to provide telephone connections for public affairs staff throughout the department. During a pandemic, the HHS communications effort will operate out of its Emergency Communications Center. HHS has identified some of the critical information that the general public will require during a pandemic. HHS has developed message maps to convey that information in a concise format before an outbreak. HHS manages www.pandemicflu.gov, the official U.S. government Web site for disseminating information on pandemics to the public. Survey: 58 percent of the public in the United States did not know what aPandemic is. The public is less willing or is unable to follow some recommendations that HHS plans to communicate. A severe pandemic, such as that of 1918-19, has the potential to result in widespread illness and death and is expected to overwhelm the nation’s ability to respond. According to HHS, initial batches of the most effective protective measure may take as long as 20 to 23 weeks after the start of the pandemic to become available. We believe that finalizing guidance on the use of pharmaceutical interventions will be crucial for responding to a pandemic outbreak and that the necessary guidance documents should be finalized as soon as possible. of federal medical responders to supplement the number of health care providers. HHS noted that the federal government does not have adequate health care personnel to provide surge capacity. HHS also noted that its planning documents for allocating scarce health care resources were intended as “…planning documents for consideration by communities, not for the purposes of establishing definitive standards” Finally, HHS proposed alternate terms for some of the concepts in our report (we have noted these instances in the report). For example, HHS disagreed with our use of the term “altered standards of care” and said that the more appropriate term is “standards of care appropriate to the situation” its guidance to state and local jurisdictions, we did not make this change. The National Response Framework lays out, in part, the manner in which the federal government responds to domestic incidents. The plan is a guide for an all-hazards response, categorizing the types of federal assistance into specific emergency support functions. Primary and supporting agencies are listed for each emergency support function. The report will be available at no charge on GAO’s Web site at http://www.gao.gov. National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza provides a framework for future planning efforts for how the country will prepare for, detect, and respond to an influenza pandemic. Preparing for and responding to a pandemic will not be purely a federal responsibility; it will primarily be a local response. Homeland Security Presidential Directive-21: Public Health and Medical Preparedness provides a strategy for protecting the health of the U.S. population against all disasters, including a Pandemic. HHS has released five updates regarding the progress of the department’s preparedness efforts. According to HHS officials, it is important to have a stockpile of pharmaceutical interventions, when possible, for use during the early stages of a pandemic. The greatest challenge to preparing for an influenza pandemic is the lack of vaccine manufacturing capacity within the United States. HHS has invested over $1 billion in development of a cell-based approach to influenza vaccine manufacturing, which it claims will modernize the current egg-based production process. According to HHS, it anticipates that a licensed cell- based influenza vaccine will be manufactured in 2010.

Summary:
In fiscal year 2006, DOD committed over $1.5 billion to its recruiting effort. Each service has at least two levels of command between the senior headquarters and the recruiting station. A typical frontline military recruiter is between the ages of 25 and 30 years old and has between 5 and 10 years of military service. The Army is using almost 370 contract civilian recruiters, representing approximately 3 percent of the Army’s total recruiting force. In general, training for recruiters is similar in all services and has focused on ethics and sales. The military pays for the applicant to travel to 1 of 65 military entrance processing stations (MEPS) After the recruiter’s prescreening, the applicant signs an enlistment contract and is sworn into the service and enters the delayed entry program. The applicant returns to the processing station just before reporting for basic training, undergoes a brief physical examination, and is swearing into the military. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense has the responsibility for overseeing the recruiting program. However, OUSD has not established a framework to conduct oversight of recruiter irregularities. Recruiter wrongdoing. Although not required by OUSD to do so, the services require their recruiting commands to maintain data for 2 years. The Army Recruiting Command maintains data for 3 years and can retrieve case files back to fiscal year 1998. OUSD has not established criteria for the services to characterize recruiter irregularities or developed common terminology for irregularities. Each of the services uses multiple systems for maintaining data that are not integrated and decentralized processes for identifying and tracking allegations and service-identified incidents. Youth and their parents believe that deployment to a hostile environment is very likely for servicemembers with some types of military specialties. Adults who influence a prospective applicant’s decision about whether to join the military are increasingly fearful of the possibility of death or serious injury to the applicant. Other factors that affect the recruiting environment include a recruiter's location and access to eligible applicants. Over half of U.S. youth aged 16 to 21 are ineligible to join military because they cannot meet DOD or service entry standards. pressure to meet monthly goals contributes to recruiter dissatisfaction. Over 50 percent of active duty military recruiters said they were dissatisfied with their jobs. Army, Navy, and Air Force generally evaluate recruiters on their ability to write contracts to bring applicants into the delayed entry program. Marine Corps recruiters are held accountable when an applicant does not complete basic training and remain responsible for recruiting an additional applicant to replace the former basic trainee, the authors say. The Army spends approximately $17.17 per month to satisfy recruiting goals, they say. E.E. Moser, Assistant Director, Grace A. Coleman, Tanya Cruz, Nicole Gore, Gregg J. Justice III, Mitchell B.

Summary:
Nearly all nursing homes accept residents with either Medicare or Medicaid. The federal government has responsibility for establishing requirements that nursing homes must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 revised the standards for homes’ participation in these federal programs. In 1998, the federal government paid states about $210 million for the nursing home survey and certification process, including about $42 million (20 percent) for investigating complaints. Both federal and state funds finance the costs state agencies incur in inspecting nursing homes. history of poor performance relative to the allegations. States sometimes place complaints in an inappropriately low investigation category, thus postponing a prompt review. Some states have explicit procedures or operating practices that result in the downgrading of a complaint’s severity. Maryland placed most complaints in its lowest-priority category–to be investigated at the next on-site survey. Washington categorized nearly 90 percent of its complaints to be investigated within either 2 or 10 workdays. The number of complaints considered immediate jeopardy in that state had dropped considerably during the first quarter of 1998 in comparison to earlier years. a complaint low priority if the resident is no longer at the nursing home when the complaint is received. The state may investigate these complaints during the home’s next survey or not at all. Failure to investigate such a complaint in a timely manner may compromise the health and safety of other residents who may also be affected by problems cited in the complaint. We identified several cases in which a resident had died or been transferred from the nursingHome that were uninvestigated for several months, or had not yet been investigated. State auditors’ reports identified additional complaints that the auditors found should have been placed in a higher category. Kansas’ auditors said that about 10 percent of 213 complaints reviewed were classified too low. Pennsylvania’s auditors identified several complaints as categorized too low, including one filed by a licensed practical nurse recently employed by the home. The nurse alleged that there had been at least 12 deaths at the home over a 2-week period, including a resident who choked to death because she had mistakenly been given solid food.  states often do not conduct investigations of complaints within the time frames they assign. Some of these complaints, despite alleging serious risk to resident health and safety, remained uninvestigated for several months after the deadline for investigation. Failure by states to investigate complaints promptly can delay the identification of serious problems in nursing homes and postpone needed corrective actions. delayed investigations can prolong, for extended periods, situations in which residents are.entirely within her stomach; and a resident who had received 10 times the prescribed dosage of a medication. HCFA funds, on average, 71 percent of state agencies’ complaint investigation costs. HCFA established a taskforce in 1993 to develop more stringent federal policies for complaint investigations. The task force was disbanded in 1995, and formal policies were not revised. In Maryland and Michigan, a large percentage of such cases was not investigated for extended periods. The HCFA does not provide additional guidance to states on ways to manage complaint workloads efficiently, how to categorize complaints, or when to expand a review beyond the original complaint.  HCFA’s major efforts to monitor states’ performance in surveying and certifying nursing homes are largely focused on annual surveys. Nearly all of the state nursing home inspections that HCFA monitors are annual surveys rather than complaint investigations. Even though HCFA has begun requiring states to include complaint investigations as part of their performance measurement and improvement programs, some states have not yet begun to do so. HCFA requires its regional investigators to replicate or observe a 5-percent sample of state investigators’ nursing home investigations. New York had not yet established performance standards for nursing home complaints. North Carolina’s 1998 quality improvement report acknowledged that the state agency “has fallen behind significantly on investigating complaints within 60 days for nursing homes.” Tracking of complaints is integral to identifying the status of complaint investigations and to managing complaint workloads to appropriately protect residents’ health, authors say. The combination of extensive state practices and limited HCFA oversight has resulted in extensive delays in investigating serious complaints, they say.  AHCA and AAHSA officials noted that the report summarizes some uninvestigated complaints and that the allegations had not yet been substantiated or unsubstantiated. We are making copies of this report available to the honorable Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, the HCFA Administrator; appropriate congressional committees; and interested parties upon request. This report was prepared by Jack Brennan, Mary Ann Curran, C. Robert DeRoy, Gloria Eldridge, and Chick Walter under the direction of John Dicken. For each state, we reviewed laws, regulations, and policies and interviewed leading state agency officials and complaint investigators. In fiscal year 1998, about $300 million was spent by the federal and state governments to certify and perform state licensing functions of federally certified nursing homes. Nearly $60 million, about 20 percent of total nursing home certification and licensing expenditures, was spent on complaint investigations. The federal government contributed about $42 million, or 71 percent, of the costs associated with investigating complaints. Most nursing homes (77 percent) are dually certified for both the Medicare and Medicaid programs. As of December 14, 1998, there were 101 complaints received between 101 and 1,000 beds. January and November 1998, filed against 56 nursing homes in the Baltimore metropolitan area that had not yet been assigned to an investigator. The following table summarizes the complaints filed against 12 of these homes that received three or more such complaints. Table III.1: Unassigned Complaints for Nursing Homes in Baltimore With Three or More Such Complaints Summary of allegation(s) A nurse allowed a respite resident with Alzheimer’s disease to leave the nursing home. Blind resident does not get needed assistance, such as identifying food provided. Nursing home and complainant agreed on a time to discharge a 91-year-old resident with dementia. Home discharged the resident earlier, and the new nursing home was unprepared for resident's arrival. Family was not notified that resident was transferred early and arrived to help the resident move to find that resident had already been transferred. Resident was admitted to the hospital 4 times in 10 years with dehydration and a urinary tract infection. Hospital staff found resident’s intravenous line dirty and clogged because nursing home staff did not flush the line. Home was to investigate and report to the state survey agency. However, as of December 1998, the state did not have the home’s investigative report. Aide smokes in the home and around residents. Same aide mishandled residents—threw them into bed and used nasty language. Understaffing, resulting in the dining room being closed for 2 days. During this time, there were only 3 aides for 70 to 80 residents. Resident had discoloration of chest that family believed was bruise caused by physical abuse. Complainant saw a nursing home. employee shaking resident. Employee terminated by home. Hygiene inadequate--resident was not bathed, teeth not cleaned, and hair not combed. Weight loss from April to June, was 134 lbs. to 120 lbs. Home said resident spit food out and that home had recommended a stomach tube. Caregiver handled resident roughly causing her to “suffer all night” The resident was in a rehabilitation unit receiving treatment for a fractured hip. The resident suffers pain to the touch of bruised areas. As of January 11, 1999, there were 129 complaints, received between February and November 1998, filed against 62 nursing homes in the Detroit metropolitan area that had not been investigated. The following table summarizes the complaints filed against 17 of these homes that received three or more such complaints. This column represents the number of days from the date the complaint was received to the day GAO visited the state agency. The home changed its billing formula resulting in a large increase in fees. The air conditioning does not work properly in one of the wings of the home. A resident's feeding tube was running and vomit was evident in her mouth and on her hands and face. She was found lying in a urine-soaked sheet, and a pressure sore was also urine soaked. A third resident entered the home with no visible skin problems but developed bedsores that led to the amputation of a limb. The home failed to assess a resident’s injury in a timely manner. A resident sustained a fracture of her wrist while taking a shower without supervision. that the home nevertheless bills Medicare for oxygen; resident was advised that his family should come and help to feed him; the resident’s belongings were missing and he was wearing the clothes of other residents; complainant was told by staff that the laundry in the home is done infrequently. A resident was brought into the hospital and was not breathing, was severely dehydrated, and had acute rib fractures and pneumonia. The resident signed himself out of the home and did not return. The complainant indicated that the staff intentionally hid the resident's condition from her for possibly up to one year. 100+ degrees for three days without the home contacting the family. The home schedules only one aide per floor on the midnight shift. One resident was found to have maggots in the sores on his feet, but the home would not send him to the hospital because it was afraid the hospital would call the state. The Director of Nursing specifically told the staff that the resident was not to go anywhere “because the state would be called in to investigate and we do not need that right now” Home was understaffed; a resident was found sitting in the dining room with wet pants; resident found in a gown with no underwear; resident’s clothing missing; resident not helped to bathroom in a timely manner; no therapeutic activities for residents; meals are inadequate; a dog is allowed to roam through the nursing home; offensive odors in the home; resident has been injured as a result of falls. The family also alleges that they have been denied access to her clinical records. hospital emergency room because he had gotten out of bed and fallen. When the family saw him, his arm was completely black and blue. He was also constantly overmedicated. The resident was not properly groomed; food was observed in the heaters; staff did not answer call bells. Staff harassed the resident and his family if they complained about care. Resident developed pressure sores on both feet and had to have part of one leg amputated due to improper care of the sores. The home was short of staff and was falsifying the books. fell down, struck her head, and suffered cracked ribs and various cuts and bruises. Several residents fell out of bed one evening because the side rails were not put up. Food was served cold and there was no staff person to help residents eat. The home was very short staffed and on several nights the complainant was the only nonresident adult in the wing. The resident had bed sores on his heels; he was refused readmission to the home following a hospital stay. He was not properly groomed (bathed and shaved); dirty bed linens were not changed. The home did not check the blood sugar level of a diabetic resident for three days following his admission. On the third day he received two units of insulin when he should have received 100 units. The home gave him potassium pills to normalize his sugar level, but his heart rate went so high that he was taken to the hospital, where he died. Nursing home staff would not permit the resident to go to the bathroom on his own. They did not take proper precautions for pressure sores and did not treat the resident with dignity and respect. Resident fell out of bed and suffered a cut on her head. Staff bandaged the cut but because she had no other marks on her body and could move her arms and legs, X-rays were not taken. Three days later she was taken to the emergency room with elevated heart rate, blood pressure, and sugar level. X-ray confirmed a hip fracture, necessitating hip surgery. The complaint also alleges that the resident previously had experienced dehydration and a urinary tract infection, had two hearing aids and her dentures lost in the home. home and was found a block away by a passerby. He had fallen and suffered a swollen eye, a bruised hand, and a knee abrasion. An employee was verbally abusive to a resident. A resident developed a cut on his foot that became infected. It was left unchecked and spread into the bone. The heel had to be amputated. The resident had a condition that, if vomiting takes place, dictates that the resident should be taken immediately to the emergency room. Although the resident was suffering spells of vomiting, the nursing home failed to send her to the hospital until she was found unconscious. The resident had bruises on her chin, her stomach, and her arms and legs. She suffered a stroke but was not sent to the hospital until the family observed the problem and insisted on hospitalization. The home failed to provide proper dental care. Despite the home’s assurance to the complainant that its dentist was capable of providing care, the resident had to visit an oral surgeon to resolve the problem that had lasted for 15 months. The resident was so over-medicated that the doctor was unable to perform needed gall bladder surgery. found on the floor bleeding from an injury to her head that required 17 stitches. Complaint included 28 separate allegations about the care provided to 17 residents. 90 percent of the home’s beds are old and faulty (big gaps in the side rails), the complaint says. A resident got her head caught in the bed and later died. The administrator would not order needed equipment (such as recliners and geri-chairs) which forced the residents to stay in their beds, the complaint alleges. told staff to call EMS (the community emergency medical service) instead of 911 when a resident was nonresponsive, possibly to save money. One resident was sent to the hospital due to malnutrition and dehydration and died two weeks later. A resident who entered the home with both legs is now a bilateral amputee because he developed pressure sores when staff failed to turn and reposition him or provide heel protection or foot elevation. It was later determined that he had deep vein thrombosis. A resident was admitted with no pressure sores, but developed sores on her heels and legs, became septic, and died. A resident with very bad teeth and gums has received no dental care. Residents complain that their food trays are removed before they are finished eating. A nurse aide was seen striking a resident with a towel. A former employee said the home fired her after 3 weeks of employment because she refused to falsify documents. The home is understaffed; wound care is put off for two to three days. necessary dental care to ensure that his new dentures fit properly. At 10:00 a.m., family members arrived at the home to take the resident to a medical appointment and found her lying in bed, totally soaked in urine, including her hair and pillow. She was lying on top of the made bed, dressed in a hospital gown with her bare feet and legs totally exposed. Complainant believes she was left this way all night because no other beds on the ward were made. problem with her blood sugar. Complainant believes it is possible that the resident was accidentally or intentionally injected with insulin (possibly that of her roommate, who is a diabetic) This column represents the number of days from the date the complaint was received to the day GAO visited the agency. Because Michigan measures its time frame in calender days, not in workdays, we show only calendar days for Michigan. As of January 6, 1999, there were 40 complaints, received between September 1998 and December 1998, filed against 11 nursing homes in the Seattle metropolitan area. Floor of resident’s room was dirty; urine on floor at noon was still there at 4:30 p.m. Staff told resident he could not have bed rails because it was against the law. Staff member slapped resident on leg, which already had nerve damage. Verbal abuse and public humiliation of talkative resident by therapist. Facility reeks of urine. Resident lies on floor in front of elevator and attacks visitors. Catheter leaked and soaked resident, but aide left resident wet; so resident called 911. Staffing inadequate to meet needs of residents. Call lights not answered, or answered late. Reportable incidents not reported and recorded properly. Medication mix-up so that resident received own medications and another resident’s on same morning. Staff shortages leading toward burnout. Resident says young man fractured his hand. Staff treated resident roughly and tried to force him to eat. Doctor unable to answer questions about medications or other care questions. Doctor and nurses intervened, and close monitoring of vital signs followed. check or money order made out to the Superintendent of Documents, when necessary, VISA and MasterCard credit cards are accepted, also.

Summary:
PPACA directed each state to establish and operate a state-based health insurance marketplace by January 1, 2014. Marketplaces were intended to provide a seamless, single point-of-access for individuals to enroll in private health plans, apply for income-based financial assistance, and obtain an eligibility determination for other health coverage programs. In states electing not to establish a marketplace, PPACA required the federal government to operate a marketplace in that state, referred to as a federally facilitated marketplace. For plan year 2016, 13 states had aState-based marketplace, 4 had a State- based marketplace using the federal marketplace platform, 27 had a federal facilitated marketplace, and 7 had a state partnership marketplace. designed to provide support to consumers in completing an application, obtaining eligibility determinations, comparing coverage options, and enrolling in health care coverage. The data hub is a CMS system that acts as a single portal for exchanging information between the federally facilitated marketplace and external partners. The hub was designed as a “private cloud” service supporting the following primary functions: Real-time eligibility queries. Transfer of application and taxpayer information. Exchange and monitoring of enrollment information with issuers of qualified health plans. The data hub is designed to not retain any of the data that it transmits in permanent storage devices, such as hard disks. According to CMS officials, data are stored only momentarily in the data hub’s active memory. The entities that transmit the data are responsible for maintaining copies of their transmissions in case the data need to be re- transmitted. As a result, there is no need for the data to be stored on a permanent hard disk. The data hub has an encrypted system-to- system web browser connection. CMS does not consider the data hub to be a repository of personally identifiable information. State-based marketplaces generally perform the same functions that the federally facilitated marketplace performs for states that do not maintain their own marketplace. In certain cases, states may elect to perform one or both of the plan management and consumer assistance functions while the federal marketplace performs the rest. The specific functions performed by each partner vary from state to state. Most states need to connect their state Medicaid and CHIP agencies to either their state-based marketplace or the federally facilitating marketplace to exchange data. with the IRS (also through the data hub) in order to verify an applicant’s income and family size for the purpose of determining eligibility. State-based marketplaces are to send enrollment confirmations to the federally facilitated marketplace so that CMS can administer advance payments of the premium tax credit and cost-sharing payments. Federal laws and guidance specify requirements for protecting federal systems and data. This includes systems used or operated by a contractor or other organization on behalf of a federal agency. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 requires each agency to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program. contractor, or another organization on behalf of an agency. NIST has developed a risk management framework of standards and guidelines for agencies to follow in developing information security programs. Relevant publications include: Federal Information Processing Standard 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems. Federal Information processing Standard 140-2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, requires agencies to encrypt agency data, where appropriate, using NIST-certified cryptographic modules. The guidance includes privacy controls to be used in conjunction with the specified security controls. Resilient Systems (draft), recommends steps to help develop a more defensible and survivable IT infrastructure. While agencies are not yet required to follow these draft guidelines, they establish a benchmark for effectively coordinating security efforts across complex interconnected systems. Agencies that collect or maintain health information also must comply with additional requirements. The Privacy Act of 1974 places limitations on information security and privacy in the federal government. In addition to FISMA, major laws and regulations establishing requirements for Information Security and Privacy include the following. The act defines a “record” as any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency. A “system of records” is a group of records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual. The Privacy Act requires that when agencies establish or make changes to a system of records, they must notify the public. The E-Government Act requires agencies to identify, among other things, the categories of data collected. of 2002 strives to enhance protection for personal information in government information systems. This assessment is an analysis of how personal information is collected, stored, shared, and managed in a federal system. Agencies must conduct a privacy impact assessment before developing or procuring IT that collects, maintains, or disseminates information that is in an identifiable form or before initiating any new data. More specifically, according to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, a Privacy Impact Assessment is anAnalysis of how information is handled to ensure handling conforms to applicable legal, regulatory, and policy requirements. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 establishes national standards for electronic health care transactions. The act calls for the Secretary of HHS to adopt standards for the electronic exchange, privacy, and security of health information. According to federal regulations, state-based marketplaces are responsible for protecting and ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of marketplace enrollment information. The Privacy Rule reflects basic privacy principles for ensuring the protection of personal health information, the authors say. They say weaknesses remained in both the processes used for managing information security and privacy and the technical implementation of IT security controls. GAO: CMS approved subsidized coverage for 11 of 12 fictitious GAO phone or online applicants for 2014. The applicants obtained a total of about $30,000 in annual advance premium tax credits, plus eligibility for lower costs at time of service. NIST defines an information security incident as a violation or imminent threat of violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices. A security incident can occur under many circumstances and for many reasons. It can be caused by a variety of factors. can be inadvertent, such as from the loss of an electronic device, or deliberate. FISMA requires the establishment of a federal information security incident center. The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) consults with agencies on cyber incidents. It provides technical information about threats and incidents, compiles the information, and publishes it on its website, https://www.us-cert.gov/. US-Cert, established in 2003, is the federal Information Security incident center that fulfills the FISma mandate. Between October 6, 2013, and March 8, 2015, CMS reported 316 incidents affecting Healthcare.gov or key supporting systems. None of the incidents described in the data included any evidence that an attacker had compromised sensitive data, including PII. Of the 316 incidents, 41 were reported to involve PII either not being secured properly or being exposed to an unauthorized individual. CMS also assessed incidents’ impact, categorizing incidents as having an impact of “Extensive/Widespread,’ “Significant/Large,” “Moderate/Limited,�” or “Minor/Localized” information and systems from unauthorized disclosure, modification, and loss. Specific controls include, among other things, those related to identification and authentication of users, authorization restrictions, and configuration management. CMS took steps to protect the security and privacy of data processed and maintained by the complex set of systems and interconnections that support Healthcare.gov, including the data hub. While CMS has taken steps to secure theData hub, we identified weaknesses in the technical controls protecting the data flowing through the system. For example, CMS did not appropriately restrict the use of administrative privileges for data hub systems. The State Based Marketplace Annual Reporting Tool (SMART) is intended to collect information to be used as the basis for evaluating a state-based marketplace’s compliance with regulations and CMS standards. CMS has not defined specific follow-up procedures or time frames, including identifying corrective actions to be performed if deficiencies are identified. Until CMS defines and documents its specific day-to-day procedures, the timing of when control activities are to occur, CMS does not have reasonable assurance that it is providing effective oversight of security and privacy. Although CMS has set requirements for periodic testing of the security controls at the state-based marketplaces, it requires neither continuous monitoring nor comprehensive annual testing. Any state seeking to gain an “authority to connect” to the data hub is required to submit documentation that it has properly secured its planned connection. The standard ‘authority’ to connect is issued for a 3-year period. Following the approval of the initial “ authority to connect,” every state is requiredto conduct reviews of the documentation on a yearly basis. According to the MARS-E, all security controls are required to be assessed over a 3-year period. The states were not required to submit evidence that they had tested subsets of controls each year. The need for better assurance that security and privacy controls are working properly was highlighted by the results of our reviews of technical controls at three state-based marketplaces, which identified significant weaknesses in those systems. For example: One state did not encrypt connections to the authentication servers supporting its system. One state reported 20 of the 27 high open findings during that time period. requires passwords to be encrypted when they are being transmitted across the network. One state did not filter uniform resource locator (URL) requests from the Internet through a web application firewall to prevent hostile requests from reaching the marketplace website. As a result, hostile URL requests could potentially scan and exploit vulnerabilities of the portal and potentially gain access to remaining systems and databases of the marketplace. NIST Special Publication 800-53 requires the enforcement of access controls through the use of firewalls. However, the state didn't fully configure its filtering to block hostile URL request. its Windows servers. NIST Special Publication 800-53 and MARS-E require that if an agency uses encryption, it must use, at a minimum, a Federal Information Processing Standards 140-2–compliant cryptographic module. However, the state did not configure its Windows Active Directory and Domain Name System servers to require the use of Federal Information processing Standards– compliant algorithms. As a result, the servers may employ weak encryption for protecting authentication and communication, increasing the risk that an attacker could compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the system. The results of our work were reported separately in “limited official use only” GAO: Healthcare.gov and its key supporting systems have experienced information security incidents. GAO: The information security weaknesses found in the data hub will likely continue to jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of healthcare.gov. HHS concurred with all of GAO’s recommendations, and provided information regarding specific actions the agency has taken or plans on taking to address these recommendations. The report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov/. as the incident reports and actions taken to mitigate the incidents. We also reviewed the reported impact of each incident. To address our second objective, we reviewed relevant information security laws and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards and guidance to identify federal security and privacy control requirements. Further, we analyzed the overall network control environment, identified interconnectivity and control points, and reviewed controls for the network and servers supporting the data hub. Lastly, we interviewed knowledgeable officials and reviewed CMS policies and procedures for incident handling. In order to evaluate CMS’s controls over its information systems supporting Healthcare.gov, we used our Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual. To assess the effectiveness of the three selected states’ key program elements and management controls, we compared their documented policies, procedures, and practices to the provisions and requirements contained in CMS security and privacy standards for state-based marketplaces. To evaluate the technical controls for the marketplaces, we analyzed the overall network control environment, identified control points, and reviewed controls. We conducted this performance audit from December 2014 to March 2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. In addition to the contacts named above, John de Ferrari, Edward Alexander Jr., Lon Chin, West Coile and Duc Ngo (assistant directors) and Brian Vasquez made key contributions to this report.

Summary:
The International Monetary Fund, conceived at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944, is the institutiondesigned tosupport global trade and economic growth. Initially, the IMF served primarily industrialized countries by supporting currency convertibility and providing them withshort-term financing. With the demise of the fixed exchange-rate system in 1973, industrial countries soon foundlittleneed to draw on the Fund. Most IMF lending draws from the Fund's permanent assets (some $283 billion) provided by member countries (the capitalsubscription or quota) power and borrowing capacity. IMF lending involves providing hard currencies to member countries with balance of payments problems based on need,willingness to adjust policies, and ability to repay. Three types of financing facilities are available under the generalresources account: 1) the stand-by arrangement; 2) the extended arrangement (these two constitute most IMFassistance);and 3) special facilities. Two programs created since December 1997, the Supplemental Reserve Facility (SRF) andtheContingent Credit Line (CCL), amount to special access policies to stand- by and extended arrangements underextenuatingcircumstances. Since the end of the BrettonWoods era in 1973, the IMF has redirected its attention towards the developing world. The IMF arrangementshavegrown in size and maturity, as it has taken on increasingly larger financial "bailouts" The Fund has expandedits roleas a development organization through concessional loan programs to very poor countries. Fourth, short-termbalance ofpayments lending has given way to global financial crisis management. (3) During the 1990s, the concentration of IMF lending was particularly evident. Meltzer Commission: IMF has overstepped its mission of supporting international financial stability. Report proposes that the IMF restrict its lending to only short-term liquidity needs of member countries. Report: IMF, the World Bank, and the regional development banks should write-off all the debt from the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) Report makes the case for restructuring the IMF to as part of a more targeted and much reduced mission,with redefined obligations for members of the Fund. mean time, but athigh loanpenalty rates. Extraordinary circumstances for borrowing such as natural disasters, political turmoil, or emergencyassistance should be done through the relevant multilateral development institutions. IMF arrangements historically (e.g. the 1980s Latin American debt crisis and 1994 Mexican pesodevaluation) have kept private lenders and investors from realizing their full losses and having to implement debtrestructuring on their own. Countries should be strongly encouraged to adopt appropriate "stabilizing monetary and fiscal policies" Four members of the Meltzer Commission dissented from the report and three formally voted against it. Dissenting commissioners had varied opinions, but the collective dissenting statement challenges the report on its analysis,interpretation, and recommendations regarding the role of the IMF in the international economy. Dissenters argue that the report's key recommendation that the IMF restrict itsoperations only to countries that prequalify for assistance based on reforming their financial systems is a flawed strategy. To the extent that this might include large developing countries, theinternational economy may be at greater risk of systemic financial upheaval. The U.S. Treasury issued a formal report supporting the overallmission and effectiveness of the international financial institutions. The report acknowledged the need for reform, butdisagreeing with "the bulk of the Commission's reform prescriptions" Dissenters argued that the report failed to address some key issues, such as advocating for a better "early warning"system to respond in an anticipatory manner to future financial crises. The Treasury calls for adjusting the Contingent Credit Line (CCL), using a graduated scale of lending ratesbased on size of the draw. In a separately issued study prior to release of the Meltzer Commission report, the Council on Foreign Relationspresented the recommendations of another panel of experts on the global financial system. Believing that markets provide theclearestsignals of problems in the international financial system, the report recommends thatamarket-based approach guide reform efforts in borrowing countries. The "broad thrust," therefore, is to "place theprimaryresponsibility for crisis avoidance and resolution in emerging economies back where it belongs" Council on Foreign Relations says IMF assistance should not be used simply to bail out private sector lending and investment. Council report also recommends that the IMF not pursue large bailouts by limiting credit to levels defined inexisting Fund guidelines. The IMF should operate as a monetary institution focusing on fiscal, exchange rate, andmonetary policies and leave long-term structural reform to the development banks, the Council says. Less agreement exists on thedisposition of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) The Meltzer Commission would close it, the U.S. Treasury actively supports its continuation. and early twentieth century period with the1990s. The author documents how the United States endured a financial crisis on average every eight years before making sweeping changes to its financial operations. This experience points to the difficulty in making such deep structural reform that many developing countries now face, as did the U.S. a century ago. Financial capital, for various reasons, has repeatedly found its way backtotroubled countries, including theUnited States in the nineteenth century, despite numerous setbacks. The need forfinancialsector reform, however, may be more compelling. because of this trend; that is, financial sector reform is necessarynotbecause capital will fail to return to crisis countries, but precisely because it will return and hence be a disincentive. (18) Thissupports the universal call for financialsector reform, but notnecessarily the Meltzer Commission's implication that market discipline can force it. Second, the IMF is not the cause of financial crises. Crises were a part of the financial landscape long before BrettonWoods, when capital moved relatively freely among countries. "bailouts" may have some effect on hastening recovery in financially troubled countries, which canbe thoughtof as a "benefit" to counter the "cost" of moral hazard. Still, there is broad preference to find a better, more orderly, way to manage crisis situations. In today's world of pegged exchange rates with less thancredible promises, itappearsthere is little reason to believe that any of various alternatives to floating exchange rates or some extreme form offix(dollarization) is possible. It may be too much to ask the Fund to tame an international financial system wherecapitalmoves freely and speculatively. There is a growing body of literature seeking to find a middle path between continuing large IMF bailouts and leaving financially troubled countries to be disciplined by panicked capital markets. One thrust argues for changing lending rules to include specific contractual obligations that require a collective orderly debt workout if a crisis hits. It appears that oversight actions by the U.S. Congress and institutions representing the international community have beencritical in fostering the many changes. that are taking place within the IMF. Congress has its most leverage,however, whenconsidering appropriations legislation involving IMF funding increases. Since the quota review occurs only onceevery fiveyears and does not always result in a recommendation for an increase, in the interim, Congress must rely on thepublic forum and exerting policy pressure through U.S. representation. Continued oversight surely will be necessary to keep the reform process moving, but more time may be needed tosort outprecisely which policy options will suit the collective, but competing needs of the IMF member countries and otherconstituents.

Summary:
The price of natural gas paid by consumers is layered,in the sense that the wellhead price paid to producers forms a baseline. Pipeline transportation costsare then added, which yields the city gate price. Finally, local distribution companies add additionalcharges to yield the prices actually paid by Consumers. Residential consumers pay the highest prices, followed by commercial, industrial, and electricityusers. The residential prices presented in Table 1 represent an increase of 7% over residential pricesfor a comparable period in 2003. The most recent EIA natural gas price data available at the timeof this report was August 2004. York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), natural gas fordelivery in December 2004 was trading at $6.80 per mcf and January and February 2005 natural gaswas trading at over $7.50 per mCF. The process of natural gas pricederegulation began in 1978 when the Natural Gas Policy Act ( P.L. 95-621 ) became law. Under theNatural gas Policy Act, nearly all price controls were phased out by the end of 1984. The NYMEX future price is determined by the interaction of traderswho have business interests in the real, physical natural gas market. Interstate pipeline rates are not directly regulated and their pricing structure largely reflects open access for shippers and market pricing. The city gate price includes the addition of these pipeline transportation charges. Residential and small commercial natural gas prices are generally higher than the wellhead price because of processing and transportation costs. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) monitors pipeline tariffs to assure "just and reasonable" pricing. consumers buy gas from a local distribution company. Local distribution companies areregulated by state public service commissions, who set distribution charges. The price premium paid by residential and commercial consumers reflects the high fixed cost associated with distribution of their supply. The EIA defines effective productive capacity as the maximum production available fromnatural gas wells. The effective capacity utilization rate (ECUR) is the ratio of actual production to effective productivecapacity. Surplus capacity is the difference between effectiveproductive capacity and actualproduction. Figure 2 shows the history of the ECUR, capacity and production since 1985. Productive capacity has declined since the late 1980s, but appears to haveremained stable since 1993. Actual production has trended up from 1985 to 1995 and has beenrelatively stable since then. An ECUR in excess of 90% indicates that available natural gas output is nearly fully allocated to meeting demand. If thesesources are unavailable for expansion the price could rise dramatically, and supply disruption mightoccur. quickly brought to the market by increasing production from existing wells. Figure 3 shows the history of the wellhead price of natural gas from 1973 through 2003. The first run up in prices, from 1973 to the mid 1980s was theresult of price deregulation in a market where supply was not abundant, demand-after years ofregulated prices-was strong, and oil prices were high. Prices declined after1985-as did demand-and the United States entered a decade long period of relatively low, stableprices. remaining at, or above, 90% since 1995. These conditions set the stage for the gas priceincreases and price volatility experienced since 2000. The EIA reported that the average monthly drill rig count for 2003 was 872, with the count running over 900 per month from June toDecember. (7) Whether the recent increase in drilling activity resultsin large enough supply increases to allow the price of natural gas to fall depends on the explorationsuccess rate, the size of the fields found, and the degree to which existing producing wells showoutput declines. When the ECUR is below 90% extra pressure on the market is likely to result in higher production. Once theECUR rises to 90% or above, timely increases in production are less available and pressure on themarket manifests itself as higher prices. Higher prices for natural gas justify investment in exploratory drilling by increasing the value of the expected cash flow derived from the new production. The nature of this relationship in the natural gas industry can, under some circumstances, lead to a cycle of unstable boom and bust feared by those investing in gas production. completed. The volume of gas held in storage is a critical element in evaluating the possibility of price volatility. If storage volumes are below normal as the winter heating season begins, and the ECURis above 90%, the potential for elevated prices must be considered to be high. As a result, dependence on LNG maysafeguard the nation from physical shortage by building a new, higher, baseline price into the market. The cost of a complete LNG facility has fallen substantially due to economies of scale and enhanced technology. Figure 5 shows the variability of storage volumes of working gas. Stored volumes totaled 2.7tcf at the end of the 2000 refill season. The severe temperatures during the heating season of2000-01 drew this down to a low of 742 billion cubic feet (bcf) in March of 2001. In November 2004 working gas storage levels were above their previous levels. The storage levels are expected to remain above their current levels until at least 2015. For more information, visit the EIA's Natural Gas Storage Report. five yearaverage, suggesting that adequate supplies were available. The EIA reported that by November 26,2004 stocks in the lower 48 states totaled about 3.3 tcf, about 0.2 tcf more than at the same time in 2003. High, sustained levels of natural gas prices can act asa drag on economic growth. High natural gas price shocks canconstitute a classic supply side shock which reduces output and productivity growth. If severeenough, a shock of this type can increase unemployment and cause inflation in the short term. specific industrial users who make heavy use of natural gas in their production process, which makes themuncompetitive. Residential users might have difficulty paying their winter heating bills, forcing them to choose between adequate home heating and other necessities. To help mitigate the effects of possible price spikes this winter, aid to lowincome gas consumers through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) could be increased. Much can be done to alter the demand and supply characteristics of the natural gas market in the long term. Conservation, expansion of LNG use, access to areas not currently available forexploration, and new pipeline construction, among others can be debated. Any of these options willtake significant time to implement and must be considered in a long term context. None of themare likely to have significant influence on prices over the next six months to one year. The price of gold is expected to remain around $1,400 per ounce for the next 12 months, according to analysts at Citi. The value of the euro is also expected to stay above $1.30 per ounce. The euro has been under pressure since the start of the year due to fears of a global economic slowdown.

Summary:
The organization that became NOAA was established in 1807, and in 1836 it officially became known as the Coast Survey. The Survey dispatched technical and scientific teams to survey the uncharted U.S. coastline and relied on the Army and the Navy to supply personnel. After the Civil War, the Army withdrew from the Survey’s work; the Navy withdrew during the Spanish-American War, leaving the work to be done solely by the employees of the newly named Coast and Geodetic Survey. In 1917, Congress passed legislation authorizing the President to transfer the Survey’s ships and men to the Navy and War Departments for the duration of the war. In World War II, about half of the commissioned officers and ships of the Coast and Geodetic Survey were temporarily transferred to the armed services. Officers’ duties included training amphibious troops in seamanship and navigation, serving as battalion observation officers, and executing hydrographic surveys in advance of fleet operations in the Pacific. At the end of the war, all Survey ships and officers were returned to the Coast and Geodetic Survey and to civilian duties. However, the Corps continued to exist, and its officers retained their military ranks and compensation. Corps officers are assigned to work in all component offices of NOAA. Corps officials said officers can expect to serve one-third of their careers in each of the five line offices. In April 1995, the Office of the Administrator assigned Corps officers to the National Marine Fisheries Service, National Weather Service, and National Ocean Service. In October 1994, the Corps had approximately 400 commissioned officers. The Corps was reduced to 332 officers as of July 1, 1996. The ultimate downsizing goal was to reduce the number of officers to 285 by the year 2000. NOAA has since expressed an interest in eliminating the Corps and using civilian employees to carry out the Corps’ functions. In January 1996, NOAA’s Administrator announced that the NOAA Corps would begin a transition to civilian status on October 1,. 1996, and directed that the transition be completed within 6 months. He asked the Director of NOAA Corps operations to develop the following work categories. The NOAA Corps has not been incorporated into the armed forces since World War II. Corps officers continue to receive virtually the same pay and benefits (including retirement) as the military. NOAA cannot press criminal charges or pass sentence against an officer who disobeys orders, and Corps officers can quit the Corps without legal sanctions. NOAA contracted with Arthur Andersen LLP to determine the comparative costs of using civilian employees rather than Corps officers to carry out the Corps’ functions. We found that some Corps assignments are of this nature, but civilian employees are often assigned to duties similar to those of the Corps. Arthur Andersen LLP report concluded that civilianization of the Corps would increase government costs by $573,000 a year. This estimate was based on actual costs incurred during the year ending June 30, 1995, and used a Corps strength of 384 officers. If the Corps is downsized as intended, the estimated cost savings would be smaller in subsequent years, the report says. If civilian employees had been used, the cost to the government would have been about $661,000 lower, it says. NOAA Corps officers pay no federal income taxes on their housing and subsistence allowances. The tax advantage comes in the form of a loss to the U.S. Treasury, authors say. They estimate the annual tax advantage associated with the allowance amounts used in the Arthur Andersen LLP study would be $1,234,000 a year. If a decision were made to civilianize the NOAA Corps, whether there would be any actual cost reductions would depend, in large part, on the manner in which a transition to civilian employment would be carried out. Any decision to replace Corps officers with civilian employees could be implemented in a number of ways. The possibilities range from requiring all officers to immediately convert to civilian employment, to longer-range measures such as allowing all current officers to remain in place until retirement or other separation. The amount of transition costs would also depend on how considerations such as the following were resolved. (1) What retirement benefits or credits are given to officers for the time they spend in the Corps before converting. (2) What resources would be required to recruit, train, and retain civilian employees. be needed to replace Corps officers who opt to leave federal service. The amount of additional resources, if any, that would be required to administer the civilian workforce at NOAA after civilianizing the Corps and its administrative personnel. A plan of action that addresses each of the above factors and other possible considerations would be needed before estimates of the transition costs involved could be determined. The Department of Commerce provided written comments on a draft of this report. The comments are provided in their entirety in appendix II and are discussed below. criteria focused exclusively on the military services, rather than on uniformed services in general. In our opinion, the criteria we used were appropriate. The Department expressed an opinion that the report did not sufficiently address the ways in which service with the Corps is similar to military service. It should also be noted that the criteria for military compensation articulated in the DOD report are based on the need for inducements and incentives to maintain a force necessary “to insure successful accomplishment of the United States national security objectives” The objective of this report is to provide information on the operations of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Commissioned Corps. We were asked to address why the NOAA Corps exists; what the Corps officers’ duties are; how the Corps is similar to and different from the military. To compare the costs of using uniformed personnel or civilian employees to carry out Corps duties, we reviewed the findings in an August 1995 report prepared by Arthur Andersen LLP under a contract with NOAA. We examined the contractor’s approach and methodology and generally found them to be similar to those we would have used. The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.

Summary:
PBGC was created as a government corporation by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) PBGC guarantees the retirement income of U.S. workers with private-sector defined benefit plans. In 2003, GAO designated PBGC’s single-employer program as high-risk, and PBGC has remained high- risk with each subsequent update, including our most recent update in 2009. This means that the program still needs urgent congressional attention and agency action, says GAO.  PBGC’s first communication with participants is generally a letter informing them that their pension plan has been terminated and that PBGC has become the plan trustee. PBGC also operates a customer service center with a toll-free number that participants can call if they have questions. If the participant is already retired, or retires before the benefit determination process is complete, PBGC makes payments to the retiree based on an estimate of what the final benefit amount will be.in detail below.  PBGC does not systematically track the number of participants affected by the limits on guaranteed benefits. PBGC has conducted two studies on the impact of these limits in a sample of large plans. We found cases where estimated benefits were adjusted within 9 months of termination, while in other cases, more than 6 years elapsed before estimates were adjusted. Even for participants who are not yet receiving benefits, the lack of communication about the likely amount of their final benefits makes it difficult to plan for retirement, we found.  PBGC officials have taken steps to shorten the benefit determination process. The agency has also developed more than 500 letter formats to address the myriad of situations that may arise in the process. Officials acknowledged that their standard letter formats may not always meet the needs of participants, especially those with complex plans. They were generally sympathetic to the difficulty of communicating such complicated information. As one advocate acknowledged, for the letters to be accurate, they have to be complicated; this may just be “the nature of the beast.”  PBGC recently undertook a project to review and update their letters to try to better meet participant needs. The vast majority of participants in terminated plans are not affected by overpayments or PBGC’s recoupment process. When an overpayment occurs, retirees typically repay the amount owed by having their monthly benefits reduced by some fraction until the debt is repaid. According to PBGC data, 22,623 participants in plans terminated and trusteed during fiscal years 2000 through 2008 (2.1% of the total) Some pension advocates and union representatives said that this is often the case in complex cases involving large benefit reductions. In the participant files we reviewed, the benefit statements that accompanied the letters ranged in length from 2 to 8 pages. In some cases, there were as many as 20 to 30 different line items that required making comparisons between the items to understand the logic of the calculations. Participants may appeal the results of the benefit determination process within 45 days of receiving a final benefit determination. Appeals are accepted.  PBGC policy stipulates that in cases with an ongoing payment, recoupment of an overpayment may not be waived unless the monthly reduction would be less than $5. Federal agencies such as the Social Security Administration and the Office of Personnel Management generally pursue repayment at a faster rate with larger reductions to benefits when recouping overpayments. To address the concerns of workers and retirees in terminated plans who stand to lose as much as one-half or more of their long-anticipated retirement income, PBGC needs a more strategic approach. GAO: PBGC should develop a better strategy for processing complex plans. PBGC generally agreed with our recommendations, noted the steps it would take to address GAO’s concerns. For example, PBGC said that it had started to track and monitor tasks associated with processing large, complex plans, and would continue to look for other ways to improve its processes. A complete discussion of our recommendations and PBGC's comments, can be found at: http://www.gao.org/news/features/top-stories/2013/01/30/gao-recommends- PBGC-develop-a-better-strategy-for-processing-complex- plans.  PBGC’s financial challenges continue to mount and dramatic increases to PBGC's workload appear imminent, GAO says. GAO: Improvements in PBGC processes are urgently needed.

Summary:
If confirmed, Elena Kagan would be the first serving Solicitor General to be appointed to the Court since the elevation of Thurgood Marshall in 1967. She would also be only the fifth of 111 Justices to come to the bench with such experience. Kagan is ultimately responsible for the government's appellate litigation before the Supreme Court. If confirmed, it is possible that she would have to recuse herself from a number cases in which the government took part during the 2010 Supreme Court term. to file an amicus brief without the consent of the parties. The Solicitor General may choose to confess error, meaning that she recommends that the Court overturn a "flawed" decision. According to one scholar, "[m]ost confessions of error involve criminal convictions, and happen for a range of reasons" It tests the strength of our belief that the office has a peculiar responsibility to the Court, former Solicitors General Archibald Cox said. It affects the. It tests our belief of the office's commitment to the court, he said. Some scholars argue that the Court has placed a great deal of confidence and trust in the judgment of the Solicitor General's office. This trust is more centrally reflected in the office's impressive success rate in securing review for and winning on the merits in the cases supported by the office. Some observers of the Court argue, however, that the relationship between the Court and the office is not a function of a "special relationship," but the skill of theOffice's advocates. The opportunity to argue multiple times before the Court not only hones one's skills, but also generates familiarity with the preferences of the Justices. The Solicitor General will be successful when she and a majority of the members of the Court have similar policy goals. One study found a 50% increase in the probability that the Court would decide a case in a manner consistent with a Solicitors General's amicus brief. Some argue that scholarly focus on the similarity of the policy preferences fails to recognize the important component of this interaction—the weight of the law. The greater the overt politicization of the Solicsitor General's office, the less effective the office will be before the Court on the merits, one study says. Only 4 of the 111 Justices have served as Solicitor General prior to their elevation to the Court. All practiced law in a private firm at some point in their careers, although the length of time each spent in private practice ranged from 4 years (Taft and Marshall) to 21 years (Jackson) Alone among these four, Marshall spent 21 years litigating public interest cases for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Two of these Justices, Chief Justice Taft and Justice Marshall, served as federal appellate judges. Justices Reed and Jackson did not. nominated by President Benjamin Harrison to be a circuit court judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Taft had, what one scholar described as, an "immensely satisfying [eight-year]career" in which he wrote 200 opinions, only one of which was a dissent. President Taft lost his election for a second term in office in 1912 and, in 1913, joined the faculty at Yale Law School. While teaching at Yale, Taft also served as president of the American Bar Association and joint chairman of the National War Labor Board. President Taft was nominated to replace Chief Justice White on June 20, 1921, and confirmed on the same day by a 60-4 vote. Chief Justice Taft is principally responsible for the Judges' Bill of 1925, which gave the Supreme Court more power. Taft and his supporters engaged in a campaign to elevate Taft to the post, which included calling ailing Chief justice White to encourage him to resign. The Supreme Court "was and always had been the ambition" of Taft's life. Stanley Reed was the 77 th Justice and the second Solicitor General to be appointed to the Court. Reed began his legal career after studying law at Yale and the Sorbonne. During his first few years, Reed unsuccessfully defended the constitutionality of New Deal economic regulations, such as the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act. Reed's nomination encountered very little opposition and was subject to a single hearing on January 10, 1938. He handled a good many cases before the Supreme Court of the United States. Reed served on the Court for 21 years before retiring in 1957. He was the 82 nd individual to be appointed to the Court. In 1934, he began his legal career at the age of 21 in 1913. Reed's nomination was unanimously confirmed five days later on January 25, 1938. Reed was confirmed as a Supreme Court Justice on January 26, 1938, by a vote of 9-0. He served on a Court that was established in 1789. He is the only person to have served on both the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals. entered full-time service as a general counsel for the Bureau of Internal Revenue in the Treasury Department. In March 1936, Jackson became assistant Attorney General of the Tax Division. Less than two months later, he assumed the position of Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division. In this position, he argued 10 cases before the Supreme Court. This arguably prepared Jackson well for his next position, that of Solicitor General of U.S. on March 4, 1938. He was noted for his ability to cut to the heart of a case when arguing before the Court. Robert Jackson was appointed to be the Attorney General in January 1940. He remained in that position until July 1941, when he was elevated to the Supreme Court. In total, Justice Jackson served as a government attorney in five different capacities within the Department of Justice. He argued before the Court on 37 separate occasions prior to joining the Court. During the four days of public hearings on Jackson's Supreme Court nomination, witnesses raised questions about certain actions taken by the Justice Department under Jackson's leadership. Senator Millard Tydings argued that Attorney General Jackson should have pursued the prosecution of radio show hosts who accused the Senator of using WPA money to improve his private property. Thurgood Marshall was the 96 th Justice and the first African-American to be appointed to the Court. Justice Jackson served as the chief U.S. prosecutor at the Nuremburg Trials at the request of President Harry S. Truman. Marshall spent much of his time volunteering with the Baltimore chapter of the NAACP. After serving over 13 years on the Court, Justice Jackson died suddenly of a heart attack on October 9, 1954. He is survived by his wife, Mildred, and their three children. Thurgood Marshall was one of the architects of the NAACP's legal strategy that eventually led to the landmark 1954 Supreme Court decision Brown v. Topeka Board of Education. He was appointed to be a circuit court judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1962. As Solicitor General, Marshall argued 19 cases before the Court in which the government was a party; of these, he won 14. President Johnson nominated Marshall to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. Elena Kagan is the 45 th Solicitor General of the United States. She is also the first woman to hold this position. Kagan served as a clerk for the Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall on the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1999, Kagan became Dean of the Harvard Law School. She was credited with building consensus across ideological lines at Harvard, including hiring professors with diverse political outlooks. She has been counsel of record for over a hundred merits briefs and has argued six cases before the Court. The question has arisen as to whether Elena Kagan, if confirmed as a Supreme Court Justice, would need to disqualify and recuse herself from cases with which she was involved during her tenure as Solicitor General. The issue of recusal of government attorneys because of prior involvement with a case has most often arisen where a judge had formerly been a prosecutor, and had been involved with criminal proceedings regarding a particular client. For instance, where a former prosecutor, now a judge, had was involved in. a criminal investigation concerning a defendant in a case now before him, the courts have held the judge may be disqualified. Similarly, where a judge was involved in his previous capacity in. preparing or signing an information or a complaint against the defendant, assisting the grand jury, preparing or. signing an indictment, participating in an arraignment, or other prosecutorial functions and actions, the. courts have generally ruled that the judge was disqualified from acting in a later criminal. proceeding involving the same defendant. In some state cases, courts have recognized that numerous statutes require attorneys general, regional district attorneys, and other supervisory personnel to sign all motions, briefs, appeals. their signatures affixed to various prosecutorial documents prior to becoming judges were not thereby disqualified from subsequently trying the defendant in the same case. It is not clear, however, that this exception would be available for federal judges under 28 U.S.C. §455. The role of the Solicitor General is unique in the American legal system. The office is also charged with assisting the Supreme Court in the exercise of its judicial function. Through repeated opportunities to argue before the Court, some suggest that the office has built a "special relationship" Only four former or current Solicitors General have been elevated to the highest bench. If Elena Kagan is confirmed, she would be the fifth Solicitor General to serve on the Court. Her lack of judicial and litigation experience has raised questions as to whether she is qualified to sit on the Supreme Court. But it is clear that the experience of serving in the office provides the occupant of the office with unique insights into the Supreme. Court.and providing the highest quality arguments for the Court's consideration.

Summary:
The most commonly funded projects were in the area of biology (423 projects), followed by treatment and interventions (253 projects), and causes (159 projects) NIH funded a majority of the autism research projects in five of the seven research areas. Five agencies that funded non-research autism-related activities from fiscal years 2008 through 2011 funded activities that were not duplicative. CDC is the only agency funding an awareness campaign on autism and other developmental disabilities. The IACC and federal agencies may have missed opportunities to coordinate federal autism activities and reduce the risk of duplication. The CAA requires the IACC to coordinate HHS autism activities and monitor federal autism activities. OARC officials stated that the prevention of duplication among individual projects in agency portfolios is not specified in the CAA as one of IACC’s statutory responsibilities. HHS did not concur with our recommendation that such an analysis by the I ACC to identify duplication would not likely provide the detail needed to determine actual duplication. We agree that further analysis would be needed to identify actual duplication of effort and resources.

Summary:
The Medicaid drug rebate program provides savings to state Medicaid programs. Rebates are based on two prices per drug that manufacturers report to CMS: best price and AMP. Best price is the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any wholesaler, retailer, provider, health maintenance organization (HMO), or nonprofit or government entity. AMP is defined by statute as the average price paid to a manufacturer for the drug by wholesalers for drugs distributed to the retail pharmacy class of trade, according to the rebate agreement. AMP and by a lack of manufacturer documentation. Although OIG in some cases identified problems with manufacturers’ price determination methods and reported prices, CMS had not followed up with manufacturers to make sure that those problems were resolved. In its first review of manufacturer-reported prices in 1992, OIG found that it could not verify the AMPs reported by the four manufacturers it reviewed. OIG recommended that CMS have the manufacturer revise its AMP data. As of October 2004, it had not required any such revision of the audited manufacturer’s AMP determinations. how manufacturers were treating repackagers. HMOs that repackage or relabel drugs under their own names. States lost $80.7 million in rebates in fiscal year 1999 because of improperly excluded drug sales. Manufacturers made varying assumptions about which sales and prices to include and exclude from their determinations of best price and AMP, OIG found. It found that in some cases manufacturers’ assumptions could have led to lower rebates and in other cases to higher rebates. CMS officials told us that they make determinations about PBM payments on a case-by-case basis. Any change in the determination of best price and AMP could raise or lower rebates. Incorporating PBM-negotiated manufacturer payments into the rebate determination could decrease the unit rebate amount for a drug. HHS agreed with the importance of guidance to manufacturers, but disagreed with our conclusion that there has been inadequate program oversight, the report said.. We acknowledged HHS’s oversight actions, but stated that HHS oversight does not adequately ensure the accuracy of manufacturer-reported prices and rebates paid to states. Price determination methods.

Summary:
 deadline suit is a lawsuit in which an individual or entity sues because EPA has allegedly failed to perform any nondiscretionary act or duty by a deadline established in law. For example, a person suing EPA because EPA failed to issue a rule by a date established in statute. A person may sue EPA because it missed a recurring deadline to review and revise, as necessary or appropriate, an existing rule. In August 2011, we reported that the number of new environmental litigation cases—of all types—filed against EPA each year from fiscal year 1995 through fiscal year 2010 averaged 155 cases per year. The term settlement refers to both settlement agreements and consent decrees. Both are negotiated agreements between EPA and the plaintiff. A settlement agreement is not subject to court approval but can result in a stay of the lawsuit. A consent decree is entered as a court order. If EPA fails to meet the terms of a consent decree, the court can enforce or modify the consent decree. The court can cite EPA for contempt of court, among other things, if it fails to comply with the decree. It generally follows procedures prescribed in the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) GAO identified seven key environmental laws for which EPA has primary regulatory authority that allow citizens to file a deadline suit. EPA works with DOJ to consider several factors in determining whether or not to settle the deadline suit and the terms of any settlement. With the exception of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to- Know Act, citizen suits may only be filed to compel certain actions listed in the law. For example, the provision in the Clean Air Act states: “ny person may commence a civil action on his own behalf - … against the Administrator.” EPA and DOJ work together to determine how to respond to the lawsuit. EPA and DOJ have an agreement under which both must concur in the settlement of any case in which DOJ represents EPA. EPA issued 32 major rules from May 31, 2008 through June 1, 2013. They were all Clean Air Act rules. The terms of settlements in deadline suits that resulted in EPA issuing major rules in the last 5 years established a schedule to either promulgate a statutorily required rule or make a determination that doing so is not appropriate or necessary. GAO: Most of the resources available to complete RTRs are focused on a 2011 settlement. GAO: EPA accounts for anticipated workload arising out of litigation in its budgeting cycle for affected programs but does not make changes in existing budget allocations specifically to address settlements in deadline suits.

Summary:
Endangered and threatened species are controversial, in part because dwindling species are often harbingers of resource scarcity. Most common cause of species' decline is habitat loss or alteration. Of the 1,358 U.S. species, 1,168 (86.0%) are covered in recovery plans. As of October 20, 2008, a total of 1,183 species of animals and 749 species of plants were listed as either endangered or threatened under the ESA, of which the majority occur in the United States and its territories.  conservationists increasingly are talking about ecosystems as the units of interest, rather than species. At times, efforts to protect and recover listed species are controversial. Declining species often function like the proverbial canary in the coal mine, by flagging larger issues of resource scarcity and altered ecosystems. Species may be listed on the ESA on the basis of their relationships with other species, as well as their status as threatened or endangered. They may also be listed based on their conservation status, such as "threatened" or "endangered" The Secretary must decide whether to list the species based only on the best available scientific and commercial information. With certain exceptions, the Secretary must designate critical habitat (CH) in areas where the species is currently found or which might provide additional habitat for the species' recovery. As of October 20, 2008, FWS had designated CH for 38.7% of listed domestic species. The duty to avoid adverse modification of CH is an express obligation only for federal agencies and actions, or private actors in actions with a federal nexus. exemption if the Secretary of Defense determines that an exemption is necessary for national security (16 U.S.C. § 1536) The Department of Defense (DOD) has claimed that requirements under ESA conflict with its readiness activities, but DOD has not requested any exemptions to date. Other statutes may provide for waivers of ESA provisions. Section 102(c) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 provides for a waiver of ESA and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Congress, Section 3 of H.R. 6895 would exempt construction and operation of a nuclear facility, approved under an accelerated procedure, from ESA. According to FWS, any hurricane-related federal activities in presidentially declared disaster areas would trigger the emergency consultation provisions of ESA. For the 2005 Gulf of Mexico hurricanes, FWS stated that restoring "any infrastructure damaged or lost due to the hurricane back into the original footprint does not require ESA consultation with the Service" The appropriate Secretary generally must develop a recovery plan. A 1988 amendment forbade the Secretary from favoring particular taxonomic groups. In 2008, FWS published guidance on the use of a crediting framework in carrying out recovery measures. Critics question whether the level of accountability for and enforcement of actions on private land would protect listed species comparable to what federal agencies are required to provide on public lands. The appropriate Secretary must cooperate with the states in conserving protected species and must enter into cooperative agreements to assist states in their endangered species programs, if the programs meet certain specified standards. ESA is the domestic implementing legislation for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. CITES parallels ESA by dividing its listed species into groups, according to the estimated risk of extinction, but uses three major categories (called Appendices) rather than two. In contrast to ESA, CitES classifies species based solely on the risk that trade poses to their survival. ESA makes violations of the law punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Under CITES, the Conference of Parties convenes every two to three years. At these meetings, the parties vote on adopting amendments to Appendices I and II. The most recent COP was held in June 2007 in The Hague, Netherlands. The next COP will be held in Doha, Qatar, in 2010. In the 110 th COP, decisions regarding the listing of species were discussed. They included denying a proposal to review restrictions on whales, listing species of sawfish and European eel. International illegal wildlife trade is estimated to be worth more than $10 billion annually. The United States is considered one of the largest importers of illegal wildlife and wildlife products. CITES as well as the Lacey Act are two of the primary policy mechanisms that address the illegal Wildlife trade. Several legislative proposals were introduced in the 110 th Congress to address illegal wildlifetrade. These measures centered on establishing a list of acceptable species that could enter the United States and increasing the enforcement capacity of FWS. rhinoceroses, Asian and African elephants, marine turtles, and great apes (gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans, and the various species of gibbons) This fund supports conservation efforts benefitting these species, often in conjunction with efforts under CITES. In the 110 th Congress, P.L. 110-132 reauthorized the African Elephant Conservation Act and the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act of 1994 through FY2012. Other bills were introduced to deal with international concerns. H.R. 1464 would have amended the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 to extend protection to plants illegally harvested outside of the United States. H.r. 4455 would have authorized. the sale of illegal plants in the U.S. to other countries. The bill was reported (amended) by the House Committee on Natural Resources on September 24, 2008 ( H.Rept. 110-882 ) and passed the House of Representatives on May 21, 2008. The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works reported H. R. 1771 ( S. rept.110-493 ) on September 23, 2008, and passed it on September 25, 2008; the House passed the bill on May 20, 2008 and May 21. the Secretary of the Interior to provide international wildlife management and conservation programs through FWS's Wildlife Without Borders Program. H.R. 5756 and S. 3490 would have reauthorized the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act through FY2015. S.Res. 598 expressed the sense of the Senate regarding the need for the United States to lead international efforts to assist developing nations in preventing the extinction of a large portion of the world's plant and animal species. The answer to this question depends on what is measured. Since a major goal of ESA is the recovery of species to the point at which ESA protection. 48 U.S. and foreign species or distinct population segments thereof have been delisted. Recovered species include alligators, Yellowstone grizzly bear, bald eagle, brown pelican, peregrine falcons (two subspecies), and three species of kangaroos. ESA reauthorization has been on the legislative agenda since the funding authorization expired in 1992. Issues for the 110 th Congress included effects of ESA on private and federal land use, promotion of species recovery, agency use of scientific information, specific regional resource conflicts. several recent situations, legal, economic, and social disputes have resulted from actions under ESA. Examples of these controversies include the Florida panther, Klamath River Basin suckers and coho salmon, and Sonoran Desert bald eagles. Critics in some of these disputes suggest that the science supporting ESA action has been insufficiently rigorous or mishandled by the agencies. What should be done in such instances? Some suggest that considerations other than species conservation should prevail; others seek to change the current posture of the law by changing the role of ESA.  ESA does not elaborate on this question, but some assert that, given the protective purpose of ESA, arguably dwindling species are to be given the benefit of the doubt and a margin of safety. These considerations are complicated by the costs and time required to acquire more complete data, particularly in connection with many lesser-known species. This phrase is drawn from H.Rept. 96-697, p. 12 (1979), which states that the "best information available" language should be used. In the 110 th Congress, the House Committee on Natural Resources held an oversight hearing on political influence and scientific integrity in ESA implementation. H.R. 3459 would have amended ESA to require FWS to publish a summary statement of the scientific basis for a listing or delisting decision or the designation of CH. "Best scientific and commercial data available" is not a standard of absolute certainty, reflecting Congress's intent that FWS take conservation measures before a species is conclusively headed for extinction. The Department of the Interior and FWS have both issued additional guidelines that are available through their websites. In the absence of federal regulatory action on climate change, environmental groups are eyeing use of the Endangered Species Act. The idea is to petition FWS and NMFS to list as endangered or threatened various animals whose habitat is or will be adversely affected by climate change. Once listed, the argument would be made that sources of substantial greenhouse gas emissions, such as coal-fired powerplants, cause an unlawful "take" of these species under ESA Section 9. This could force negotiation of an incidental take permit for the source. S. 1554 would have amended the Clean Air Act to provide funding for programs and projects conserving habitat for endangered species and species of conservation concern. H.R. 3221 would have allocated funds to the FWS endangered species programs and to related funds to assist species adaptation to climate change. S. 3071 would have temporarily prohibit the Secretary of the Interior from considering global climate change as a natural or manmade factor in determining whether a species is a threatened or endangered species. As open space dwindles and increasing human populations put pressures on wildlands and natural resources, efforts at conserving species and their habitats may highlight underlying resource crises and economic conflicts. Controversy erupted in 2001 when the Bureau of Reclamation announced it would not release water from part of its Klamath irrigation project. The operational change sought to make more water available for three fish species under ESA protection. A proposed agreement has been drafted to address conflicting water management objectives. The parties to this proposed agreement have indicated that, if the agreement is finalized, they will seek legislative support from Congress. In 2007, the hatchery listing policy of NMFS was ruled invalid by a federal court in part because the court found it scientifically questionable to include hatchery-raised fish. S. 3608 would have established a Salmon Stronghold Partnership program to protect wild Pacific salmon. Delta smelt ( Hypomesus transpacificus ) is a small, slender-bodied fish found only in the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento-San Joaquin Rivers Delta in California. The species was listed as threatened under ESA in 1993 and, in recent years, species abundance has declined to the lowest ever observed. This provision was not retained in P.L. 110-161 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008. Delta smelt decline has significant consequences for the operation of the Central Valley Project (CVP) and the State Water Project (SWP) Some contend that entrainment in water pumps is the primary cause, whereas others argue that all causes might be more or less equally responsible for the observed decline. To address the decline, changes in how these pumps are operated might be required to satisfy ESA requirements. These requirements could result in reduced pumping and less water for users. The decline of the Delta smelt has been documented since the 1970s. impact of pumping on Delta smelt, an ESA Section 7 consultation between FWS and the Bureau was conducted. FWS issued a no-jeopardy biological opinion (BiOp) in 2004, and re-issued the BiOp in 2005 to address potential critical habitat issues. In May 2007, the FWS BiOp was found not to comply with ESA with regard to DeltaSmelt. The Bureau and FWS reinitiated consultation based on new information on the Delta Smelt in 2007. H.R. 6940 would have authorized support for the establishment of a fish hatchery program. District Court for the Western District of Washington overturned the pesticide counterpart regulations. The court let stand the "optional formal consultation" process, in which NMFS or FWS can adopt EPA effects determinations as their own. A report by the services of the NFP counterpart regulations found that all ten projects reviewed by NMFS were deficient in five or six criteria. 44 out of 50 projects review by FWS missed at least one of six criteria, with 19 missing all six. The prohibitions in Section 9 (private actions) and Section 7 (federal nexus) at times frustrate the economic desires of owners of land. assert that restrictions under ESA routinely "take" property in the constitutional sense of the term. Conflicts between ESA and property owners come about despite the existence of ESA mechanisms intended to soften its impact on property owners. Critics want ESA amended to afford compensation for a broader range of property impacts than the Constitution provides. The 110 th Congress enacted P.L. 110-229 , including Section 515 authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to participate in the Platte River Recovery Implementation Program for Endangered Species. June 20, 2007, as "American Eagle Day," to celebrate the recovery and restoration of the American bald eagle. On June 18, 2008, the House agreed to H.Res. 1247 , supporting the goals and ideals of "American eagle Day" The 110 th Congress considered a variety of additional ESA issues, although none were enacted. Section 901 of S. 1892 would have required a Coast Guard report on efforts taken from FY2000 through 2007 to protect endangered sea turtles and marine mammals; the Senate Committee on Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation reported on February 5, 2008. on whether to list polar bears as threatened. H.R. 6936 would have amended the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) to allow importing polar bear trophies taken in Canadian sport hunts before the polar bear was listed as a threatened species. S.Res. 520 would have designated May 16, 2008, as "Endangered Species Day" S. Res. 583 would have declared June 20, 2008,. as "American Eagle Day," to celebrate recovery and restoration of the bald eagle. The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation reported (amended) S. 2657. President Bush signed P.L. 110-161 ( H.R. 2764 ) into law, providing more than $236 million for FWS's ESA and related programs. On February 4, 2008, the Bush Administration released its FY2009 budget request, including over $230 million for ESA-related programs withing FWS. The FY2009 request for ESA program funding for F WS under their Ecological Services Account is $3.67 million (2.44%) less than funding enacted for FY2008.

Summary:
Forecasting future retirement income needs is a challenge, in part because of the many variables involved. Social Security is the primary source of income for many retirees. Private pensions and other sources of income serve as key supplements and help retirees receive adequate income in retirement. Estimates of future income adequacy rely heavily on projections of macroeconomic factors, including estimates of future rates of inflation, and rates of return on stocks and bonds and changes in home values. The federal government collects a great deal of data pertinent to the analysis of retirement income and wealth. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-13) and similar previous legislation is designed to minimize the paperwork burden on the public. The act requires OMB to approve all existing and new collections of information by federal agencies. In approving agency collection efforts, OMB must weigh the burden to the public against the practical utility of the information to the agency. Panel members noted that efforts to reduce existing data collection requirements sometimes result in.a reduction in the overall response rate. Several laws exist to protect individuals’ rights to privacy and protect the confidentiality of personal and proprietary information held by federal agencies. Law requires federal agencies to restrict access to data they collect. Survey shows people are apprehensive about the government’s use of personal information. Public distrust of federal agencies’ use of their personal information can undermine people’S willingness to participate in federal surveys, potentially making the information collected less reliable, the authors say. The authors say lower response rates can undermine analysts’ statistical projections. agencies and researchers continue to explore options to maximize data usefulness without compromising respondent privacy and confidentiality. The Census Bureau has received permission from the IRS to link the survey records to additional items from IRS and SSA records. More sophisticated techniques include the use of methods to substitute artificial artificial values for the actual value of a respondent’s income. In this way, so many individuals are included in the high-income group that their identities cannot be determined, the Census Bureau says. It has recently increased the number of its research data centers where approved analysts can access confidential data. In December 2002, the Congress enacted the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act of 2002. This act permits designated statistical agencies to share information concerning businesses for statistical purposes, but not information concerning individuals or households. It authorizes three agencies—the Census Bureau, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and BLS—to share data on businesses with one another. Pension experts state that this method can only accommodate certain kinds of variables and, therefore, complex relationships between variables may not be maintained. This allows people to remain anonymous to the researchers using the data. With the proportion of retirees to workers expected to increase dramatically over the next couple of decades, important decisions lie ahead. Access to retirement income data needed to inform those decisions has actually decreased in some respects, the authors say. While improvements in data are essential for more reliable forecasts of retirement income, protecting respondents’ information and minimizing the burden data collection efforts impose on firms and individuals are also crucial. Finding an appropriate balance between providing wider access to data to support policy analysis and keeping data secure is a persistent and evolving challenge. panel and modified the draft as appropriate in response to their comments. Commerce had no major comments on the report (see app. VI). Labor agreed on the need for access to accurate data but did not agree with our recommendations to the Secretary of Labor. Regarding our recommendation to collect electronic copies of SPDs, Labor concluded that this is at odds with the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which eliminated requirements that SPDs be regularly filed with Labor. Labor also indicated that there was little public interest in the SPDs. In both 1993 and 1995 we supported elimination of paper filing requirements. We continue to believe that it is time to phase in a requirement that SPDs be filed electronically. The costs involved should be considerably less than those incurred filing and storing paper copies. Labor estimated in 1998, for example, that it would cost an average of $1.55 to provide SPDs for health benefit plans to each plan participant. The need for improvements in retirement income data warrants renewed efforts to address the priorities identified by experts we consulted. the confidentiality of survey data may hamper wider access to SPDs. BLS assures respondents to its National Compensation Survey that their identities will be kept confidential. Arrangements could be developed through which BLS and other statistical agencies could both obtain SPDs and protect the identity of respondents. They could, for example, request SPDs from a larger number of employers without identifying which employers were being surveyed. This is the kind of improved access to data that we envisioned BLS could take. We conclude that the need for improvements in retirement income data warrants Labor's use of its existing authority. GAO conducted a Web based survey of experts in the field. The report will be available at no charge on the GAO’s Web site at http://www.gao.gov/. If you have any questions concerning this report, please contact Barbara Bovbjerg at (202) 512-7215. See appendix VIII for other contacts and staff acknowledgments. The questionnaire asked respondents to indicate the priority (from highest to lowest) they would place on 22 actions to improve retirement income data. Respondents were asked to rate each action independently. informed participants of its availability. This E-mail message also contained a unique user name and password that allowed each respondent to log on and fill out his or her own questionnaire. As of December 12, 2002, 190 of the experts responded to the survey (a 69% response rate). Eighteen percent of respondents indicated that they were affiliated with federal agencies, about half were affiliated. with colleges and universities, 24 percent were affiliatedwith other nonprofit organizations, and the remaining 9 percent were. affiliated with for profit or other organizations. Existing panel surveys of middle-aged and older people should receive continued government support. Longitudinal data from these surveys are essential to analyze retirement and savings decisions. These surveys should be refreshed periodically with new cohorts in order to offer insight into how behavior changes over time. The amounts of federal support for three major longitudinal surveys have been sustained. The scope of our work did not include an evaluation of estimated costs and benefits of specific proposals for improving retirement income data. We did not independently verify the federal funding figures provided to us by longitudinal survey administrators or agencies sponsoring the surveys. on housing and medical care. Such consumption measures are important for projections of economic well being in retirement. Labor’s Consumer Expenditure Survey provides cross-sectional rather than longitudinal data on many types of expenditures. Panel surveys of younger people, such as the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), should include detailed questionnaire modules. The proposed American Community Survey also would provide limited detail on housing expenditures. The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) provides extensive data on medical expenditures. on pension coverage, wealth, health status, and retirement- and savings-related expectations. Such information is needed to fully understand life-cycle behavior and to track the disparities in income and wealth that are evident by middle age. The NLSY asks about the total amount of retirement savings, amounts contributed, and amounts withdrawn, and pension coverage. It also provides information about assets and debt and limited information about health (height, weight, and general evaluation of health), but not retirement or savings expectations. The 1991 and 1995-99 rounds of the survey included more detailed questions on amounts in retirement plans. The bracketing technique used in HRS and AHEAD that has been demonstrated to reduce nonresponse to important items should be adopted in other surveys. Federal agencies collaborate through entities such as the Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics. The National Institute on Aging should facilitate such collaborative efforts. The Census Bureau and other statistical agencies seek comments from a wide range of researchers on the content of questions. SIPP Working Group, which consists of federal and non-federal analysts, both advise the Census Bureau on that survey. Labor should establish an interagency task force on employer data to specify an integrated plan for collecting retirement income-related information. The plan should specify short-term and long-term goals that consider user needs, resource constraints, and the problems of obtaining information from employers. According to officials at the Department’s EBSA, Labor has not made this a priority because its resources are limited. distribution across employers of all benefit plan offerings. Comprehensive baseline information is a priority need, along with a plan for regular updating. Needed data elements include benefit plan characteristics and costs, employer characteristics (e.g., number of employees, financial characteristics, wage structure) for public and private employers and the self-employed. Recommendation: The employer data collection task force should give priority to redesigning and enhancing existing data collection systems on employer benefit offerings and related topics. The Employee Benefits Survey (now part of the National Compensation Survey) continues to provide data for categories of employers, not categories of employees. BLS has begun providing aggregate estimates for all private employers. However, the survey does not cover federal, military, agricultural, fishing, forestry, or private household employers. Data from IRS Form 5500 continues to become available well after the end of the reporting year. For example, for a firm with a 1998 reporting year beginning December 15, 1998, and ending December 14, 1999, the Form 5 500 was due July 31, 2000. Labor takes several months to review and edit the returns before making them public. researchers and policy analysts, but its Web site does not include links to the data. A private firm provides a Web site with images of the completed forms, but not compiled data sets. Linking these consolidated reports of publicly held companies with Form 5500 data is difficult because these reports can cover only parts of a company, more than one company, or privately held companies. Labor no longer requires that it receives the summary plan descriptions regularly, and as a result the public no longer has access rights to new or revised versions. more data on labor demand for older workers Recommendation: The employer data collection plan should include short-term and long-term goals. Needed data elements include employment patterns of older workers, compensation and benefit costs by age, and worker productivity by age. The Health and Retirement Study and other surveys provide much data on employment patterns and salary and wages of older Workers. But little has been done, however, concerning compensation and benefits costs or productivity by Age. The employerDataCollection.org website can be accessed at: http://www.datacollection.org/. force should consider the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of a panel survey that collects detailed information on employers and their workers. Such a survey should cover the full universe, including private for profit, nonprofit, and government employers, and the self- employed. Longitudinal data from an employer-based survey are needed to analyze the factors that affect employer decisions about recruitment and retention of older workers. The E-Government Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-347) could provide for linking National Compensation Survey (NCS) data on retirement plans to the Census Bureau’s data on business establishments. Access to linked data sets remains quite limited. Possible solutions include: (1) developing public use files that contain summary variables derived from the administrative records portion of the matched file. (2) requiring researchers to sign nondisclosure agreements with significant penalties for violations; and (3) providing researchers with access to matched files on site at secure data centers.of individual responses. Access to HRS linked data for example, is typically made available via a rigorous application process resulting in a data use agreement with the University of Michigan. extend access to our restricted data. Use data centers, which provide access to restricted information, for approved researchers. Fund regular evaluation of data quality for retirement income-related surveys. Several studies using the recommended methods have been conducted, with mixed results. The Census Bureau conducted a study comparing estimates of various types of 1990-96 incomes in SIPP and CPS to each other. The study was conducted by the Census Bureau and the National Center for Health Statistics, which is part of the National Institutes of Health. benchmark data estimated by the Census Bureau from the personal income estimates in the National Income and Product Accounts. For 1996, the aggregate wages and salary estimate based on CPS survey data was 102 percent of the benchmark based on administrative records. In contrast, the study found more substantial disparities for several other types of income. For most income brackets, however, the data match quite well, according to the study. The study is being replicated with data for 1999. The Department of Treasury’s Office of Tax Analysis has compared estimates of pension plan participation and contributions with Census Bureau survey data. The Census Bureau periodically assesses the quality of CPS data by reinterviewing a subsample of respondents. The Census Bureau has also studied the accuracy of respondent data by matching income data in the March CPS with selected income detail on individual IRS income tax returns and SSA earnings and benefit records. HRS investigators have compared employee responses about retirement income to employer provided data and Social Security records and found wide discrepancies. It is unclear to what extent these result from respondents’ responses. A similar effort is underway using 1999 data. limited knowledge of their pensions or data errors.

Summary:
On December 16, 2014, the President signed into law the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of FY2015 ( P.L. 113-235 ), which included $3.066 billion for the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. The CDBG program is the federal government's largest and most widely available source of financial assistance supporting state and local government-directed neighborhood revitalization, housing rehabilitation, and economic development activities. The Obama Administration's budget request for FY2015 included $2.870 billion for activities funded under HUD's CDF account.  RIPIGs would have been competitively awarded to states, counties, metropolitan regions, and cities to support metropolitan-wide housing, transportation, economic development, energy, and land use planning. The Administration again proposed the creation of Project Rebuild, a $15 billion program that would build upon the success of the Neighborhood Stabilization Initiative. This was envisioned as a multi-agency initiative involving the Department of Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other federal agencies. It was the same amount requested, but not funded, in the FY2014 appropriations cycle. The CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program allows states and entitlement communities to borrow up to five times their annual allocation for a term of 20 years. The Administration's budget proposed a loan commitment ceiling of $500 million in FY2015. FY2015 marked the first year the program charged a fee to access the program rather than provide a credit subsidy. The fee-based requirement to use the program, which was created by Congress, is expected to be lifted in the coming months. The program is designed to help communities affected by the mortgage foreclosure crisis acquire, rehabilitate, demolish and resell abandoned and foreclosed residential properties.  HUD published two notices regarding the Section 108 fees in the Federal Register. The first of the two established a fee of 2.42% of the principal obligation of the loan, which will be applied to Section 108 loan disbursements during FY2015. The second notice included proposed rules that would govern the levying of fees when appropriations for credit subsidies are not available or insufficient in future years. The department set March 9, 2015, as the due date for comments on the proposed regulation.was first floated by the Administration in its FY2010 budget request, was not approved by Congress until the FY2014 appropriations. On December 16, 2014, the President signed into law the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act ( P.L. 113-235 ), which included appropriations for the Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD) The bill appropriated $45.4 billion in gross discretionary appropriations, including $3.66 billion for CDBG activities. Of the amount appropriated $3 billion is to be allocated to CDBG. The House approved an amendment that would have prohibited HUD from terminating the CDBG entitlement status of any community. The $3 billion CDBG formula grants appropriation represents a 7% increase above the Administration's request and a 1% decline below the $3.030 billion appropriated for FY2014. The act also set aside $66 million for the Indian CDBG (ICDBG) program. Of the amount set aside for ICDBG projects, $6 million was to be made available to undertake mold remediation and prevention in Indian housing. P.L. 113-235 also supported a fee-based loan commitment ceiling of $500. The act continued funding of capacity building activities, but under a separate account. P.L. 113-235 did not support the Administration's request to transfer the Section 4 program from its current account to a new stand-alone account. The act also included CDBG-related provisions included in House or Senate bills, including a provision prohibiting a community from exchanging or transferring its CDBG allocation to another community in exchange for non-CDBG funds. It did not appropriate funding for the administration's Neighborhood Stabilization Initiative proposal. use of CDF funds for Economic Development Initiative and Neighborhood Initiative projects. Last funded in FY2010, these are two programs that had been used exclusively for congressional earmarks. In addition, FY2015 CDF appropriations were not to be used to fund projects under the Rural Innovation Fund, or discretionary activities authorized under 42 U.S.C. §5307. The Obama Administration's budget request for FY2014 included $3.143 billion for activities funded under HUD's CDF account. The requested amount represented 6.6% of the $47.6 billion in budget authority requested by the agency. 112 th Congress) noted that the SCI was unauthorized and did not have the support of the committee of jurisdiction, the House Financial Services Committee. Instead, the bill recommended just over $2 million in HUD's Management and Administration account for activities related to the closeout and evaluation of previously awarded SCI awards. In response to the mortgage foreclosure crisis that began to unfold in 2007, Congress passed a series of measures intended to assist states and local governments address the growing inventory of abandoned and foreclosed residential properties. The proposal would have allowed funds to be used for activities such as acquisition, demolition, clearance, and land banking. The CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program (Section 108) allows states and entitlement communities to collateralize their annual CDBG allocation. Communities may borrow up to five times their annual allocation for a term of 20 years through the public issuance of bonds. The proceeds from the bonds must be used to finance activities that support job creation and that meet one of the national goals of the CDBG program. yields on U.S. Treasury obligations of similar maturity to the principal amount. The Administration proposed revamping the program by charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers accessing the program. This proposal was first made by the Administration in its FY2010 budget request, but it has been rejected by Congress. The HUD proposal would have allowed loan guarantee borrowers to fold the proposed fee into the loan guarantee amount or to use CDBG funds to pay the fee. The proposal was made in the Administration's FY2013 budget request. On January 17, 2014, President Obama signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2014, P.L. 113-76. The bill recommended $3.295 billion for activities funded under the CDF account. The House Appropriations Committee reported the THUD Appropriations Act on July 2, 2013. H.R. 2610 would have appropriated $10 million less than the $70 million recommended by the Senate or requested by the Administration for Indian tribes. It did not include language supporting an Administration proposal that would have established a minimum CDBG allocation. The act does continue funding of Section 4 (Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing) activities at $35 million. The act does not support transferring the program from its current account, the Self-Help and Homeownership Opportunity account, to a new stand-alone account, as requested by the Administration. Nor did the act include language supporting the Administration's proposal that would have established a minimum CDBG allocation. HUD is directed to develop rules governing the imposition of a fee-based assessment to borrowers accessing the program, which would eliminate the need for an appropriated credit subsidy. million be set aside to provide technical support for the development of a residential energy modeling system. The Administration's budget proposed doubling the program's loan commitment ceiling from $240 million in FY2012 to $500 million inFY2013. The proposed increase in funding will help local governments finance large-scale job creation activities. In addition to an increase in the loan. commitment ceiling, the Administration proposed revamping the program by charging a fee-based. assessment to borrowers accessing the program, which. would be charged a fee. would have eliminated the need for an appropriated credit subsidy. The House bill did not support the Administration's budget request calling for the conversion of Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based structure. H.R. 5972 did not include a set-aside of CDBG funds to support a new round of funding for SCI activities. The bill recommended just over $2 million in the Management and Administration account for activities related to the closeout and evaluation of previously awarded SCI awards. The 113 th Congress took up the task of completing the FY2013 appropriations process. On March 6, 2013, the House approved H.R. 933 , a bill providing full-year, government-wide appropriations for FY2013. The bill proposed continuing funding for the CDF account, including CDBG formula grants, at the FY2012 levels, reduced by an across-the-board rescission of .098% and proposed maintaining the funding reductions imposed by the sequester. The President signed into law P.L. 113-6 , the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013. a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to develop a federal deficit reduction plan for enactment by January 15, 2012. On January 2, 2013, the President signed the American Taxpayer Relief Act, P.L. 112-240 , (ATRA), which averted scheduled income tax rate increases and postponed spending reductions required by the sequestration process. According to the Office of Management and Budget, sequestration has resulted in an $85 billion reduction in FY2013 discretionary spending, including a 5% reduction in funding for CDF activities.

Summary:
The FSM, the Marshall Islands, and Palau are among the smallest countries in the world. In 2008, the three FAS had a combined resident population of approximately 179,000. In 1947, the United States entered into a trusteeship with the United Nations and became the administering authority of the three nations. The four states of the FSM voted in 1978 to become an independent nation. The Marshall Islands established a constitutional government and declared itself a republic in 1979. In 1994, Palau also entered a Compact of Free Association with the U.S. and became a nation. a sovereign state. Under the compacts, FAS citizens are exempt from meeting the visa and labor certification requirements of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) as amended. The compacts provide the United States with exclusive military use rights in these countries. A further compact-related agreement with the Marshall Islands secured the U.S. military facilities on Kwajalein Atoll, which are used for missile testing and space tracking activities. In the 1986 compacts’ enabling legislation, Congress stated that it had a responsibility for the defense of the FAS. was not its intent to cause any adverse consequences for United States territories and commonwealths and the state of Hawaii. Congress declared that it would act sympathetically and expeditiously to redress any adverse consequence. The legislation also required the President to report and make recommendations annually to the Congress regarding adverse consequences resulting from the compact and provide statistics on compact migration. In December 2003, Congress approved the amended compacts with the FSM and the Marshall Islands and took steps in the amendedcompacts’ enabling legislation to address compact migrant impact in U.S. areas. The legislation restated Congress’s intent not to cause any adverse consequences for the areas defined as affected jurisdictions—Guam, Hawaii, the CNMI, and American Samoa. The act authorized and appropriated $30 million for each fiscal year from 2004 to 2023 for grants to the affected jurisdictions. Grants are to be used only for health, educational, social, or public safety services, or infrastructure related to such services. Under the initial compacts with the FSM and the Marshall Islands, the United States provided $2.1 billion in economic assistance to these governments. The amended compacts require that the sector grants be targeted to sectors such as education, health care, the environment, public sector capacity building, private sector development, and public infrastructure. The U.S.-Federated States of Micronesia Joint Economic Management Committee and the U.s.-Republic of the Republic of the Pacific Economic Cooperation have been established. the Marshall Islands Joint Economic Management and Financial Accountability Committee. Census has gathered data through multiple efforts that can be used to describe aspects of the FAS migration to U.S. areas. Data are currently available through Census’s decennial censuses and its American Community Survey (ACS) In addition, under agreements with Interior, Census has conducted special enumerations of compact migrants in affected jurisdictions, such as the Marshall Islands and Puerto Rico. Figure 1 shows the locations of FAS and the affected jurisdictions. The 2010 decennial census in the 50 states is a 10-question survey that gathers limited demographic data such as sex, age, and race. Census does not collect respondents’ place of birth or year of entry, both of which are needed to identify compact migrants. Interior has conducted four sets of enumerations of compact migrants in affected jurisdictions. In 2008, the two-pronged approach cost approximately $1.3 million, including headquarters and field costs and the cost of final reporting. The government of Arkansas stated that it had serious doubts about the accuracy of the ACS estimate for Arkansas shown in figure 2. According to these estimates, although the FSM produced the highest number of migrants, Marshallese predominated in Arizona, Arkansas, California, and Washington. Census has also published the 2010 decennial census counts of Pacific Islanders, with respondents identifying themselves by race, for the 50 U.S. states. Decennial census data include published state-level information on the Marshallese population. The two-pronged 2008 enumeration had certain strengths and limitations. The data produced by block sampling in Guam and the CNMI and the ACS tabulations in Hawaii are not fully comparable among the affected jurisdictions. The shift in approaches from prior enumerations to 2008 limits Interior’s and affected jurisdictions’ ability to draw inferences from trends in the data. Hawaii expressed concern that the use of ACS data for the state from earlier years would not reflect recent migration and, in contrast to the special survey to be conducted in Guam, would eliminate Hawaii's local input into the survey. Officials in all three affected jurisdictions remained dissatisfied with the 2008 enumeration approach. Interior cited Census’s independence as an advantage of its conducting the enumerations. The preliminary approach would use data from April 1, 2010 for Guam and the CNMI and from multiple ACS monthly samples at different points in time for Hawaii. Detailed demographic data could be produced for compact migrants in Guam and CNMI, because the 2010 decennial census in those locations collected such data. However, as in 2008, demographic data from the ACS in Hawaii could lack statistical reliability. For 2004 through 2010, the affected jurisdictions’ reports to Interior show more than $1 billion in costs for services related to compact migrants. Education accounted for the largest share of reported expenses in all three jurisdictions. The CNMI’s reported costs decreased by approximately 53 percent, reflecting the decline in the CNMI compact migrant population. Compact migrant school children generally lag academically owing to poor-quality schools in the FAS and limited language skills and experience with a school environment. The affected jurisdictions reported impact costs for educational, health, public safety and social services. have high rates of obesity; diabetes; hypertension; cardiovascular disease; and communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, Hansen’s disease, and sexually transmitted diseases. In U.S. areas, compact migrants’ low household incomes may lead many migrants to rely on public health services. States and territories receive federal funding for specific programs that offsets a portion of the costs of providing services to compact migrants. Two of the three affected jurisdictions’ public school systems and health agencies did not account for these offsets in their impact reporting. Compact migrants participate in local economies through taxation, but reliable data quantifying their effect are not available. Compact migrants contribute to the local economy by consuming local goods and services and by spending remittances that they receive from their home islands. From fiscal years 2004 through 2010, the $30 million in annual compact impact grants have addressed a portion of each jurisdiction’s reported impact costs. Of the $210 million in impact grants, approximately $102 million was provided to Guam, $75 million to Hawaii, and $33 million to the CNMI (see fig. 6). In their compact impact reports to Interior, the governors of Guam and Hawaii have highlighted the gaps between their reported impact Costs and the amounts of the compact impact Grants. Migrants in Guam and Hawaii identified language and cultural issues as a source of difficulty in using government services. Guam officials noted the need for interpreters to assist patients and families. Hawaii officials identified lack of coordination of services as a challenge. Several compact migrants in Hawaii suggested the establishment of a community center to help people adjust to life in the U.S. Have a more effective long-term impact? Share your story with CNN iReport. Share your photos, videos, and other content. In 2001, we reported that targeting assistance to the health and education sectors in the FSM and the Marshall Islands might lessen compact migration. In 2011, the committees formally placed compact impact on their annual meeting agendas. As of September 2011 they had not allocated 2012 sector grant funding to directly address issues that concern the compact migrants or the affected jurisdictions. We found some examples of grants that directly address compact migrants’ needs in affected jurisdictions and thus respond to some of some of theaffected jurisdictions’ concerns. The compact migrant population represents a tiny fraction of migrants in the United States. The population can have significant impacts on the U.S. communities where they reside. To help defray costs of providing services to compact migrants, Congress has appropriated compact impact funds. We recommend that the Secretary of the Interior take the following four actions: work with the affected jurisdictions to evaluate the current use of grant funds and consider alternative uses of these grants to reduce compact impact. In order to help mitigate compact impact and. better assist FSM and Marshall Islands citizens who migrate to the United. States, work. with the U-FSM and U-S.-Marshall Islands joint management committees to consider uses of sector grants that would address FSM. and Marshallese migrants. Census did not comment on our report’s recommendations but offered a number of largely technical comments on our findings. Census disagreed with our assessment of the limitations of the 2008 enumeration methodologies. The government of Hawaii generally agreed with our recommendations and made several related observations. Guam agreed in principle to the four recommendations in our report. Our report notes the authorization of additional appropriations but does not address limits on migration. We added a note to the report to describe the debt relief provision but also note that it expired on February 28, 2005. our findings and recommendations and stated that Interior should consult with the CNMI on developing cost guidance based on Interior Inspector General, Office of Management and Budget, and GAO guidance. The government of Arkansas generally agreed with our findings but expressed serious reservations about the ACS data shown in figure 2 of our report. We agree that there are differences between the counts and list some of the reasons for the differences in appendix IV. We have added additional text to the report body to present Arkansas’s concerns and more thoroughly describe them. This report describes migration to U.S. areas from the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), the Marshall Islands, and Palau under those countries’ compacts of free association with the United States. It reviews approaches to enumerating these compact migrants; evaluates reporting of these migrant’s impact on Guam, Hawaii, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) In addition, appendix II provides information on the growing Marshallese compact migrant population in Arkansas and its impact. If you or your staffs have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-3149. compile the compact impact costs reported by the governments of Guam, Hawaii, and the CNMI. We used the most recent data that they submitted to Interior for 1986 through 2010. We then categorized the reported costs using the categories that the amended compacts’ enabling legislation defines as eligible for compact impact funding. We reviewed the narrative of the reports submitted by affected jurisdictions and interviewed compact migrants and officials in affected jurisdictions.. To identify the eligibility of compact migrants for selected federal programs that may help address the compact. impact on affected jurisdictions, we reviewed existing legislation. Hawaii’s Department of Human Services, Department of Health, and Department of Education said that their reporting methodologies had generally not changed since their last report, which was submitted in 2008. However, the Department of education said that it excluded federal funds from its 2008 through 2011 compact impact costs and corrected its reporting error regarding the number of compact students for 2006 through 2008. In addition, the Tuberculosis Branch changed its methodology and the Family Health Services Division changed its presentation of the data. Guam and the CNMI for programs serving compact migrants. We analyzed single audit reports from 2005 through 2009 in CNMI and from 2004 through 2008 in Guam. To assess Interior’s guidelines on compact impact reporting, we reviewed the requirements contained in the amended compacts’ enabling legislation. To describe compact migrants’ participation in local economies, we generally used data from the Micronesian surveys in Micronesia.. We assessed the 2010 report to Congress against the specific elements required in the legislation. 1997 and 2003 as reported in the 2008 report of the 2003 survey, supplementing these data where possible with additional information from local and natio nal agencies and other literature. To determine whether additional data on the compact migrants’ role in the economy exist, we contacted agencies from affected jurisdictions that address labor and taxation. We analyzed data from the CNMI Department of Finance for 2001 through 2009, comparing the size of the compact migrant labor force to the overall CNMI labor force. We compared the income of compact migrants to that of the general population. We used data from the 2008 and 2009 Guam Annual Census of Establishments. We also compared the amount of taxes paid by compact migrants with the amount paid by the general population in Guam. The method we used to prepare this estimate drew on a method first outlined by an official in the Guam Bureau of Statistics and Plans. We analyzed data from Inter- American Dialogue, the fiscal year 2008 Economic Reviews of the FSM and the Marshall Islands, and data reported in the 2008 Guam Statistical Yearbook. report of the 2003 survey. To determine the number of FAS-born persons serving in the U.S. armed forces, we requested a special tabulation from the Department of Defense’s Active Duty Personnel Master and Reserve Components Common Personnel Data System. We assessed the management of the grants against the legislation and manual for Guam, Hawaii, and the CNMI for fiscal years 2004 through 2011. In each grant file, we reviewed grant narratives and correspondence and collected the grant name, number, amount, description, status, remaining balance, and purpose. as well as any funding redirections or deobligations. Arkansas’s compact migrant population is almost exclusively from the Marshall Islands and is concentrated in the rapidly growing northwest Arkansas counties of Benton and Washington. The 2010 decennial census reports that 4,324 persons in Arkansas responding to the race question on the 2010 form identified themselves as Marshallese. In 2009 and 2010, the Springdale School District reported that 1,323 and 1,579 students identified as Pacific Islanders when enrolling in Springdale schools. tutoring and employs two Marshallese translators. The Washington County Department of Health dedicates four staff to its Marshallese Outreach Team. The Jones Center for Families, a nonprofit community service organization, employs a Marshallese Community Outreach Coordinator. The Gaps in Services to Marshallese Task Force, a network of interested individuals headed by a retired Jones Center employee, has used grants from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Arkansas Minority Health Commission to survey the health concerns of Marshallese. Arkansas does not collect data on a number of costs reported by Guam, Hawaii, and the CNMI. Arkansas estimated costs for health services to compact migrants by compiling costs for the population identified as of Pacific Islander ethnicity. Arkansas does not track the use of some state-funded services by ethnicity and therefore could not estimate the costs of providing these services to Compact migrants. Only FAS consulate in the continental U.S. only provides data on compact impact on the state of Arkansas. The estimated education service costs are for the Springdale School District, where most Marshallese school children live. stated that compact migrants are eligible for programs such as the state’s Division of Developmental Disabilities Services. Unlike affected jurisdictions, Arkansas does not provide Medicaid equivalent services to noncitizen compact migrants. Marshallese fill a significant niche in the local poultry industry. According to employers in northwest Arkansas, Marshallese represent between 14 and 37.9 percent of the total workforce at some plants of major poultry producers, such as Tyson, Cargill, and George's. Arkansas doesn't disaggregate tax revenue by ethnic categories or citizenship and there are no data on consumption and remittances. The 2010 decennial census identified 22,434 Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islanders who identified themselves specifically as Marshallese residing in the 50 U.S. states. The largest Marshallese populations were in Hawaii, Arkansas, and Washington. The 2010 census reported 7,412 Marshallese in Hawaii and 4,324 in Arkansas, while the ACS tabulation estimates 3,535 and 1,150 Marshallese compact migrants inHawaii and Arkansas, respectively. The census counts are not meant to be compared with ACS 5 year estimates of compact migrants. Best practices and guidance state that cost estimations should be characterized by accuracy, adequate documentation, and comprehensiveness. Estimates should contain few errors and reflect actual costs. Cost estimates should include a detailed description of the derivation of the reported costs, such as the source data used, the calculations performed and their results. We found a number of limitations affecting reported costs’ credibility and preventing a precise calculation of total compact impact on the affected jurisdictions, the authors said. The report was published by the International Institute of Fiscal Studies. Several local government reporting agencies that responded to our inquiries did not define compact migrants according to the criteria in the amended compacts’ enabling legislation. The legislation defines the population to be enumerated as persons, or those persons’ children under the age of 18, who pursuant to the compacts are admitted to, or resident in, an affected jurisdiction as of the date of the most recently published enumeration. By counting compact migrants based on their ethnicity or language, agencies may have overcounted. By identifying compact migrants by their citizenship, agencies might have undercounted, because they would have excluded compact migrants.  Guam, Hawaii, and the CNMI, among other U.S. states and territories, receive federal funding for programs that compact migrants use. Many local government agencies estimated impact costs based on average, rather than specific, costs of providing services to compact migrants. Guam received an annual average of $1,027,825 from HHS for the Consolidated Health Centers program, an amount based partly on the number of beneficiaries in Guam. For example, the Hawaii Department of Education included language training costs in its reported per pupil expenditures. The Department of the Interior did not agree with our recommendation that it work with affected jurisdictions to evaluate the current use of compact impact grant funds and consider alternative uses. Currently, limited FSM compact grant funds are being used to support worker training in Guam, addressing a concern of compact migrants in Guam as well as the Guam government. According to the Center for Micronesian Empowerment, approximately 45 percent of its trainees in Guam are compact migrants residing in Guam. We agree with Interior that the sector grants listed in the compacts are to support the governments of the FSM and the Marshall Islands. use of funds and consider alternatives uses. We found that government officials, service providers, and compact migrants in the affected jurisdictions identified a significant need for language and cultural assistance, job training, and improved access to basic services. This may also help reduce some of the negative impact from compact migration. Other alternative uses may also offer practical gains. For example, more translators could result in more effective health treatment. This adoption would address the need for preventive care among Micronesians and Marshallese in Hawaii. Department of the Interior believes compact sector grants are limited to use within the FAS. Interior agreed that some activities may be related both to sector grant priorities and to programs that would better prepare migrants to live and work in the United States. Interior does not intend to imply that funds should be shifted from providing assistance to FAS governments to assisting FAS citizens living in affected jurisdictions. We expect that compact sector grant awards will be provided consistent with the terms of the compacts and the amended compacts’ enabling legislation. shifted from the FAS governments to FAS migrants. The recommendation supports consideration of the use of sector grants in ways that respond to the concerns of FSM and Marshall Islands migrants and the affected jurisdictions. The U.S. Census emphasized that the migrant survey content was purposely chosen to enumerate compact migrants while minimizing costs and maximizing respondent participation. As our report notes, however, collecting only those data needed to enumerated migrants limited the collection of data that stakeholders such as affected jurisdictions would have found useful. report’s findings, the 2008 Guam and CNMI surveys were designed to produce estimates with a similar coefficient of variation to the ACS estimates for Hawaii. Census disagreed with our statement that the effect of using an earlier time frame of data in Hawaii relative to Guam and the CNMI results in an undercount of compact migrants in Hawaii. However, migration is ongoing, with approximately 7,000 persons estimated to have left the FSM and the Marshall Islands in 2007 and 2008. Other available data also indicate that the migrant population is growing. can lag behind the actual value for a growing small population at a given point in time. Census stated that the frequent changing of address by the compact migrant population, cited by Guam and CNMI officials as potentially leading to a miscount, would not produce bias in the surveys as designed. Researchers inside and outside the Census Bureau studying the foreign-born population agreed that an assumption of complete coverage of legal immigrants and temporary migrants in the 2000 Census was unreasonable indicating the potential for coverage error and bias of the estimates. participate in other surveys, indicating the potential for nonresponse bias. Census further stated that it gave both Guam and CNMI an opportunity to provide local information that might improve the accuracy but that neither produced this information before the design had to be finalized. We note that estimates across enumerations are not comparable due to changing methodology and the lack of use of a method that is not used in the enumeration. We also note that the estimates across jurisdictions, within an enumeration, is not comparable. statistically designed to measure change over time. We agree that the surveys have different bases for identification and have identified several reasons for these differences in appendix IV. We have also noted Arkansas’ concerns about the accuracy of the ACS data. We note that the Census Bureau did not determine the level of precision, or reliability, necessary for these estimates to be used for funding. While the ACS can be used to detect the presence of compact migrants, the smaller the population, the less reliable the estimates will be. documentation does not indicate that variance estimates properly accounted for the variability due to the nonresponse adjustment factor, such as through the use of replicate weight methodologies. The government of Hawaii stated that the report does not point out the inherent inadequacies of the American Community Survey. As our report notes, ACS data have limited statistical reliability for populations as small as compact migrants in Hawaii. We further note in appendix V that ACS estimates are not equivalent to point-in-time estimates and may be biased due to nonresponse and coverage error. discrepancies between the Census estimates in each affected jurisdiction and the utilization data for services provided by agencies in each jurisdiction. We did explore the use of school data in particular as a basis for evaluating the enumeration findings. However, we found that the schools identified compact migrant students by language (as in Hawaii) or ethnicity ( as in Guam and the CNMI) These definitions do not match that contained in the amended compacts' enabling legislation and could include the children of persons with FAS ethnicity who were present in Hawaii prior to the compacts. The government of Hawaii agrees that a portion of the sector grants given to the FAS might more effectively be used to provide services to compact citizens. The affected jurisdictions should provide input into the uses of the grants. The Federated States of Micronesia has used sector grant funds for activities in the affected jurisdiction of Guam. It seems compact migrants are treated as if they are citizens in that they have access to all federal and local resources. The FAS should highlight the nexus between sector grants and the issues that concern theFAS, compact migrants and affected jurisdictions. The Arkansas Department of Health expressed serious doubts about the count of Arkansas migrants based on American Community Survey data. The government of the FSM stated that our findings on compact migrant participation in local economies are not conclusive as to the net impact of migrants. The amended compacts' enabling legislation does not require the inclusion of such data in affected jurisdictions’ impact reports. We provided available information on labor market participation, taxes, consumption, and remittances. We believe that our recommendation that Interior prepare adequate cost guidance will help in determining compact impact costs. Local government agencies in affected jurisdictions do not use the definition of compact migrants in the amended compacts' enabling legislation. The Marshall Islands recommended that a methodology be developed that determines “net” compact costs. The government of the Marshall Islands noted that a number of Marshallese migrants attending public schools in the United States are U.S. citizens. The Census ACS tabulation we obtained for our estimates used Interior’s definition of a compact migrant. We provided available information on labor market participation, taxes, consumption, and remittances. and decision makers with comparative information on emigration, or migration rates from other Pacific Island nations. The government of the Marshall Islands stated that some of the data for enumerations for Marshallese in the state of Hawaii may be erroneous and overstated since some Marshallese only transit through Hawaii for a short period before moving to the U.S. mainland to accept employment. We do not have data to verify this assertion. We clarified our recommendation regarding compact sector grants to not imply that the use of sector grants should be in the affected jurisdictions. The amended compacts' enabling legislation does not require the inclusion of such data in affected jurisdictions’ impact reports. We provided available information on labor market participation, taxes, consumption, and remittances. The government of Palau stated that most agencies have included capital costs in their impact reporting, thus contributing to a gross overstatement of the costs associated with migrants. If Interior implements our recommendation to disseminate adequate guidance on compact impact reporting to affected jurisdictions, assessing impact by FAS country may be a topic for Interior to address. The government of Palau noted that ethnic Palauans in the United States may be U.S. citizens, permanent resident aliens (Green Card holders) or members of the Armed Forces and their dependents. Interior interprets the legislation’s definition of qualified nonimmigrant as including those migrants’ children under the age of 18 who are born in United States. However, we agree with Palau that some persons who entered the United states after the date of the compacts are included in the count of migrants. may be lawfully present in U.S. areas under authorities other than those of Section 141 of the compacts and have noted this in the report.

Summary:
Postsecondary institutions that serve large proportions of low-income and minority students are eligible to receive grants from Education. Funding for Title III and V programs has increased significantly over the past 10 years. An institution can use the grants to focus on one or more activities to address challenges articulated in its comprehensive development plan. The Higher Education Act outlines broad goals for these grants, but provides flexibility to institutions in deciding what approaches will best meet their needs, the report says. of the report: Funding for the programs included in our review has almost tripled from fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year 2009, increasing from $230 million to $681 million. GAO and Education’s Inspector General have recommended multiple times that Education implement a systematic monitoring approach. In 2009, we found that Education had made progress in automating its monitoring tools and developing risk-based criteria. Since our report was published, Education required all major program offices to develop a monitoring plan for fiscal year 2010. Education has not consistently developed realistic, attainable, measurable and measurable targets for each of the tools and activities outlined in the monitoring plan. For example, Education developed specific goals for the number of site visits and technical assistance it would conduct. Education did not hold conferences for 3 years from 2007 to 2009, despite strong grantee interest. Education held a conference for all Title III and V grantees in March 2010. Education officials told us that they plan to organize another conference in 2011. Education has also created an e-mail address for grantees to express concerns, ask questions, or make suggestions about the programs. The address is displayed on every Education grantee’s website. The report recommended that Education disseminate information to grantees about common implementation challenges. program Web page and is monitored by an Education official not associated with the program office to allow grantees to provide anonymous feedback. Education lacks assurance that grantees appropriately manage federal funds, increasing the potential for fraud, waste, or abuse. In our 2009 report, we reviewed financial and grant project records at seven institutions participating in Title III and V programs in fiscal year 2006 and identified $142,943 in questionable funding. The survey will be sent to new grantees and grantees that are near the end of their grant period. expenses at 4 of the 7 institutions we visited (see table 4). At one institution—Grantee D—we identified significant internal control weaknesses and $105,117 in questionable expenditures. Of the questionable expenditures we identified, $88,195 was attributed to an activity designed to promote character and leadership development. More than $79,975 was used for student trips to locations such as resorts and amusement parks. Officials at the institution ignored multiple warnings about mismanagement of this activity from external evaluators hired to review the grant. system and risk-based criteria—to assess potential risks. Education has taken some steps to respond to our most recent recommendations, but it is too early to tell if it has fully embraced a risk- based monitoring approach. Until Education is fully committed to such an approach, Title III and V funds will continue to be at risk for fraud, waste, or abuse. The internal control weaknesses and questionable expenditures we identified at some grantees we reviewed demonstrate the importance of having a strong and coordinated monitoring and assistance program in place. grantees with the greatest risk and needs is critical to ensuring that grant funds are appropriately spent. We will continue to track Education’s progress in fully implementing our recommendations. I would be happy to answer any questions that you or other members of the subcommittee may have.

Summary:
U.S. Coast Guard provides and operates icebreakers to meet military, logistic, and research needs. The Arctic region is a very harsh operating environment, making research expensive and risky. A 340-foot vessel was designed with significant icebreaking capability and the capacity to perform 90-day missions in the Arctic region. This vessel is expected to cost about $120 million and is scheduled to begin duty in 1998, Coast Guard officials say. But a 1990 study of national polar icebreaker requirements did not call for the construction of the proposed vessel. National Science Foundation analyzed options for buying and leasing Arctic research vessel. Analysis found that the federal government would have the least cost if it purchased the proposed vessel. Cost advantage of government purchase over long-term leasing of the vessel is related to two factors. After bids are solicited, NSF will need to decide whether to buy or lease the vessel. The range by which purchase was advantageous ranged from $22.9 million to $99.6 million, each in terms of present value. GAO: We reviewed many relevant studies, including those written by the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee, the Arctic Research Commission, the Polar Research Board, the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System, and NSF. We did not independently verify and validate the cost data that NSF used in the analyses. The observation that the United States does not possess a dedicated Arctic research vessel is insufficient justification for spending $120 million to construct the proposed vessel. We disagree with NSF’s view that we imply a reduced need for scientific research platforms. The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free. Additional copies are $2 each.

Summary:
NORAD has not done routine risk assessments as part of a risk-based management approach to determine ASA operational requirements. NORAD could better evaluate the extent to which previous threats have been mitigated by DOD or other government agencies. Routine risk assessments could also help NORAD determine the appropriate level and type of resources for ASA operations, especially in a resource-restricted environment. Air Force did not implement ASA operations as a steady-state mission because it has focused on other priorities, such as overseas military operations. Of the 18 ASA sites, 13 sites are currently equipped with F-16s, which, according to ANG estimates, will reach the end of their useful service lives between fiscal years 2015 and 2020. Five sites have F-15s which were grounded for 3 months in late 2007 and early 2008. Depending on when the F- 16s reach theend of their service lives and on the availability of next-generation F-22 and F-35 fighter aircraft, a gap in the number of available aircraft may affect units performing ASA operations. summary, we recommended that the Secretary of Defense direct The Commander of the U.S. command element of NORAD to routinely conduct risk assessments to determine ASA requirements. The Secretary of the Air Force to establish a timetable and implement ASA operations as a steady-state mission. DOD partially concurred with our recommendation to employ a risk-based management approach, which would include routine risk assessments. DOD stated that sufficient guidance and a long-standing risk- based process currently guide its decisions on ASA operations and, therefore, it does not plan on taking any further action. testimony, please contact Davi M.

Summary:
The 1967 President’s Commission on Budget Concepts recommended a dual system of accounting for federal receipts. Congress grants agencies authority to spend offsetting collections either through permanent or current appropriations. Offsetting receipts offset budget authority and outlays, but at a level other than at the expenditure account. The agencies we reviewed increased the overall amount of fees they collected and these fees constituted a larger proportion of their budgets in fiscal 1991 than in fiscal 1996 among the 27 agencies among the agencies we examined. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's migratory bird conservation activities are funded through appropriated offsetting receipts. appropriated to carry out provisions of the Central Valley Project Improvement Act. The Congress increased the reliance of the U.S. Mint and INS on user fees, though not to the extent of the agencies noted above. Most new user fees enacted in fiscal years 1991 and 1996 were funded by user fees. With four agencies, the percentage of their budgets funded through user fees remained stable between fiscal years1991 and 1996. In fiscal year 1996, the. U.s. Mint was restructured to operate with a single revolving fund. between fiscal years 1991 and 1996 were designated as offsets to discretionary spending for BEA purposes. In fiscal year 1991, 6 of the 27 agencies, the Postal Service, APHIS, SEC, NRC, INS and FCC, had 90 percent or more of their total spending classified as discretionary spending. By fiscal year 1996, four additional agencies, PTO, NTIS, FTC, and the Panama Canal Commission, had more than 90 percent of theirtotal spendingclassified as discretionary. Spending for two of these additional agencies went from 100 percent mandatory spending to 100 percent discretionary spending by 1996. The current trend to net fees against spending at the account or agency level offers agencies some stability, even potential growth. Fee-reliant agencies face management issues not faced by those that depend primarily on general fund appropriations. Agencies’ reliance on fees may raise expectations that these agencies will be self-supporting, the authors say. They ask: What rules make sense for comparable types of activities? What are the best ways of presenting user fees in a unified budget that will be inclusive and consistent? that is, offsetting that results from business-like activities, does not inhibit tradeoffs between programs or limit congressional flexibility in decision-making. This type of spending is self-controlling. A clear line between governmental and business-type activities is even less likely to be applied in the future given the overwhelming benefits of offsetting under BEA discretionary spending limits. We are sending copies of this report to other interested Members of the Congress and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. We will make copies available to others on Fees for business or regulatory services to the public provided a significant and continuing source of funding. Twenty-seven agencies met our criteria. We defined our universe of fee-reliant agencies using the following criteria: (1) fees from the public must be used to support the agency that generated the fee, (2) services, goods, or benefits must be provided in exchange for fees and the exchange should be closely linked in time, and (3) budget authority from fees must represent 20 percent or more of the budget. agency’s gross outlays from federal sources averaged over fiscal years 1991 through 1996. This excludes offsetting collections and associated outlaysfrom federal sources. Insurance and retirement programs were excluded because of the delay between when a fee is paid and when there is a pay out. Certain accounts of the agencies we identified as fee-reliant were excluded from subsequent analyses. The Funds for Strengthening Markets, Income, and Supply account was excluded because most of its funding is transferred to other programs, principally child nutrition. account were excluded from Federal Communication Commission totals. The 27 agencies span 7 of the 13 appropriations subcommittees. To review the classification and treatment of fees in budget accounts, we used OMB codes created for the President’s annual budget request. We also conducted interviews in six agencies: Agricultural Marketing Service, National Technical Information Service, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Patent and Trademark Office and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This work describes overall trends in 27 fee-financed agencies, but is not generalizable to all agencies with fees. Table III.1 shows the change in classification from fiscal year 1991 to fiscal year 1996 for accounts in the 27 agencies we reviewed. Four agencies showed decreases in spending classified as discretionary, while spending classifications for nine agencies in our survey did not change. Table includes only those agency accounts that have fees from the public. An agency may have additional accounts that only get general fund appropriations or were excluded as noted in appendix I. Revolving funds include public enterprise and trust revolving funds. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, as amended, divided spending at the budget account level into two broad categories: discretionary and mandatory. sequestration had occurred in fiscal year 1996, all of FCC’s budget authority in its Salaries and Expenses account would have been subject to sequestration. However, without the need for sequestration, only $59 million, or the net budget authority, is counted as discretionary spending. Current and permanent appropriations refer to the timing of legislative action in making budget authority available to an agency. When budget authority is enacted permanently, it is available until spent. Such authority can be the result of substantive legislation or appropriations acts. Spending authorized as permanent increased for 13 of the 27 agencies in our survey. Twelve other agencies did not see changes in the percent of the their funding classified as either permanent or current. GIPSA and APHIS had small declines in funding from what was permanently appropriated. NTIS received small appropriations in fiscal years 1993 and 1995. Under the broadest definition of the term, a department, agency, or instrumentality of the U.S. government is under the jurisdiction of authorizing committees. There are six types of federal budget accounts and all can receive user fees from the public. General Fund Accounts are composed of all federal funds not allocated to any other account. Special Fund Accounts: These accounts record receipts collected from a specific source and earmarked by law for a specific purpose. Nonrevolving trust fund accounts finance programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Superfund. The basic forms of budget authority include the following: Appropriations: An act of the Congress that permits federal agencies to incur obligations. Borrowing Authority: Statutory authority that permits a federal agency to make payments for specified purposes out of money borrowed from the Treasury. year in which it ends; for example fiscal year 1998 is the year beginning October 1, 1997, and ending September 30, 1998. The purpose of the IOAA, also called the “User Charge Statute,’ was to distribute the costs of government services to those who received benefits beyond those provided to the general public. The statute gave agencies for the first time broad statutory authority to set fees through administrative regulation. Any fees collected under this authority are deposited in the general fund of the Treasury and not credited to the agency. transfer of funds made to liquidate a federal obligation. Outlays also occur when interest on the Treasury debt held by the public accrues. Also, under credit reform, the credit subsidy cost is recorded as an outlay when a direct or guaranteed loan is disbursed. Under the Budget Enforcement Act, the principle that all direct spending and tax legislation enacted after BEA for a fiscal year must be deficit-neutral in the aggregate. If the Congress enacts direct spending or receipts legislation that is not deficit- neutral, it is not considered an expenditure. causes a net increase in the deficit, it must offset that increase by either increasing revenues or decreasing another direct spending program in the same fiscal year. This requirement is enforced by sequestration. Federal Electricity Activities: The Federal Government’s Net Cost and Potential for Future Losses, Volumes I and II.

Summary:
The gross tax gap is an estimate of the difference between the taxes that should have been paid voluntarily and on time and what was actually paid for a specific year. Underreporting of tax liabilities can occur when a taxpayer underreports income earned or overclaims deductions from income. IRS has concerns with the certainty of the tax gap estimate for tax year 2001 in part because some areas of the 2001 estimate rely on data originally gathered in the 1970s and 1980s. IRS seeks to improve voluntary compliance through efforts such as education and outreach programs. Estimating efficiency costs associated with the tax system is challenging because it has extensive and diverse effects on behavior. In a 2005 report, we found no comprehensive estimates of the efficiency costs of the current federal tax system. The two most comprehensive studies we found suggest that these costs are large—on the order of magnitude of 2 to 5 percent of GDP each year (as of the mid- 1990s) However, the actual efficiency costs may not fall within this range because of uncertainty surrounding taxpayers’ behavioral responses. In 2010, IRS processed about 137 million returns. About 90 percent of returns are prepared by individual taxpayers or paid preparers using professional or commercial software. IRS audits of returns prepared by a paid preparer showed a higher error rate. Some misreporting is due to complex tax laws, but some misreporting also is caused by human error, the authors say. The authors conclude that the use of tax software and paid tax return preparers may mitigate the need for taxpayers to understand complexities of the tax code. Taxpayers are required to report securities transactions on their federal income tax returns. Complex income-reporting requirements for securities transactions may contribute to taxpayers’ misreporting their income. IRS estimates 8.4 million of the estimated 21.9 million taxpayers with securities transactions misreported their gains or losses for tax year 2001. For securities sales, an estimated 64 percent of taxpayers underreported their income from securities (i.e., they understated gains or overstated losses) Small businesses are subject to multiple layers of filing, reporting, and deposit requirements. An S corporation is a federal business type that provides tax benefits and limited liability protection to shareholders. S corporations are not generally taxed at the entity level. Shareholders generally can only claim losses and deductions up to the amount of basis the shareholder has in the S corporation’s stock and debt. IRS officials and S corporation stakeholder representatives told us that calculating and tracking basis was one of the biggest challenges in complying with S corporation rules. The growing number of tax expenditures is among the causes of tax code complexity. Tax expenditures add to tax code complexity in part because they require taxpayers to learn about, determine their eligibility for, and choose between tax expenditures that have similar purposes. Tax expenditures also complicate tax planning, as taxpayers must predict their own future circumstances as well as future tax rules to make the best choice among provisions. While the tax code includes numerous types of savings incentives, my statement will focus on retirement savings as a key example. Taxpayers can choose between traditional Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRA) and Roth IRAs for retirement savings. distributions diverge for traditional and Roth IRAs. Taxpayers may not know that a 10 percent early withdrawal penalty, with some exceptions, applies to both IRA types. Frequent changes to IRA rules have also made tax planning more difficult for taxpayers. IRS research and enforcement data show that many taxpayers misreported millions of dollars in traditional IRA contributions and distributions on their tax returns, the agency said in a 2008 report. The underreported net income due to misreported IRA distributions was $6.3 billion, it said. In 2005, 28 percent, or nearly 601,000 tax filers, did not maximize their potential tax benefit. Some tax expenditures also provide taxpayers who intend to evade taxes with opportunities to do so. The First-time Homebuyer Credit (FTHBC) has confused taxpayers and allowed individuals to make fraudulent claims for the refundable credit. No single approach is likely to fully and cost-effectively address noncompliance since the noncompliance has been so high, the authors say. The total amount to be repaid by taxpayers is $7 billion.  Enhancing information reporting can reduce complexity for taxpayers. It can also reduce the opportunities available for taxpayers to evade taxes. New requirements on third parties to submit information returns would require statutory changes. improvements to existing information-reporting forms may be done administratively by IRS. The extent to which individual taxpayers accurately report the income they earn has been shown to be related to the extent to Which income is reported to them and IRS by third parties or taxes on the income are withheld. For example, employers report most wages, salaries, and tip compensation to employees and IRS. Findings from IRS’s study of individual tax compliance indicate that nearly 99 percent of these types of income are accurately reported on individual tax returns. One area where improved information reporting could help is higher- education expenses. IRS enforcement officials cited limited information reporting as a major challenge in ensuring compliance. Ensuring high-quality services is a necessary foundation for voluntary compliance, so action by IRS to improve information reporting should be taken, authors say. The authors recommend IRS revise Form 1098-T to improve the usefulness of information. improve the quality of services provided to taxpayers would be beneficial. High-quality services can help taxpayers who wish to comply but do not understand their obligations. For example, if tax forms and instructions are unclear, taxpayers may be confused and make unintentional errors. Ensuring high-quality taxpayer services would also be a key consideration in implementing any of the approaches for tax gap reduction.. Changing tax laws and regulations would also require educating taxpayers about the new requirements in a clear, timely, and accessible manner. Despite heavy call volume, the accuracy of IRS responses to taxpayers’ questions remained above 90 percent. One way to simplify the tax code is to eliminate or combine tax expenditures. The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA) could lead to more efficient and economical executive-branch service delivery in overlapping program areas. The act is intended to identify the various agencies and federal activities—including spending programs, regulations, and taxes - that could help inform reexamination or restructuring efforts. Tax reform would most likely result in a smaller tax gap if the new system has few tax preferences or complex tax code provisions. Adding complexity through exemptions or reduced rates for some goods or services generally decreases revenue and increases compliance risks. Such complexity also increases the record-keeping burden on businesses and increases the government resources devoted to enforcement. Devoting additional resources to enforcement could lead to a larger tax gap than if no changes are made to the tax system at the start of the reform process. The government may attempt to mitigate large gains and losses by implementing transition rules. The amount that the tax gap could be reduced depends in part on factors such as the size of budget increases, how IRS manages any additional resources. Providing IRS with additional funding would enable it to contact millions of potentially noncompliant taxpayers it currently identifies but cannot contact given resource constraints. However, devoting additional resources to enforcement will not completely close theTax gap. For example, in a 2009 report, the Treasury Department estimated that the U.S. owes $1.2 trillion in back taxes. IRS could reduce the tax gap by expanding compliance checks before issuing refunds to taxpayers. IRS currently matches data provided on over 2 billion information returns to tax returns only after the normal filing season. Matching during the filing season would allow IRS to detect and correct errors before it sends taxpayers their refunds. Congress would play a key role if Congress changed the law to include more prerefund compliance checks for tax payers.. We reported that IRS’s compliance programs focused on sole proprietors’ underreporting of income addressed only a small portion of sole proprietor expense noncompliance. Higher-education tax preferences provide an example of inconsistent definitions for qualified education expenses. What tax filers are allowed to claim as a qualified higher-education expense varies between some of the various savings and credit provisions in the tax code. There are no easy solutions to the tax gap, but addressing it is as important as ever before in the face of rising taxes. The American Opportunity Credit and the Lifetime Learning Credit are examples of tax preferences that are inconsistent and need to be addressed in the same way. of the nation’s fiscal challenges. Innovative thinking and the combined efforts of IRS and Congress will be needed now and in the years to come. Chairman Baucus, Ranking Member Hatch, and Members of the Committee, this completes my prepared statement. I would be happy to respond to any questions you may have at this time.

Summary:
Electronic commerce is still a small part of the U.S. economy. Retail electronic commerce dollar volume has increased in all but two of the last six quarters. Business-to-consumer Internet sales were estimated to increase to between $78 billion and $143 billion in 2003. GartnerGroup: Through 2006 the pace of innovation will increase as enterprises institutionalize electronic business, and small businesses “must embrace this transition or risk their long-term viability and survival.” The federal government is taking steps to increase its use of electronic commerce. On-line procurement is a multivendor Internet-based purchasing site, sometimes called an “electronic mall.” An example of an electronic mall is GSA Advantage!, in which government buyers can search listings, compare prices, and purchase items on-line. The federal government also supports electronic commerce by sponsoring programs that provide electronic commerce education to businesses. The government has taken, or plans to take, actions that are expected to address some of the government-specific obstacles to electronic commerce. Small businesses received a higher share of awards in the three on-line programs. Small businesses generally obtain a greater percentage of contract awards of $25,000 or less. Most of the contract awards made through DMLSS E-CAT and GSA Advantage! were small, which may at least partially account for the relatively large share of dollars awarded to small businesses in these programs. In fiscal year 2000, 91 percent of D MLSS E.CAT awards and 93 percent of GSA. Advantage! awards were $25k or less, compared to only 3% of ITSS awards. on-line procurement programs than the governmentwide share. Some small businesses still face reported obstacles to successfully participating in on-line government purchasing activities. Obstacles reported generally fall into two categories: general readiness and those specific to conducting procurements electronically with the federal government. While these obstacles were reported in the context of small businesses, some—such as security and privacy—also apply to all businesses. Still, it is essential that it consider the obstacles that some small businesses face and work to implement solutions that address these obstacles. GSA’s Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) Web site is the single governmentwide point of electronic entry on the Internet. Each of the four federally funded business assistance programs in our review provided electronic commerce education as part of its operations. Three of these programs are oriented toward management issues and addressed electronic commerce as only one part of their responsibilities. The fourth program, ECRC, focused entirely on electronic commerce. The ECRC program was terminated September 30, 2001. training as well as counseling or technical assistance to individual clients. Subjects covered by the three management-oriented programs’ local offices in their electronic commerce assistance activities are shown in table 6. According to local and regional office officials, offices tailor the types of topics offered to meet local and individual client needs. In fiscal year 2000, ECRCs reported providing 3,468 training courses with a total enrollment of 53,800 students of whom 37,968 were DOD staff and 15,832 were non-DOD staff. The ECRC program was discontinued on September 30, 2001. Reaction to this decision at the local offices of the management-oriented programs was mixed. Six were concerned about losing access to expertise or about not having the staff or resources to address issues handled by the ECRCs. Four did not have such concerns. Most of the remaining eight offices did not discontinue the program. The ECRC is no longer available to clients of the SBA Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award. The award is given to the person who wins the most entrepreneurial awards in the U.S. The four business assistance programs generally coordinated their efforts. At the headquarters level, there is no ongoing process for coordinating electronic commerce activities. Neither DLA’s Electronic Business Program Office nor its PTAC program plans to keep the course materials up to date. According to DLA officials, materials for the ECRC training courses will be turned over to itsPTAC program, which plans to make them available to local PTACs via downloads from a DLA Web site. Not universal in that we found instances in which such coordination was not occurring. programs. Small businesses successfully obtained a relatively large share of federal procurement dollars in three specific on-line procurement programs. The government has taken, or plans to take, actions that are expected to address some of these obstacles. Key to the success of small businesses’ participation in government electronic procurements is that both parties—the government and the businesses themselves—continue to work on overcoming these and any future obstacles that may arise. We are also sending copies of this report to the Chairman, Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. To determine the small business share of procurement dollars awarded by three on-line procurement programs, we obtained fiscal year 1999 and 2000 award data for these programs. To identify what, if any, obstacles exist for small businesses in conducting electronic procurements with the federal government, we performed a literature search. We also interviewed selected SBDCs, PTACs, ECRCs, and MEPs about their clients’ experiences with obstacles. We obtained comments from organizations representing or working with small businesses to obtain their views on obstacles. For each program, we judgmentally selected six offices from each program based on the following: chose at least one office from each of the four U.S. census regions. Overall, we chose at least two local offices from each census Division. The census divides the United States into four regions and nine divisions. Based on the above criteria, we interviewed officials from the following offices: ECRCs Bremerton, WA Cleveland, OH Dallas, TX Fairfax, VA Scranton, PA MEPs Arkansas Manufacturing Extension Network California Manufacturing Technology Center Idaho Techhelp Iowa MEP Maine MEP Maryland Technology Center PTACs Alabama Small Business Development Consortium California We conducted our review between January and August 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Obstacles reported by various studies and surveys as well as from comments provided by officials in selected federal business assistance programs and organizations representing or working with small businesses. We performed our work at SBA headquarters in Washington, DC, GSA offices in Crystal City, VA, and Washington, D.C.; DLA headquarters at Fort Belvoir in VA; Defense Supply Center, Philadelphia; NIST in Gaithersburg, MD. Small businesses may have difficulty in making a business case for adopting electronic commerce. They may have little working knowledge of the Internet and other electronic commerce technologies. Small businesses, particularly in rural areas and on Indian reservations, have difficulty obtaining affordable high-speed Internet access. Ensuring the security of payments and proprietary information and privacy of personal data are a top priority for small businesses considering electronic commerce as a means to sell their products and services. The continuing expansion of electronic commerce requires widespread high- speed, high-capacity connection to the Internet. Small businesses may not be prepared to take on the kinds of security and privacy risks that larger companies can more easily face. Small businesses fear bidding on-line because they do not believe that it is secure. Information security has been designated a governmentwide high-risk area since 1997. Commonly cited obstacles in this category include the following. Monitoring Various Federal Procurement Information Web Sites for Business Opportunities. The federal government has multiple Web sites that list business opportunities for small businesses. They want assurances that their pricing and other proprietary information would be accessed only by intended recipients and not by competitors. Small businesses cannot afford to spend several hours a day “surfing the Net” for potential work. Federal Acquisition Regulation change designates FedBizOpps Web site as single governmentwide point of electronic entry on the Internet. After subscribing, vendors can receive various announcements automatically via email, including solicitations and post-award notices. Information about contracting opportunities expected to be $25,000 or less does not have to be posted on FedBzOpps, officials say. electronic catalogs to multiple sites, involving different formats and procedures. As of mid-August, GSA Advantage!, DMLSS E-CAT, and others were in the initial stages of considering implementing a single catalog process for medical materiel. Vendors who want to conduct business with more than one government office generally must complete multiple registrations and profiles, providing redundant business information to vendors. Some commodity suppliers may perceive an on-line catalog to be impractical, due to the sheer number of their products and the complexity of their pricing. DOD developed a centralized, electronic registration process for vendors that want to conduct business with DOD. SBA’s Procurement Marketing and Access Network (PRO-Net) is an Internet-based database of information on thousands of small businesses. Even if a single governmentwide registration system is implemented, small businesses may still wish to register on PRO-Net. A governmentwide single point of vendor registration should help to standardize the registration process, eliminate redundancies, and provide a common method of gathering and reporting vendor information. Small businesses find it difficult to find, download, and print on-line specifications and drawings. Problems include incomplete and inadequate technical data packages for manufactured items. Small businesses often have difficulty reaching someone at the buyer’s or program office who is able and willing to help. Government has pursued many different electronic commerce solutions and has not adopted a uniform “single face” approach to the vendor community, ECRC officials say. The National Electronic Commerce Coordinating Council suggests organizations implement a customer relations management structure.

Summary:
GPRA is intended to shift the focus of government decisionmaking, management, and accountability from activities and processes to the results and outcomes achieved by federal programs. Under GPRA, annual performance plans are to clearly inform the Congress and the public of the annual performance goals for agencies’ major programs and activities. These annual plans, issued soon after the transmittal of the president’s budget, provide a direct linkage between an agency's longer-term goals and mission and day-to-day activities. Annual performance reports are to report on the degree to which performance goals were met. Justice fell short of achieving its performance targets for four measures. Overall progress made by Justice toward achieving less drug- and gang- related violence is difficult to ascertain. Three of nine performance measures did not have fiscal year 2000 targets to measure success. Justice’s responsibilities are divided among a number of major components, including the DEA, FBI, INS, the Office of Justice Programs (OJP), and the United States Marshals Service (USMS), as well as the Department of Justice. Justice did not set performance targets for these measures because it considered two of the measures to be new measures. Justice did not want to set performance levels because it believes that setting performance targets could cause the public to perceive law enforcement as engaging in “bounty hunting” or pursuing arbitrary targets merely for the sake of meeting particular goals. Justice fell short of achieving the performance targets. for four measures. For example, although close, Justice didn't meet its performance target to dismantle Asian criminal enterprises. perform 4.81 million criminal background checks. Justice did not meet its performance target to prevent 140,244 persons with criminal backgrounds from purchasing firearms. Justice reported that only 27 states have become full participants in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. In an April 2000 report, we reported that the states generally are better positioned than the FBI to conduct background checks and that there are potential barriers to states participating in NICS.. Justice’s performance report does not articulate the implications of potential barriers. Justice reported that in fiscal year 2000, it had initiated 19,549 new Interpol cases and entered into 8 treaties. Justice noted that it had not met its performance targets for these measures because there are a number of outside entities that have key roles in these efforts. Justice did not discuss any actions that it might take to mitigate the effects of external factors. If the intent is for all states to participate, agencies should show how strategies will be implemented, the report said. The report suggested that to improve the usefulness of annual plans, agencies show how Strategies will be deployed. used to achieve goals that include describing approaches to leverage or mitigate the effects of external factors on the accomplishment of performance goals. Justice’s strategies and initiatives to achieve less drug- and gang-related violence generally seem reasonable and clear. Justice could improve its performance strategies by exploring potential coordination efforts that might be used to mitigate external factors and by considering the use of performance evaluations to better assess its progress toward achieving the outcome, the authors say. They suggest that Justice could compare the relative effectiveness of programs using a program evaluation approach to provide an indication of its progress. Justice fell short of achieving the performance targets for three measures. Justice did not include specific strategies or goals for mitigating the implications of FBI and OCDETF resource constraints. Justice’s strategies and initiatives to reduce the availability and/or use of drugs generally seem reasonable and clear. Justice reported that it has developed a number of programs through which investigators can coordinate. However, the plan does not include strategies for enhancing or measuring the contribution of these programs to the overall achievement of the outcome of the drug war. fully gauge because the measures did not enable us to assess progress toward achieving this planned outcome. Justice did not explicitly discuss the reason for missing the performance target for average case processing time, but implied that it was a resource issue. Justice’s performance report indicated data limitations and efforts to improve the accuracy and timeliness of the data. In a May 2001 report, we said that aliens face long waits for a resolution to their case and have difficulty obtaining accurate information on how long they can expect to wait. We recommended that INS develop the capability to begin to calculate and report actual processing times. strategies and initiatives do not sufficiently discuss achieving the outcome to provide timely, consistent, fair, and high-quality services. INS has quality standards that it is using as a measure, but the performance plan does not articulate the specific quality standards. Justice did not discuss the implications of using strategic human capital management as a strategy to help achieve this outcome even though one performance target was not achieved until resources were realigned. Thus, the deployment of available staff appears to be critical to achieving the timeliness performance targets. Justice identified that it is deploying CLAIMS 4 software to field offices in fiscal year 2001. The performance report does not explain how the information technology improvements will contribute to achieving better INS services. Overall progress made by INS towards achieving this outcome is difficult to fully gauge because INS has a new performance measure for which there was no fiscal year 2000 performance target, and the other two performance measures did not enable us to assess progress. In our February 1999 report, we note that the listing of current programs and initiatives that were often included in agencies’ plans were useful. Justice did not set a performance target for high-priority border corridors demonstrating optimum deterrence. Justice’s strategy to secure U.S. borders from illegal immigration does not adequately discuss integration of resources to achieve the outcome. Justice exceeded, by a significant number, its performance targets for intercepting undocumented offshore travelers en route to the United States. The agency does not believe that overseas efforts have produced long-term impacts because training that INS personnel provided to foreign air carrier and law enforcement personnel diminished within a few months. Justice's fiscal year 2000 report and fiscal year 2002 plan address concerns, recommendations. Justice’s performance report included historical data to provide perspective on its progress. Justice identified personnel skills that supported each strategic goal, but did not discuss whether it needed to acquire or develop staff to meet agency needs. Justice did not address human capital strategies in relation to achieving programmatic outcomes for drug trafficking organizations and providing timely processing of naturalization applications. The plan does not explain how the strategies are mutually reinforcing, nor does it explain common or complementary performance indicators. can explore the benefits of a program as well as ways to improve program performance by examining a broader range of information. For example, a program evaluation was conducted of an INS border control initiative in El Paso, Texas. Operation Hold the Line was a new INS enforcement approach introduced in 1993. The evaluation collected data to assess the effects on illegal and legal crossings, business activity, crime, education, births, and the use of social services. It also looked at the effects of Operation Hold The Line on a number of outcomes. The fiscal year 2002 performance plan clearly identified the OIG management challenges and Justice designated areas of material weaknesses. The plan does not consistently identify our recommendations or concerns in relation to achieving goals and performance measures. The agency outcomes that were used as the basis for our review were identified by the Ranking Minority Member of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs as important mission areas for the agency. The major management challenges confronting Justice, including the governmentwide high-risk areas of strategic human capital management and information security, were identified in our January 2001 performance and accountability series. Justice: Report focuses heavily on what its performance report and plan do not discuss. Justice believes that our report does not focus on improvements the agency has made. Justice acknowledged that the outcomes we used in our analysis were prescribed. But other than the example Justice cited in its comments, the historical data for the other measures did not clearly demonstrate improvements. We addressed many of the improvements that Justice made under the section comparing the performance report, plan with the previous year’s report, and plan. We revised the text to include the historicalData regarding reported improvement to reduce the processing time of naturalization cases. Justice believes that the outcome of reduced availability and/or use of illegal drugs is not part of its mission. If drug trafficking organizations are disrupted and dismantled, clearly this will affect the availability of drugs on the street. Justice believes that its performance measures have matured over time and indicated that it has discontinued old and old and outdated goals and measures. In our opinion, reducing drug- and gang-related violence is part of Justice’s mission, but only four of its measures should have been used in our analysis. added new measures as appropriate. Since some measures are new in fiscal year 2002, performance targets did not exist for the fiscal year 2000 plan. Nevertheless, Justice reported on its accomplishments by providing historical data for fiscal years 1999 and 2000 whenever possible. Justice believes that this is particularly significant for two outcomes: (1) timely, consistent, fair, and high-quality services provided by INS and (2) U.S. borders secure from illegal immigration. It believes that it is unfair for us to report that its performance was not considered sufficient to assess progress merely because there was no performance target to measure. believes that it is particularly discouraging for the managers and analysts that worked to develop a measure which Justice believes is an excellent example of reporting outcomes. Justice believes that the format used in appendix I of our report did not lend itself to an accurate description of its performance report and plan. In the column describing how Justice assessed its progress in resolving the management challenges, we sometimes indicated that progress relative to a management challenge was not discussed. Justice suggested that, where appropriate, we should indicate in the report column that information about a particular challenge is included under the “plan” column. Department of Justice's fiscal year 2002 performance plan includes goals and measures to address the challenges that we and the OIG identified. Justice officials pointed out that progress for these management challenges are not discussed in the fiscal year 2000 performance report because there were no goals, measures, or strategies in the plan. Of the agency’s 19 major management challenges identified by us and Justice's OIG, Justice's performance plan (1) had goals and Measures that were directly related to ten challenges; (2) had a goal but no measures that were indirectly applicable to two of the challenges. goals and measures related to two of the challenges, but discussed strategies to address them; or (5) had no goals, measures, or strategies toaddress four of the challenge. or (6) discussed strategies, but did not have goals or measures to address two or more of the Challenges. The challenges were to improve the quality of life for people living in the U.S. and to reduce the number of people who live in poverty.

Summary:
DOD depends overwhelmingly on the U.S. commercial electrical power grid for electricity to support its operations and missions. Concerns have been raised about the increasing vulnerability of the grid to more frequent or longer electrical power disturbances. Factors that contribute to the grid’s vulnerability include an aging electrical power infrastructure and increased reliance on automated control systems. The National Science and Technology Council has established a task force to identify research and development needs for electric grid vulnerabilities and to coordinate with other federal agencies to address those needs. Vulnerabilities may involve co-location of both primary and secondary electrical power equipment, single points of failure in an electrical power network, lack of security access controls, and insufficient backup sources of electrical power generation. To address such vulnerabilities, owners or operators of DOD assets may consider diversifying the locations of primary and secondaries. DOD identifies the vulnerabilities and manages the risks of its most critical assets to electrical power disruptions primarily through DCIP. DOD has established several complementary programs that help protect critical assets, including those listed in table 1. DOD’s most critical assets and the missions they support are vulnerable to disruptions in electrical power supplies. The U.S. commercial electrical power grids have become increasingly fragile and vulnerable to prolonged outages. DOD is identifying key vulnerabilities through DCIP vulnerability assessments, but as of June 2009, the department had conducted such assessments on only 14 of its 34 most critical Assets. DOD Instruction 3020.45 requires DOD to conduct vulnerability assessments on all of its most critical. assets at least once every 3 years. supply of electricity to its critical assets. DOD has also partnered with various federal agencies and industry organizations to further increase the assurance of electrical power. DOD serves as co-chair of the federal Task Force on Electric Grid Vulnerability of the National Science and Technology Council’s Committee on Homeland and National Security. The survey results confirm that some steps are being taken at various levels within DOD to improve the assuranceof electrical power supplies to its most critical assets, the authors say. But they say DOD has not yet established a mechanism for systematically tracking the implementation of future DCIP risk management decisions. DCIP guidance recognizes the importance of collaboration between DOD facilities with critical assets and their respective public utilities. DOD relies on commercial electrical power grids for secure, uninterrupted electrical power supplies to support its most critical assets. The Defense Science Board Task Force on DOD Energy Strategy says commercial power grids have become increasingly fragile and vulnerable to extended power disruptions. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is requesting funds for a pilot program that would involve extensive collaboration with the local electricity providers at selected U.s. Army installations. on DOD-owned most critical assets. DOD concurred with our recommendation that the department establish a time frame for the military services to provide the infrastructure data. DOD acknowledged that such information is necessary for the proper characterization of its critical assets from a public works perspective. We believe that the establishment of specific time frames for theMilitary is a good first step to getting the data required to complete the analysis on infrastructure located within the installations. We modified this recommendation to indicate that these data are required for completing—rather than conducting—the preliminary technical analysis. services to provide this important information is necessary because, as of July 2009, only one of the military services had begun to gather the requested information. DOD concurred with our recommendation that the department develop explicit DCIP guidelines for assessing the most critical assets’ risks and vulnerabilities to long-term electrical power disruptions. According to DOD, the ASD(HD&ASA)/DCIP Office will review current vulnerability assessment criteria and standards. We encourage DOD to finalize this draft manual and ensure that it provides explicit guidance on tracking the implementation of DCIP risk management decisions. local electricity providers in an effort to coordinate and help remediate or mitigate risks and vulnerabilities to electrical power disruptions. DOD’s comments cited existing guidance that, among other things, encourages government and private-sector decision makers to work with electricity providers. According to DOD, this guidance will be reinforced at DCIP forums for collaboration, such as meetings of the Defense Critical Infrastructure Integration Staff, Operational Advisory Board, and Defense Infrastructure Sector Council. We encourage DOD to reinforce such guidance concerning collaboration with local electricity providers directly with asset owners. GAO is sending copies of this report to other interested congressional parties. The report also is available at no charge on GAO’s Web site at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions concerning this report, please contact me at (202) 512-5431 or dagostinod@gao,gov. GAO: Use of disparate sets of guidance resulted in the selection and submission of assets to the Tier 1 Task Critical Asset list based on inconsistent criteria. To become more familiar with efforts currently taking place to assure the nation’s electrical power grid, we met with various officials from federal agencies, electrical power industry associations, and private-sector entities. We obtained relevant documentation and interviewed officials from the following organizations: Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Electricity Delivery & Energy Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Office of Electric Reliability. CACI International, Inc. Edison Electric Institute Pareto Energy, Inc., Talisman International, LLC. Regulatory Commission on the full draft report, which at the time was classified as SECRET because of DOD’s concerns about the classification and dissemination of the report. We did seek technical comments from these entities on sections of the initial draft report that pertained to their roles and responsibilities, which we incorporated in the report where appropriate. We conducted our surveys from May 2009 through August 2009, using self- administered electronic surveys. We sent a questionnaire on DOD critical assets to the owners and operators of DOD-owned critical assets. return electronically via SIPRNet after marking check boxes or entering responses up to the SECRET classification level into open answer boxes. Because this was not a sample survey, but rather a survey of the universe of respondents, it has no sampling errors. We sent the original three electronic questionnaires in May and June 2009. All questionnaires were returned by August 2009. In the end, we achieved a 100 percent response rate. However, the practical difficulties with the survey were difficult to overcome. GAO conducted this performance audit from October 2008 through October 2009. We conducted six follow-up site visits to a nonprobability sample of surveyed assets. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. The findings from our site visits are not generalizable to all 34 most critical assets, but we obtained follow- up survey information from installation personnel for critical assets and visited those assets to validate the survey responses, as applicable. We clarified responders’ interpretation of the survey questions, discussed their responses in detail. Both the primary and backup power supply systems exist in the same room for convenience of maintenance. Single transformer provides both commercial and Backup power to a critical asset. Bury electric power lines or protect poles with anti-ram barriers. Power lines share right-of-way with other key utilities. Generators and uninterruptible power supplies are not large enough to support the critical asset in case of primary power loss or in case the location does not stockpile sufficient fuel during an electrical power loss. minimum operational requirements for consumables (i.e., fuel) Distribute critical asset operations to other backup power supplied locations.

Summary:
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited discrimination in schools, employment, and places of public accommodation. The Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights has some responsibility for enforcing the Act. Title IV of the Act also authorizes Justice to file suit in federal court to enforce the civil rights of students in public education. The Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974 prohibits states from denying equal educational opportunity to individuals, including deliberate segregation of students on the basis of race, color, or national origin. In school year 2011-12, for the first time in about a decade, Education collected these data from all K-12 public schools in the United States. It makes its Civil Rights Data available to the public so that researchers, states, and districts can conduct their own analyses. Through its Magnet Schools Assistance Program, Education provides grants to local educational agencies to establish and operate magnet schools. These grants are intended to assist in the desegregation of public schools by supporting the elimination, reduction, and prevention of minority group isolation in elementary and secondary schools. Justice monitors and enforces the implementation of any open school desegregation court order to which Justice is a party. Education launched a 50-state strategy to enforce a statutory provision that required states to take steps to ensure poor and minority students are not taught by inexperienced, unqualified, or out-of- field teachers. Some of the cases that originally ordered districts to desegregate their schools back in the 1960s and 1970s are still open today. The onus is on the school district, not Justice, to seek unitary status. U.S. Supreme Court struck down several school districts’ student assignment plans that relied on racial classification. In 1975, approximately a decade after enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Black students were the largest minority group in public schools. In 2007, in Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, the Court held that the districts failed to show that the use of race in their student assignment plan was necessary to achieve their goal of racial diversity. The composition of the student population has changed significantly over time. In school year 2013-14, Hispanic students were the largest minority group in schools. Both groups continue to have poverty rates two to three times higher than the rates of White students. According to several studies, there is concern about this segment of the population that falls at the intersection of poverty and minority status in schools and how this affects their access to quality education. Of the approximately 93,400 K-12 public schools in the United States, 90 percent of them were traditional schools, 7 percent were charter schools. An extensive body of research over the past 10 years shows a clear link between schools’ socioeconomic (or income) composition and student academic outcomes. The studies, however, paint a more nuanced picture of the effects of schools' racial composition on student Academic outcomes. Over time, there has been a large increase in schools that are the most isolated by poverty and race. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that by 2044, minorities will be the largest minority group in K-12 public schools. Black or Hispanic, across most areas analyzed. In addition, comparing just the H/PBH traditional, charter, and magnet schools, we also found differences. These analyses, taken alone, should not be used to make conclusions about the presence or absence of unlawful discrimination. The Importance of Middle School Algebra, STEM courses, and AP and GATE Programs are especially beneficial in preparing students for college and successful careers. Among these are middle school algebra; courses in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields; Advanced Placement (AP) courses; and Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) programs. violated the state constitution, requiring the state to take action to diversify the urban district and its surrounding suburban schools. In response, the state and district took a variety of actions. In particular the state provided funding to build several new or completely renovated state-of-the-art magnet schools within the region to attract suburban students. To attract students from the city and suburbs, the magnet schools used highly specialized curriculum. For example, one newly renovated environmental sciences magnet school offered theme-based instruction. The state required the district’s magnet schools to maintain a student enrollment of no more than 75 percent minority students. Officials said maintaining a certain ratio of non- minority students posed challenges. The state also enabled students from the urban district to enroll in traditional schools (non-magnet) in the suburbs. Some families chose not to enroll their children in the suburban schools and instead opted to stay in close-by neighborhood schools, officials said. They also said the neighborhood schools were not required to maintaining a specified percentage of minority students like the magnets. The district in the South had previously been under a federal desegregation order. Students in the district represented about 120 different nationalities and languages. Under the new plan, parents were allowed to choose among schools within their attendance zones. The plan also supported students who chose to attend schools outside of these zones by providing public transit passes, while school bus transportation was provided to students who attended schools within the attendance zones, the authors say. But even after implementing the new diversity plan, officials told us that some families in their district sent their children to private schools, rather than attend the district's public schools. The district we visited in the West is located in a state with an “open-enrollment” law. White students often choose not to attend certain schools in the district. District officials told us that this left a largely Hispanic and low-income student population in those schools. Education has taken a range of actions to address racial discrimination in schools, the authors say.. English Learners, or foster care youth. The state provided additional funds for high-needs students, such as those eligible for free or reduced- price lunch. Education’s Office for Civil Rights launched 32 compliance reviews in fiscal years 2013 and 2014 across a range of issues related to racial discrimination. Education may withhold federal funds if a recipient is in violation of the civil rights laws and Education is unable to reach agreement with the parties. Education has also conducted more narrowly-focused investigations in response to complaints of discrimination, which can be filed by anyone who believes an educational institution that receives federal funds has discriminated against someone on the basis of race, color, or national origin. Education, it received about 2,400 such complaints in fiscal year 2014. Education found that the football coach directed racial slurs at Black players, and players who complained were harassed by their fellow students and staff. Education negotiated a resolution agreement with the district that required the district to review and revise its harassment and discrimination policies and take appropriate steps to remedy the harassment by the coach. The district also appointed a new coach and offered counseling to the players. The coach did not assist Black players with obtaining athletic scholarships, even stating that athletic scholarships are for White players. Education has issued guidance to schools on their obligations under the federal civil rights laws. Education could further enhance its current efforts by also more routinely analyzing data by school types and groupings, authors say. For example, through its analysis of its Civil Rights Data, Education identified an issue nationwide with disproportionately high suspension and expulsion rates of certain groups of students by race, among other characteristics. The disparities were most acute among H/PBH schools, with disparities most evident among traditional charter and magnet schools. The Department of Justice’s Educational Opportunities Section of the Civil Rights Division has taken several actions to address racial discrimination against students. Justice conducts investigations in response to complaints or reports of possible violations. By analyzing its data by groupings and types of schools, Education has an opportunity to enhance its efforts and better inform guidance and technical assistance to the groups and type of schools that need it most. Depending on the outcome of its investigation and the circumstances of the case, Justice could provide guidance and assistance. Justice monitors and enforces open federal school desegregation cases where Justice is a party. As of November 2015 there were 178 of these cases. Justice has issued guidance jointly with Education to ensure states and school districts understand their responsibilities to prevent and address racial discrimination in schools. For example, in 2000 Justice intervened in a civil rights lawsuit against a district, alleging the district failed to appropriately address harassment of a pair of students by other students. The parties negotiated an agreement, which was adopted by the court as an order, that required the district to maintain written records of each harassment allegation. it does not systematically track important summary information on these orders. As a consequence, the potential exists that some cases could unintentionally languish for long periods of time. For example, in a long-standing desegregation case, the court described a long period of dormancy in the case and stated that lack of activity had taken its toll. The court noted that had Justice “been keeping an eye” on relevant information, such as disparities in test scores, it could have brought it to the court’s attention. attention more quickly, allowing the court and district to address the issue in a timely fashion. Officials were unable to provide more detailed summary information across all of the open cases. Justice officials said that to obtain such information they would have to review each individual case file, some of which are voluminous and not stored electronically. The last action taken on the open orders within broad time frames of 5 years, 10 years, or 15 years was not available. The case name, the court docket number, the identification number generated by Justice, and the jurisdiction where the case originated are included in the system. According to Justice’s Strategic Plan, the agency has a goal to protect the rights of the American people and enforce federal law. According to this Plan, Justice seeks to address and prevent discrimination and segregation in elementary and secondary schools. The Plan states that the extent to which societal attitudes and practices reflect a continuing commitment to tolerance, diversity, and equality affect the scope and nature of Justice's work. Federal internal control standards state that routine monitoring should be a part of normal operations to allow an agency to assess how the entity being monitored is performing over time. monitoring of activities. Without a systematic way to track key information about all of the open desegregation cases, Justice may lack the summary information needed to monitor the status of its orders. This may affect the agency’s ability to effectively manage its caseload and to promote and protect civil rights. More than 60 years after the Brown decision, our work shows that disparities in the justice system are still wide and deep. We need to do more to close the gap between the rich and the poor. Black and Hispanic students are increasingly attending high-poverty schools where they face multiple disparities, including less access to academic offerings. Education has ongoing efforts to collect data that it uses to identify potential discrimination and disparities across key groups of students. Justice is a party to 178 federal desegregation orders that remain open, but Justice does not track key summary information about the orders that would allow them to effectively monitor their status. Without systematically tracking such information, the agency may lack information that could help in its enforcement efforts. Justice said it is currently developing an electronic document management system that may allow more case-related information to be stored in electronic format. Justice also stated that our report fails to appreciate the extensive amount of data the agency maintains on its desegregation cases. We understand Justice’s need to maintain voluminous case-specific evidentiary files, some of which are maintained in hard copies. But Justice does not track such data across cases, because the data it collects are used to litigate each individual case. Justice said it is concerned that the report could be read to suggest that racial disparities within a public school district constitute per se evidence of racial discrimination. Justice said various terms in our recommendation, such as “systematically’ or “key” were not clear or well defined. It was out of recognition for the extensive nature of these files that we recommended Justice also have a way to track key, summary information across its cases. Such summary information would allow for timely and effective monitoring and for prompt reaction. Justice said in this case and in many others, it is engaged in a range of related activities, such as site visits and settlement agreements, which are not recorded on the courts’ docket sheets. Justice said it was concerned the report could be read to suggest that some cases have remained dormant or languished for long periods of time as a result of Justice’s tracking system. We have clarified in the report that data on disparities taken alone are insufficient to establish unlawful discrimination, Justice said. by achieving unitary status). In the draft report on which Justice commented, we stated that the onus is on the district, not Justice, to seek unitarystatus. We have amended the final report to state this more prominently. We acknowledge the key roles of the districts and the courts in resolving and advancing a desegregation case, but the focus of our report is on federal role. Justice, too, plays an important role in litigating these cases. We believe this role would be enhanced by improving its tracking of information about the cases.

Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. The objectives of this study were to examine: (1) how the percentage of schools with high percentages of poor and Black or Hispanic students has changed over time. We focused on Black and Hispanic students because they are the two largest minority groups in U.S. K-12 public schools. We measured poverty level at the school level using the percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. We analyzed schools with both the highest and lowest percentages of poverty and Blacks or Hispanics. We used Education’s Common Core of Data (CCD) from school years 2000-01, 2005-06, 2010- 11, and 2013-14. The data in the CCD represent the full universe of all U.S. K-12 public schools. The data are supplied by state education agency officials describing their schools and school districts. To further understand the trends underlying the growth or decline of these categories of schools, we examined the trends in state education agencies, as well as the state and local levels of education funding for each school. We reviewed technical documentation and interviewed relevant officials from Education. Based on these efforts, we determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. whether any variation in growth existed by region (Northeastern, Midwestern, Southern, and Western areas of the United States) and school type (traditional neighborhood schools, charter schools, and magnet schools) For our analysis of the CCD, we excluded schools that did not report information on (1) free or reduced-price lunch, which we used as a proxy to categorize the poverty level of the school. For school year 2000-01, we included 78,194 schools and excluded 16,520 schools. Non-sampling errors can be introduced in many ways. CCD’s coverage of traditional public schools and school districts is very complete. Coverage of publicly funded education outside of traditional school districts has varying levels of coverage within different states and jurisdictions. Some states do not report schools that are administered by state organizations other than state educational agencies. Examples include charter schools authorized by an organization that is not a school district, schools sponsored by health and human services agencies within a state, and juvenile justice facilities. The Civil Rights Data is part of Education’s overall strategy for administering and enforcing the federal civil rights statutes for which it is responsible. The data was collected from the full universe of all U.S. K-12 public schools in 2011-12. These data are also subject to non-sampling error, and because these data are self-reported, there is also the potential for misreporting of information. For these data, Education put in place quality control and editing procedures to reduce errors. suppression. To mitigate the potential for suppressions that distort aggregate totals, suppressed data were replaced with imputed data where possible. We selected a school district in each of three states (one in the Northeast, South, and West) and interviewed officials to describe why and how selected school districts have taken actions to address the diversity of their schools. Within these districts, the schools we visited were selected to include a mix of grade level (elementary, middle, and high school) and school type (traditional public and magnet) and a review of available information. We interviewed different stakeholders, such as school district superintendents, school board members, state education officials, community leaders, and school officials. We did not assess the extent to which the selected districts have achieved any diversity goals or complied with any applicable court orders. Because we selected the school districts judgmentally, we cannot generalize the findings about the actions officials took to address diversity to all school districts and schools nationwide. We assessed agencies’ actions using guidance on internal controls in the federal government related to oversight and monitoring. we used studies published between 2004 and 2014 on U.S. students, as these studies are more reflective of current students and their outcomes. We excluded from consideration some studies based on factors including outdated data, limited scope, or research methods that failed to control for multiple factors when assessing outcomes. The findings of the studies we identified are not representative of the findings of all studies looking at whether a school’s racial or socioeconomic composition affects student outcomes. This appendix contains the results of our additional analyses to examine trends and disparities among schools with different levels of poverty among students and Black or Hispanic students.

Summary:
The Social Security system is largely a pay-as-you-go system. By 2012, Social Security’s annual tax revenues are expected to be insufficient to cover its benefit payments. To cover the cash shortfall, the trust fund will begin drawing on the Treasury, first relying on its interest income and eventually drawing down its assets. The larger the retirement funds, the more investment earnings they would have and the more the rate of return on investments matters, the authors say. The prospect of building up retirement funds has brought increased attention to stock market investing. under government stock investing. Social Security’s cash deficit, beginning in 2012, would be financed from stock earnings and sales. The trust fund would be particularly vulnerable to losses in the event of a general stock market downturn. The only way for the Social Security trust fund to earn the higher returns possible with stock investing is to take on greater risk, the authors say.. Caution is warranted in counting on future stock returns in designing Social Security reform, they say. The results of these simulations illustrate some outcomes associated with two investment alternatives. They are not intended to represent the full range of possible outcomes. There is no guarantee that investing in the stock market, even over 2 or 3 decades, will yield the long-term average return. Over the past 70 years or so, stock returns were negative in nearly 1 out of 4 years. With government stock ownership, the risk and potential returns would be shared collectively by workers. But even if future stock returns are lower than the historical average of 7 percent, the conventional wisdom is that stock returns will be higher than those on Treasury securities over the long term. Individual accounts proposals would fundamentally alter the role of Social Security as a social insurance program. Reform proposals that use government managed accounts would constrain investment choices to reduce the risks that individuals could take. Under proposals that place few restrictions on investment choices, investors could take much greater risks and potentially earn greater returns. Some individuals could do very well under such an approach, but others could experience a significant drop in their expected retirement income. In the short term, under current budget scoring rules, government stock investing would increase reported budget figures. deficits or decrease budget surpluses because stock purchases would be treated as outlays. Each dollar invested in stocks is a dollar no longer available to the Treasury to finance other government spending or reduce debt held by the public. Depending on how much the trust fund were to invest in stocks, the change in the reported deficit/surplus could exceed $100 billion annually. Over the long term, the impact of government stock investing on reported budget deficits/surpluses could largely be neutral. Critics have expressed concern about increased government involvement in financial markets and corporate affairs. For stock selection, proponents of government stock investing typically recommend investing in a broad-based stock index. Most of the cost of managing an index fund is incurred maintaining thousands of individual accounts. The government, as a single investor, would incur negligible costs as a percentage of its assets, he says. But he says individual accounts’ proponents argue that administrative costs would be consistent with the costs of existing private retirement investment accounts. as forecasts and do not represent the full range of possible outcomes for the Social Security trust fund.

Summary:
The VA offers a broad range of benefits to veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces. Certain criteria must be met to be eligible to receive any of the benefits. This report focuses on basic eligibility and entitlement requirements for former servicemembers for benefits administered by the VA. The VA uses a two-step process to evaluate claims for benefits. The claimant must prove that he or she is a bona fide veteran and verify certain related matters. and the veteran must prove entitlement to the particular benefit being sought. Health Service; or as a commissioned officer of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or its predecessors. Active service also includes a period of active duty for training during which the person was disabled or died from an injury or disease incurred or aggravated in the line of duty. Additional circumstances of service, and whether they are deemed to be active military service, are set out in law. For example, if on authorized travel to and from the performance of activeduty training or inactive duty forTraining, a person is disabled or dies. For people who enlisted prior to September 8, 1980, no minimum length of service is necessary to be considered a veteran for most VA benefits. The general requirement is the "full period" for which the servicemember was called or ordered to active duty or, if less, 24 months of continuous active duty. Several exceptions exist to this rule, including life insurance benefits, hardship discharges and persons retired or separated from service because of a service-related disability. If the veteran did not serve for the full period of active duty and served less than 24 months, and none of the statutory exceptions apply, then the veteran is not eligible for any benefit. veteran requires that the individual be discharged or released from military service "under conditions other than dishonorable" The VA often determines on a case-by-case basis whether the claimant's discharge qualifies. A bad conduct discharge from a special court-martial does not always disqualify the claimant. Veterans in prison and parolees may be eligible for certain VA benefits and must contact the VA to determine eligibility.. VA benefits are not provided to any veteran or dependent wanted for an outstanding felony warrant. was not in a combat zone. Those time periods not designated by Congress as wartime are considered to be peacetime. If a veteran served partly during wartime and partly during peacetime, the veteran meets the wartime criteria if he or she served 90 consecutive days. Congress has designated eight wartime periods: Indian Wars, Spanish-American War, Mexican Border Period, World War I, WWII, Korean Conflict, Vietnam Era and Vietnam Era. The Vietnam Era was designated on August 5, 1964, for veterans in service on December 31, 1946. Members of the National Guard and the reserve components must meet the same standards as other claimants. In many cases, however, they do not meet the active duty standard or length of service standard and are therefore ineligible for VA benefits. National Guard members also qualify as veterans for the purposes of VA benefits if they are disabled or die from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty. Under certain conditions Guard and reserve members may be eligible for education benefits (through the Reserve Educational Program) and home loans from the VA. P.L. 95-202 provides that service for the Armed Forces by a group of civilians or contractors be considered active service for benefits administered by the VA. If these groups are considered to be active duty by the Secretary, they are eligible to receive certain benefits, including health care. To date, only certain groups who participated in World War I and World War II have been accorded active duty status under this procedure. The regulations also established the Department of Defense Civilian/Military Service Review Board and Advisory Panel to review each application. Civilian groups granted veterans status pursuant to P.L. 95-202 are eligible for VA burial benefits including interment or inurnment in VA National Cemeteries. Merchant mariners are civilians who engage in certain maritime activities, such as the transportation of military equipment by sea, in support of the armed forces. The following groups are considered veterans for purposes of eligibility for all programs administered by the VA: U.S. Merchant Seamen who served on blockships insupport of Operation Mulberry in World War II; and American Merchant Marine personnel who served in oceangoing service.

Summary:
In October 2004, Congress included a provision in the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005. The legislation required the Secretary of Defense to develop a comprehensive policy for DOD on the prevention of and response to sexual assaults involving members of the Armed Forces. DOD has taken positive steps to respond to congressional direction by establishing policies and a program to prevent, respond to, and resolve reported sexual assault incidents involving servicemembers, and the Coast Guard, on its own initiative, has taken similar steps. Military Justice (UCMJ) and the Manual for Courts-Martial and include trial by court-martial. In determining how to dispose of alleged sexual assault offenders, commanders take into account a number of factors. DOD’s directive and instruction may not adequately address how to implement the program when operating in deployed or joint environments. Training is not consistently effective, although DOD and the Coast Guard require that all servicemembers receive periodic training on their respective sexual assault prevention and response programs. programs. In reviewing DOD’s program, we found that the military services encountered challenges providing requested data because the request to do so was made after the start of the data collection period. We believe that this lack of a common means of presentation for reporting purposes has prevented users of the reports from making meaningful comparisons or drawing conclusions from the reported numbers. Without access to such information, DOD does not have the means to identify those factors, and thus to fully execute its oversight role, including assessing trends. The Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 required that the Defense Task Force on Sexual Assault in the Military Services conduct an examination of matters relating to sexual assault in cases in which members of the Armed Forces are either victims or offenders. As part of its examination, the law directs the task force to assess, among other things, DOD’s reporting procedures, collection, tracking, and use of data on sexual assault by senior military and civilian leaders. The law does not require an assessment of the Coast Guard's program. task force’s findings to evaluate the effectiveness of DOD’S sexual assault prevention and response programs. As of July 2008, this task force has yet to begin its review. Senior task force staff members attributed the delays to challenges in appointing the task force members and member turnover. They also told us that they project that by the end of fiscal year 2008 DOD will have expended about $15 million since 2005 to fund the task forces’ operations, such as salaries for the civilian staff members. the Secretary of Defense and the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force no later than 1 year after beginning its examination. If such a goal were met, the task force’s evaluation could be complete by August 2009. We expect to make a number or recommendations in our final report to improve implementation and oversight of sexual assault prevention and response programs in both DOD and the Coast Guard.

Summary:
In November 2002, Congress passed and the President signed the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA), which was later amended by IPERA. The amended legislation requires executive branch agencies to identify programs and activities that may be susceptible to significant improper payments. Five years after the implementation of IPERA, 15 of the 24 agencies were reported as noncompliant under IPERA for fiscal year 2015. We found that the IGs’ compliance determinations for fiscal 2015 were not based on a consistent government-wide approach. improper payments. For example, certain IGs reported increases in improper payment rates because of factors such as improved sampling and emphasis on training. Significant improvements in sampling, training, and the ability to detect improper payments could considerably reduce the likelihood that an improper payment will be made, the VA says. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) IG reported in its fiscal year 2015 report that 2 VA programs—Community Care and Purchased Long-Term Services and Support—reported improper payment rate of 54.77 percent and 59.14 percent, respectively. agency will meet a predetermined reduction target or report an improper payment rate below 10 percent. For the past 5 years, IGs reported that there were 11 agencies that did not meet the IPERA criterion that required agencies to publish and meet reduction targets. For fiscal year 2015, 4 of the 11 agencies were compliant with the remaining five IPERA criteria. The IGs were not consistent with one another regarding how they determined and reported on compliance when issues were identified, we found. We found that the types of issues identified for both the compliant and noncompliant agencies were similar. We found that the variations in the IGs’ determinations reduce their usefulness for comparing compliance and progress across agencies. We identified 5 IGs that reported their respective agencies (DOD, GSA, OPM, USDA, and HUD) as compliant despite finding issues with the corrective action plans. For the two remaining IPERA criteria, which required agencies to publish and meet reduction targets and report improper payment rates below 10 percent, IGs consistently made pass/fail determinations. As shown in table 1, the number of agencies reported as noncompliant with this IPERA criterion could have decreased by 3 (from 5 to 2 agencies) or increased by 6 (from 4 to 10 agencies), respectively. The total annual number of IG-reported recommendations made by the 24 agencies’ IGs has stayed relatively steady for the IGs’ fiscal years 2011 through 2015 IPERA compliance reviews. The number of recommendations per agency varied from as little as no recommendations for one agency to 49 recommendations for another agency. One potential reason could be the extent to which the agencies were compliant under IPERA over the past 5 years. The majority of the open recommendations were made in the past 2 years, and the agencies may not have had sufficient time to address them. implement the necessary corrective actions, there was 1 recommendation from fiscal year 2011 that was still open at the time of our review. The open recommendations address a number of improper payment issues. Until HHS develops an improper payment estimate for TANF, HHS will continue to be reported as noncompliant with the IPERA criteria that agencies publish improper payment estimates and corrective action plans for all susceptible programs. In a June 2016 letter to Congress, HHS stated that it wanted to work with Congress to address a set of issues related to accountability and how funds are used. including compliance under IPERA. We reviewed the open recommendations for the 15 agencies reported as noncompliant for fiscal year 2015. If the agencies take the necessary corrective actions to address the IGs’ open recommendations, the number ofnoncompliant agencies could decrease in future fiscal years, if no new compliance issues arise. In addition, as shown in figure 11, recommendations designed to address noncompliance with certain IPERA criteria were closed by some IGs after their fiscal year2015 compliance reports were issued. 15 of the 24 CFO Act agencies were reported as noncompliant under IPERA for fiscal year 2015. The total amount of estimated improper payments reported government- wide has been estimated to total over $1.2 trillion from fiscal year 2003 through fiscal year 2016. The inconsistencies in IGs’ determinations of noncompliance may present potentially misleading information to individuals and entities interested in comparative government-wide compliance, the authors say. The authors recommend that the Director of OMB coordinate with CIGIE to develop and issue guidance. SSA, as well as from the IGs for DHS and HUD. These letters are reprinted in appendixes VIII through XIII. OMB’s liaison to GAO stated in an e-mail that they had no comments on the report or the recommendation to coordinate with CIGIE to develop guidance. We also received technical comments from the Department of Commerce, HHS, HUD, State, Treasury, EPA, NSF, SBA, and SSA, which we incorporated in the report as appropriate. of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date.

Summary:
Sen. Jeff Sessions asked Chuck Hagel about the Obama Administration's plans for the next steps in nuclear arms control. Hagel did not accept Senator Sessions' view that future reductions in U.S. nuclear weapons should occur only through the treaty-making process. President Obama views New START, which was signed by the United States and Russia in April 2010, as "just one step on a longer journey" The United States signed several formal arms control treaties that limited the numbers of deployed nuclear weapons with the Soviet Union during the Cold War. President Bush did not notify Congress or seek congressional approval before pursuing these reductions. President George W. Bush also withdrew from deployment a number of U.S. nonstrategic nuclear weapons, although he did so without seeking or expecting reciprocity from Russia. Several Presidents have reduced unilaterally the number of warheads in the U.s. stored stockpile, as the United States has retired older weapons and responded to changing assessments of the necessary size and size of the arsenal. Following Article II of the Constitution, the Senate reviewed these treaties and voted to provide its advice and consent to ratification. structure of the U.S. nuclear force. These changes are a part of the normal force planning process, managed by the Department of Defense and approved by the President. They have also occurred without prior explicit approval from Congress. This report reviews these characteristics and demonstrates their effect on decisions about the use of the different mechanisms. The report also describes the role of Congress in the arms control process. It then provides an analytic framework that reviews the characteristics of theDifferent mechanisms, focusing on issues such as balance and equality. This report does not address the question of whether the United States should pursue further reductions in deployed nuclear weapons. While many in Congress disagree with the Administration's plans for further reductions, that goal is its stated policy. The report will evaluate these mechanisms only in the context of reductions in U.S. and Russiannuclear weapons. It will not evaluate whether other nations—such as China, the United Kingdom, and France—should participate in these reductions or which mechanism would be appropriate if other nations do. During the Cold War, arms control played a key role in the relationship between the U.S. and Soviet Union. Arms control negotiations were often one of the few channels for formal communication between the two nations. The United States and Russia deploy far greater numbers of nuclear weapons than these other nations, so they may be able to reduce their weapons further before bringing other nations into the process. Some argued that the agreements merely codified existing force structure plans and restricted the U.,S. ability to respond to emerging threats. The 1972 Anti-ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty continued to limit it to 100 interceptors deployed at one specific location. There was little evidence that the Soviet Union sought to evade the limits in the treaties in any systematic way. The United States and Soviet Union also used arms control negotiations, and the resulting treaties, as a way to limit or reduce the specific weapons systems that were being used by the two countries. The U.S. continued its interest and expanded its research into extensive land-based and space-based defenses. they viewed as threatening and destabilizing. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Soviet Union deployed intermediate range missiles that could reach critical targets in NATO. With both sides fearing a first strike from the other, each had an incentive to reduce the threat. As a result, they negotiated the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which eliminated all intermediate-range nuclear missiles. In a similar way, the U.S. and NATO agreed to end the use of cruise missiles in Europe. vein, throughout the Cold War, U.S. analysts expressed concerns about the Soviet force of large "heavy" intercontinental ballistic missiles. Analysts feared that the Soviet Union might consider using these weapons in a "disarming" first strike. The United States sought to mitigate concerns by deploying many of its warheads at sea, on invulnerable submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) But it also sought to limit and reduce the numbers of large ICBMs in the Soviet Force through arms control agreements. The bilateral treaties between the United States and Soviet Union did not contain any limits or restrictions on shorter-range nuclear weapons. Both nations were free to adjust the numbers, types, and deployment areas for these weapons. These treaties also did not limit the numbers of extra warheads that either side could retain in storage, in a "nondeployed" stockpile. Each nation was also free to determine, for itself, how many spare warheads it needed and how and when to add these warheads to its deployed forces. The U.S. began to reduce these forces in the late 1970s. The number of deployed warheads declined from more than 7,000 in the mid-1970s to below 6,000. These reductions occurred, for the most part, because officials believed they could maintain deterrence with fewer, but more modern, weapons. In 1970, NATO allies agreed in 1970 that the United States should deploy new intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe. In 1983, in the Montebello Decision, when the NATO defense ministers approved additional weapons modernization plans, they also called for the removal of older nuclear weapons. The number of U.S. nonstrategic nuclear weapons dropped sharply in the waning days of the Cold War, falling to fewer than 1,000 warheads by the mid-1990s. The Pentagon implemented these reductions as a part of its regular force planning process; it did not seek or need the approval of Congress. President Bush indicated that the United States would take these steps unilaterally, and would implement these measures regardless of the Soviet reaction. In addition, President Bush identified and adopted these steps without consulting with or notifying the Soviets. The U.S. maintains a stockpile of warheads in storage that are not deployed with operational delivery systems. Many of these warheads are awaiting dismantlement, but some remain active and could return to the force. The United States and Soviet Union never counted these warheads under the limits in arms control treaties. As a result, the United States has implemented all of the reductions in its stockpile unilaterally. and without congressional approval, says David Rothkopf, president of the Federation of American Atomic Energy. During the 1990s, as the relationship between the United States and Russia improved, their cooperation expanded to include a wide range of economic, political, and military issues. As a result, arms control negotiations no longer played a central role in fostering cooperation between the two nations. Nevertheless, as Table 2 indicates, the U.S. and Russia have negotiated three arms control treaties since 1992. Two of these have entered into force, but the two governments have not yet agreed on further reductions in strategic forces. In the 1990s, many analysts believed the U.S. no longer needed arms control to limit the Russian threat. George W. Bush pledged to set aside the arms control negotiating process. The Bush Administration eventually altered its approach and agreed to negotiate with Russia. As a result, the Bush Administration agreed to codify its proposed limits in the 2002 Strategic Reductions Treaty, which became known as the Moscow Treaty. But this treaty did not contain any detailed descriptions of the limited or limited definitions of the weapons to be limited. The U.S. and Russia began negotiations on a New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty in May 2009. The goal was not only to "reset" the relationship, but also to negotiate further reductions in the numbers of deployed strategic warheads. A negotiated agreement would allow the United States and Russia "to preserve stability at significantly reduced force levels," the Obama Administration said in a 2010 Nuclear Posture Review report. But large disparities in nuclear capabilities may not be conducive to maintaining a stable, long-term strategic relationship, the report said. The U.S. and Russia signed the New START Treaty on April 10, 2010. The treaty entered into force on February 5, 2011. The Obama Administration views New START as the first step on a path to deeper reductions in the numbers of deployed strategic nuclear weapons. President Obama emphasized this point in March 2012, when he said: My administration's nuclear posture recognizes that the massive nuclear arsenal we inherited from the cold war is poorly suited to today's threats, including nuclear terrorism. The United States and Russia did not sign New START until April 2010. Even after new START, the United States will still have more than 1,500 deployed nuclear weapons and some 5,000 warheads. President Obama confirmed his commitment to reduce U.S. nuclear weapons further during a speech in Berlin on June 19, 2013. He stated that he believes the. United States can maintain its security, and that of its allies, with reductions of up to one-third in. the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads. He further indicated that he would seek negotiated reductions with Russia to move beyond Cold War nuclear postures. The Clinton Administration altered the readiness of some of the remaining weapons, but it did not recommend or implement any further reductions in the number of U.S. nuclear weapons deployed in Europe. According to unclassified reports, the George W. Bush Administration did implement further reductions. Some reports indicate the weapons were withdrawn from Greece and Ramstein Air Base in Germany between 2001 and 2005. In addition, reports indicate that the United States withdrew its nuclear weapons from the RAF Lakenheath air base in the United Kingdom in 2006. approval from Congress before implementing these changes. The Obama Administration believes that the United States and NATO should seek an agreement with Russia before changing the size and structure of the U.S. force of nonstrategic nuclear weapons deployed in Europe. The Administration indicated that the Navy would retire its stockpile of nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles. The George H. W. Bush Administration had removed these missiles from surface ships and attack submarines as a part of the 1991 PNIs. The Clinton and Bush administrations had retained these missiles, and the capability to restore them to submarines. The U.S. stockpile of nondeployed nuclear weapons stood at almost 14,000 warheads in 1992. By 1994, the number of warheads in the stockpile had declined to about 11,000, a reduction of around 50% from the stockpile that had existed at the beginning of the George H.W. Bush Administration. In 2000, the stockpile remained at about 10,600 nonde deployed warheads in 2000. In 2009, the Obama Administration released an unclassified summary of the size of the U.s. stockpile, showing a decline of nearly 60% from 2000. Senate committees would hold hearings, craft a resolution of ratification, and vote on that resolution. The resolution would require a two-thirds majority to pass. If the U.S. and Russia were to alter New START with changes that imposed a legally-binding obligation on the United States, it seems likely that the President would need to submit these proposed amendments to the Senate for its advice and consent. The Senate emphasized this point in Declaration 9 of the Resolution of Ratification to New START, when it stated "that any agreement or understanding which in any material way modifies, amends, or reinterprets United States or Russian obligations" A congressional-executive agreement would not require the advice and consent of the Senate. Instead, the agreement would be authorized by means of a statute approved by both houses of Congress. The 1961 Arms Control and Reduction Act generally bars the Executive from taking action that would "obligate" the United States to reduce armaments in a military significant manner unless such action takes the form of a treaty or is affirmatively authorized by Congress. In other words, the Senate expects any future arms control agreement to come to the Senate as a treaty, not to the whole of Congress as an executive agreement. Under the executive branch interpretation of ACDA, a document that contained a political, but not legally-binding, commitment would not require the advice and consent of the Senate. The document could make its intent clear with a distinct statement indicating that it was only politically binding. Even if it did not include a specific statement, the agreement could make it clear with other language that each side was simply declaring its own intentions. For example, they could state that they intended to record those intentions in a joint statement. The United States and Russia have concluded politically binding statements within the framework of previous arms control agreements. If the Obama Administration sought to reduce U.S. nuclear weapons unilaterally, or in parallel with Russia without a legally-binding agreement, Congress could still exercise oversight of the process. Congress could also used funding decisions to influence the arms control process. For example, in 1968 and 1968 and.to reduce their forces even though they were not obligated to do so. Numerous Administrations have claimed that the President has the authority to reach such agreements without congressional authorization. 1969, Congress tried, unsuccessfully, to reduce funding for the emerging U.S. Sentinel and Safeguard anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems. In 1972, the United States and Soviet Union signed the ABM Treaty, which restricted each side to two sites for its ABM systems. Congress also sought to influence the arms control process with funding restrictions in the latter half of the1990s. During the 1994 Nuclear Posture Review, the Defense Department had decided that during the 1994 nuclear posture review, the Pentagon would not fund the Sentinel system. DOD would retire all 50 Peacekeeper ICBMs and four if its eighteen Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines to meet the START II limits. These decisions were incorporated in DOD's budget plans, even though START II had not entered into force. Congress stated that "funds available to the Department of Defense may not be obligated or expended during fiscal year 1997 for retiring or dismantling" The funding limitation could be waived if START II entered into Force, but, even in that case, funding could not be used "to implement any agreement or understanding" of these systems. Congress passed the legislation to provide the Russian parliament with an incentive to approve the START II Treaty. The Clinton Administration sought to ease the restriction in subsequent years as the budgetary cost to retain aging systems increased. Congress included similar provisions in the Defense Authorization Bills for FY1999, FY2000, and FY2001. It did, however, repeal this language for the Bush Administration in the FY2002 Defense Bill, after the 2001 Nuclear Posture Review called for the elimination of the restrictions. The legislation recognized that the President could reach a politically-binding agreement with Russia to accelerate the implementation of the Treaty, but he would have to report to Congress about the agreement. Congress has sought to prevent the President from reducing U.S. nuclear forces below the limits in New START. New START does not require the elimination of any warheads or gravity bombs. Congress did not include this language in the final version of the NDAA for 2014 ( H.R. 3304) The legislation did not withhold funding for the implementation of New START pending the completion of that report or a restoration of lost funding. The legislation in the late 1990s sought to limit the President's ability to reduce nuclear weapons below legally-binding treaty obligations. ), but, as noted above, it did express its view that further reductions should occur through the treaty process. Some of these characteristics may weigh more heavily than others at different times, reflecting conditions in the international security environment and domestic political environment. Analysts have debated, over the years, about whether balance and equality contribute to stability and reduce the risk of nuclear war. Others support the idea that, in seeking a measure of balance, arms control agreements can lock nations into force structures that might become destabilizing over time. In the 1990s, the United States and Russia continued to negotiate formal arms control treaties. Authors: The value placed on balanced and equal limits served as a symbol of "political balance" In 2009, the Obama Administration argued that a measure of balance and equality was important for stability. The Obama Administration has indicated that it would like the next nuclear arms control treaty to cover deployed strategic nuclear weapons, nonstrategic nuclear weapons and nondeployed nuclear weapons. Instead, Russia would like to negotiate an agreement that would limit U.S. ballistic missile programs. seeks to evade treaty-imposed limits. The level of detail, and, therefore, the amount of predictability, included in arms control treaties grew during the 1970s and 1980s. In contrast, the United States and Russia never codified the reductions outlined in the 1991 PNIs in a formal treaty, or in any other bilateral document. Each side simply announced the reductions in presidential speeches. As a result, they did not provide details on how they would reduce their weapons systems. Predictability between the United States and Russia may be far less important today than it was during the Cold War. Both force levels and the risk of war are far lower than they were at that time. Some experts argue that, "there is no conceivable situation in the contemporary world in which it would be in either country's national security interest to initiate a nuclear attack against the other side" The U.S. and Russia cooperate across many policy areas and maintain many channels for communication; they share information about their nuclear force structure plans. the other's force, both sides have limited flexibility to increase their forces or alter their composition. On the other hand, unilateral U.S. nuclear reductions allow the United States to set the size and structure of its nuclear force. The United States took advantage of this flexibility when it reduced its nonstrategic forces unilaterally in 1991. In 2001, the Bush Administration preference in 2001 for unilateral reductions in U.s. strategic nuclear forces, says Peter Bergen, a nuclear weapons expert at the University of California, Los Angeles. nuclear weapons, they can occur when the U.S. identifies excess weapons and has the capacity to dismantle them. Treaties, on the other hand, often set an arbitrary time line for weapons eliminations, which can add to the costs and increase the complexity of the process. If nations reduce their forces unilaterally, even if they do so in parallel, they could eventually undermine stability. If either party, fearing that the other was about to add to its forces, sought to reverse its reductions quickly, the other might feel insecure or threatened. Each side could structure its forces the way it wanted and reduce them at its own pace. The New START Treaty retains some of these flexible provisions. It contains an aggregate limit on the total number of deployed warheads and delivery vehicles, but it does not impose sublimits on particular systems. The two sides exchange substantial amounts of data about the numbers, locations, and characteristics of their deployed delivery vehicles. They also conduct up to 18 inspections each year to confirm this data. But the treaty does not contain specific counting rules that attribute a number of warheads to each type of delivery system. U.S. and Russia could exchange reciprocal statements about their intentions. They could also exchange data and possibly permit visits or inspections. This is similar to the type of regime the George W. Bush Administration proposed in 2008. Russia rejected the proposal, and indicated that it could not permit data exchanges and inspections unless they were part of a legally binding agreement, writes David Rothkopf. But if both sides support further reductions, each prefers to maintain a greater degree of flexibility, he says. The arms control process has played a key role in providing the participating nations with access to and an understanding of the military forces and activities of the other party. Even a formal treaty that focuses on transparency and confidence-building measures, may be sufficient to provide a measure of predictability. The absence of agreement on transparency measures, whether to monitor negotiated reductions or to account for unilateral adjustments, could undermine predictability, authors say. For example, a nation may choose to adjust its forces unilaterally, rather than through negotiated limits, precisely because it does not want to provide access to information about its forces. U.S. and Russia have never included limits on stored, nondeployed warheads in formal treaties. The United States has reduced this stockpile unilaterally over the years. The risks created by intrusive monitoring needed to verify compliance with negotiated reductions may be greater than the benefits created by the predictability of balanced limits on the weapons, the authors say. The U.S., Russia have occasionally exchanged information on the progress of implementing the PNIs, but this cooperation lacked the rigor of information required by arms control treaties. President Bush did not seek new transparency measures in the 2002 Moscow Treaty. Obama Administration offered a different view on the value of transparency in arms control. It indicated that one of the key reasons that it sought to negotiate a new Treaty with Russia in 2009 was to maintain monitoring and verification capabilities of the 1991 START Treaty. The Administration has not responded to requests for comment on this article from The Associated Press. The article was originally published in The New York Times, which has since been updated with comments from the Obama Administration. NATO stressed its support for transparency and cooperation on nuclear weapons in its approach to possible limits on U.S. and Russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons. In most cases, it is likely to take far longer to reduce nuclear forces through a bilateral arms control treaty than it would through a treaty. In its 2012 Deterrence and Defense Posture Review, NATO indicated that the allies "look forward to continuing to develop and exchange transparency and confidence-building ideas with the Russian Federation" to increase "mutual understanding" of NATO's and Russia's nuclear force postures in Europe. The United States and Soviet Union took over nine years to negotiate the original START Treaty. In contrast, the George H.W. Bush Administration developed the list of measures for the 1991 PNIs in under a month. Delays between the signing of a treaty and its entry into force are not inevitable. Parties may slow formal negotiations in response to bilateral political difficulties, disputes over the details of the treaty, or other unforeseen events. But a unilateral, Presidential decision to alter U.S. nuclear forces is likely to be reached more quickly. Several factors can lengthen the amount of time before arms control treaties enter into force. These include the time needed for the legislative body to review and evaluate the terms of the treaty. International events that are either related or unrelated to the subject matter of the Treaty can also slow or stop the arms control process. For example, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan disrupted U.S.-Soviet relations and contributed to the failure of the 1979 SALT II Treaty. More recently, the break-up of the Soviet Union delayed the ratification of both the 1991 START Treaty and the 1993 START II treaty. The parties negotiated a Protocol to START so that Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan could join Russia as successors to the Soviet Union for the Treaty. START entered into force on December 4, 2004, nearly 3.5 years after signature. Although the United States and Russia signed START II in January 2003, the U.S. Senate waited until START entry into force before beginning hearings on START II. The Senate then delayed its vote on the treaty until January 1996. The legislative debate on formal arms control treaties could also be delayed by debates between the executive and legislative branches on issues related to, but not covered within, the treaty. Unilateral adjustments in nuclear forces would not be exempt from legislative review. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees receive testimony on U.S. nuclear weapons plans and programs during the annual authorization and appropriations process. Formal arms control treaties contain lengthy implementation periods that may not be present in unilateral measures. Although they eliminated many weapons more quickly than mandated by the Treaty, neither the START Treaty nor the START II Treaty allowed seven years for the parties to reduce their forces. But this would only slow the process of implementing reductions if Congress refused to appropriate necessary funds. The 1993 START II Treaty, which, as noted, never entered into force, initially mandated that the United States and Russia complete their reductions by the beginning of 2003. In September 1997, after delays in the ratification process, the two nations agreed to extend the elimination period to the end of 2007. In some cases, a long implementation process may be necessary because it can take a significant amount of time for the nations to comply with the detailed elimination procedures. Such a process also allows each nation to be certain that the other is meeting its obligations before it eliminates its. Some argue that U.S. should reduce nuclear weapons to New START levels in fewer than seven years. Peter Bergen: A lengthy time frame may add to the cost of nuclear weapons. He says it would be difficult to agree on the contents of a treaty that imposed balanced and equal limits. Bergen says if the United States and Russia agree to reduce their forces further while New START remains in force, they could rely on the definitions and monitoring provisions in New START to retain a degree of predictability. U.S. and Russia have taken preliminary steps to prepare for another round of arms control negotiations. There is widespread agreement that the formal arms control process has stalled. If the two nations agree to reduce their strategic nuclear weapons further, they could rely on the monitoring and verification provisions in New START. But they would either have to leave nonstrategic and nondeployed weapons outside the framework of a new agreement or, if they counted them in the limits, would have to accept less transparency about the numbers and locations of those weapons.

Summary:
Department of Agriculture’s Forest Service manages about 192 million acres of land. In fiscal year 1996, revenue generated from the sale or use of resources and lands within the National Forest System totaled about $0.9 billion. The Forest Service is required to plan for six renewable surface uses—outdoor recreation, rangeland, timber, watersheds and water flows, wilderness, and wilderness. The motto is “caring for the land and serving people.” The Forest service manages about 30 percent of all federal lands. Under the Organic Administration Act of 1897, the national forests are to be established to improve and protect the forests within their boundaries. The Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 added the uses of outdoor recreation, range, watershed, and fish and wildlife. The act also requires the agency to manage its lands to provide high levels of all of these uses to current users while sustaining undiminished the lands’ ability to produce these uses for future generations. In addition, the agency’s regulations require the Forest Service to consider the production of nonrenewable subsurface resources. of the forests and (2) maintain the diversity of plant and animal communities. The Forest Service is subject to more than 200 laws affecting its activities and programs. Many laws governing national forest management and planning, dating back to the Organic Administration Act of 1897, have implied or stated that economics should be included in managing the national forests. Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 (known as RPA) requires the Forest Service to periodically analyze trends in supply and demand and to report on investment opportunities. amended, generally require federal agencies to obtain fair market value for the use of federal lands for rights-of-way for oil and gas pipelines, power lines, and communications lines. Title V of the Independent Offices Appropriation Act of 1952, as amended, authorizes agencies to issue regulations to assess a fair fee for a service or thing of value provided to an identifiable recipient beyond that provided to the general public. When providing special services, such as reviewing and processing permits or leases, federal agencies are to recover the costs of providing the services, resources, or goods. goods, resources, or services provided. Under the provisions of the Independent Offices Appropriation Act and OMB Circular A-25, federal agencies are to obtain fair market value in the absence of specific legislation to the contrary. The Forest Service is prohibited by law from obtaining a fair return for certain goods or recovering costs for certain services. The agency provides recreation through numerous recreation facilities that it manages directly, including about 3,000 campgrounds, over 120,000 miles of hiking trails and thousands of picnic areas and boating sites. on the Budget has an ongoing interest in the Forest Service’s management of the nation’S 155 forests. To assist the Committee in its deliberations and oversight, the Chairman asked us to identify the lessons that can be learned from efforts by nonfederal land managers to generate revenue and/or become financially self-sufficient from the sale or use of natural resources on their lands. To identify legal and other barriers that may preclude the Forest service from implementing similar efforts on its lands, we relied extensively on prior GAO reports. aside other lands, programs, or functions for non-revenue-generating activities, such as conservation, resource protection, and research. The department has also developed several programs to transfer, sell, or exchange trust lands that have a low capability of generating revenue. Between 1981 and 1994, the department transferred, sold, exchanged, purchased, or otherwise acquired 355,000 acres, or 11 percent of its land base. The state legislature provided funds to the department to fund these programs. International Paper manages Southlands Experiment Forest to generate revenue. Department of Natural Resources has converted more than 34,000 acres of drylands to higher revenue-producing lands. The company’s annual budget separates the forest’S research and policy functions from its revenue-generating timber operations. This separation reflects the company's recognition that the forest's research andpolicy functions sometimes require operational decisions that do not always make sense, the authors say. to compensate the trust for the fair market value of the lands transferred to conservation status. The White Mountain Apache tribe’s Fort Apache Indian Reservation, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints’ Deseret Land and Livestock ranch, and the Southlands Experiment Forest were managing game species as a profitable resource. About 25 percent of Southlands’ revenue is generated by recreational hunting. Although grazing revenue varies with such factors as weather conditions and the price of beef cattle, the livestock grazing programs on Deseret and The Nature have been successful in the past. Conservancy’s Niobrara Valley Preserve contributed significantly to the land units’ financial self-sufficiency. On average, livestock grazing provides at least 80 percent of Niob ranches’ total revenue. On Deseret, this management practice involves developing an annual written plan to set the time of year and limit the length of time that cattle are allowed to graze in an area. The ranches practice what is often referred to as “time-control” or ‘time-managed’ grazing. Trust lands managed by Washington State’s Department of Natural Resources are funded from total revenue. Since 1990, this practice has generated about $41 million in additional revenue at a cost of about $2 million in staff salaries. In fiscal year 1996, tree sales resulting from commercial thinning generated some $17 million in revenue. In addition, the department is also performing both precommercial and commercial. thinning, and, to a lesser extent, pruning and fertilizing timber stands to spur tree growth. Washington State's Department of Natural Resources has changed its timber appraisal system. Officials say they've stopped reimbursing contractors for constructing logging roads. They've also replaced oral bidding of timber sales with sealed bids to avoid artificially suppressing the highest bid value. The department has also pilot-tested contracting with a company to harvest timber and then having the department, rather than the company, market the logs. According to department officials, this last effort has increased the department’s return by eliminating the middle man. Since fiscal year 1994, managers of Texas state parks have increased entrance and campground fees, sometimes by 100 percent. The White Mountain Apache tribe charges fees for amenity-based recreation on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation. As a result, recreational fees provide a relatively stable source of revenue to the tribe. The tribe requires outdoor recreation permits to travel on the reservation’s unpaved roads. A park-generated net income grew from $14.8 million in 1993 to $18.5 million in 1995. use that the Forest Service is legislatively mandated to sustain. Water plays an important role in generating revenue from other uses, such as irrigating rangelands. Washington State’s Department of Natural Resources and the White Mountain Apache tribe have entered into agreements with federal regulatory agencies to reduce costs and to provide more regulatory certainty and predictability to revenue-generating timber and other programs. The agreement includes a “no surprise policy” under which the federal government will not ask for more land or mitigation funding from the state. institutional capability to ensure that economic activity does not have an adverse impact on species listed under the Endangered Species Act. Other efforts to increase net income through savings included reducing the number of salaried employees by increasing the use of volunteers and prison inmates. In June 1997, the Secretary of the Interior signed an order that clarifies the responsibilities of the Department. The order contains a provision stating that the United States defers to tribal conservation management plans. Both federal regulatory and tribal officials agree that these agreements will greatly reduce the time and costs associated with accommodating environmental objectives. employees and increased the number of campground volunteers and hosts. They also increased their use of prison inmates to perform routine cleaning, renovation, and improvements at park facilities. In fiscal year 1995, volunteers donated about 490,000 hours of work valued at $2.6 million, equal to the work of about 238 full-time employees. The estimated value of the inmates’ labor was about $ 2.4 million over 2 fiscal years, according to Texas Parks Division officials. None of the approaches or techniques for increasing revenue or decreasing costs used by the nonfederal land managers were legislatively mandated or otherwise required. The primary goal of private businesses, such as the Deseret Land and Livestock ranch and International Paper, is to make a profit. Having a clear mission priority to generate long-term sustainable revenue has produced similar results for public agencies. For example, trust lands and programs managed by Washington State’s Department of Natural Resources are funded from total revenue and generate considerable net income for the designated trust beneficiaries. The need to generate revenue for other mission-related goals and objectives can also provide an incentive. entrepreneurial ideas or conduct research to increase profits and (2) choose where and when to apply the results. One result has been that they have tailored their approaches and techniques for generating revenue or reducing costs to their particular geographical areas or conditions. This freedom to make choices is often accompanied by oversight by the parent organization, the beneficiaries of the revenue generated, or others to ensure accountability for expenditures and results. For example, the managers of the Deseret Land and Livestock ranch and the Southlands Experiment Forest have the freedom to try innovative approaches to increase net income. designated trust beneficiaries, including state school districts, colleges, and universities, as well as other public agencies and charitable institutions within the state. When the department makes a decision that may reduce current income and return on investment over the short term, it must show these beneficiaries that it has exercised skill and care in protecting trust resources. Washington State’s Department of Natural Resources also has two initiatives under way that address accountability. One is the Asset Stewardship Program, which is to look at the current and possible future mix of assets. to determine which mix will best generate long-term revenue for the trust beneficiaries. The agency also hopes to develop a longer-term management framework that will give its managers flexibility to respond to future population and other changes that affect the management of state lands and programs. The second effort is the department’s March 1997 long- Term Strategic Plan. It sets out major goals, objectives, and specific strategies to achieve them. The plan (1) will be consistent with a statewide performance budgeting system now being developed. Generating revenue and reducing costs are not mission priorities for the agency, GAO says. Agency has reduced staffing from about 46,000 permanent positions in 1992 to 39,400 in 1996. Congressional expectations and revenue-sharing provisions serve as disincentives to either increasing revenue or decreasing costs, report says. Forest Service’s recent strategic plan contains no goals or performance measures for obtaining fair market value or for reducing or containing costs, it says. The agency is moving away from, rather than toward, financial self-sufficiency, it adds. Environmental and planning laws limit the Forest Service’s ability to generate revenue. Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act represents a congressional design to give greater priority to the protection of endangered species. The Forest Service bears the burden of demonstrating that its actions will not be likely to jeopardize listed species. Other laws enacted primarily during the 1960s and 1970s also establish minimum requirements for these components of natural systems. The act provides that maximizing returns or volume cannot be the only criterion for determining the harvesting system to be used. response to these requirements, the Forest Service has, during the last 10 years, increasingly shifted the emphasis under its broad multiple-use and sustained-yield mandate. In western Washington State, western Oregon, and northern California, 24.5 million acres of federal land were available for commercial timber harvesting. About 7.6 million acres, or 31 percent of the available acreage, have been set aside or withdrawn as habitat for species that live in old-growth forests. To protect the forests’ health, only limited timber harvesting and salvage timber are allowed. In recent years, legislative and administrative decisions have set aside or withdrawn an increasing percentage of Forest Service lands for conservation. Most of the federal acreage that has been set aside for conservation is located in 12 western states. In 1964, less than 9 percent (16 million acres) of the national forests’ acreage was managed as wilderness, wild and scenic rivers, and national monuments. By 1994, this figure had increased to 26 percent (almost 50 million acres). (See fig. 3.1.) of the importance of naturally functioning systems to the long-term sustainability of other forest uses, including timber production. An increasing recognition that past Forest Service management decisions have led to degraded aquatic habitats, declining populations of some wildlife species, and increased forest health problems. In addition, the thrust of the Forest Service’s timber sales program is changing from primarily supplying commercially valuable timber to the wood-using industry. The Forest Service is using timber sales as a “tool” for achieving land stewardship objectives that require manipulating the existing vegetation. Volume of timber sold from Forest Service lands in western Washington, western Oregon, and northern California has declined. Like the acreage available for timber harvesting, the acreages available for oil and gas leasing have declined. The Forest Service is prohibited by law from charging fees for the use of most recreational sites and areas. Compared with timber and minerals, recreation generates substantially less revenue, according to the Forest Service. The agency collected only about 7 cents per visit in receipts and special use fees in 1993. The Forest Service manages half of the nation’s big-game and coldwater fish habitat. Federal statutes and regulations have narrowly defined the instances in which the Forest Service can charge fees for noncommercial recreational activities. The agency generally defers to state laws regulating these activities, the authors say. For example, a hunter can pay over $24,000 on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation and up to $8,500 on the Deseret Land and Livestock ranch for a trophy bull elk. government receives no financial compensation for hardrock minerals extracted from Forest Service and other federal lands. 11 western states that lease state-owned lands for mining purposes impose a royalty on minerals extracted. In 1990, hard rock minerals worth at least $1.2 billion were extracted from federal lands, while known, economically recoverable reserves were valued at $64.9 billion. If the Congress were to adopt an 8-percent royalty on gross profits, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the government would receive $184 million. Congressional expectations and revenue-sharing provisions have sometimes served as disincentives to either increasing revenue or decreasing costs. Establishing annual output targets and sharing revenue that has been generated before deducting the costs of providing goods or services furnish two examples. When the Forest Service is allowed to retain a portion of the revenue it generates, it does so without deducting its costs, which are funded from annual appropriations. In fiscal year 1996, 41 states received about $481 million in revenue from the development of federal onshore minerals. The Forest Service has not always acted to contain costs, even when requested to do so by the Congress. Inefficiencies within the Forest Service’s decision-making process cost up to $100 million a year at the individual project level alone. Approved forest plans sometimes do not satisfy the requirements of environmental and planning laws. The Forest Service had not developed new regulations and a new contract that would limit the government's liability on new timber sales contracts and redistribute the risk on canceled contracts. Writers: Among Forest Service's mission priorities, reducing costs rank below protecting resources. They say Congress has provided agency with authority to obtain fair market value for goods. Writers: But Forest Service often has not done so, nor has it always acted to contain costs. They recommend Forest Service revise strategic plan to include goals and performance measures for obtaining fair marketvalue for goods, recovering costs for services, and containing expenses, to hold agency accountable for its performance. The Forest Service agreed with the report’s conclusions and recommendations, they say. by the nonfederal land managers to increase revenue and has reduced staffing. The agency has also reduced the number of federal employees on the land. The land is owned by non-federal agencies, such as the National Park Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. It is run by a non-profit organization called the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which has a contract with the federal government to run the land for the next 50 years. The federal government owns the land, which is managed by the non- federal agencies.

Summary:
The operation of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is among the subjects of legislative interest. Stakeholders have expressed concerns over a number of issues, including the USPTO's backlog of filed but unexamined applications. Some commentators believe that within an era of increasingly complex, fast-moving technology, the task of issuing quality patents on a consistent basis presents a considerable challenge to the USpTO. The USPto has actively engaged in efforts to address its issues. USPTO initiatives have responded to perceived concerns about the patenting process. The Patent Application Backlog Reduction Stimulus Plan allows an individual who has filed multiple pending applications to receive expedited review of one patent application when he agrees to withdraw another, unexamined application. The Enhanced First Action Interview Pilot Program, which allows participants to conduct an interview with the patent examiner early in the application review process, is also part of the USPTO's initiatives. The "Three-Track Initiative," under which applications would be placed into one of This report reviews a number of recent USPTO initiatives designed to enhance the patent application review process. It begins by offering a brief review of patent acquisition proceedings. The report then reviews the innovation policy issues that are implicated by patent administration policies. Finally, the report closes by reviewing possible congressional options to improve the patent system. The U.S. Constitution provides Congress with the power "To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to ... Inventors the exclusive Right to their ... Discoveries" An invention must meet four primary requirements to be patentable. The maximum term of patent protection is ordinarily set at 20 years. If the USPTO allows the patent to issue, its owner obtains the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing into the United States the patented invention. Those who engage in those acts without the permission of the patentee can be held liable for infringement, the authors say. The patent owners who wish to compel others to respect their proprietary interests must commence enforcement proceedings. The USPTO has admitted that "the volume of patent applications continues to outpace our capacity to examine them" Long delays for patent approvals may negatively impact high technology industries. For market segments that feature a rapid pace of innovation and short product cycles, such as consumer electronics, the delays may also significantly devalue the patent right. Many observers believe that if current conditions continue, the backlog and delay are likely to grow at the US PTO in coming years.. The Supreme Court enjoys discretionary authority to review cases decided by the Federal Circuit. Many observers believe that the USPTO should only issue patents on inventions that meet each of the statutory criteria. Quality patents are said to enhance predictability within the marketplace. Entrepreneurial speculators may find it easy to obtain patents that can then be enforced against manufacturers and service providers. The goal of consistently high levels of patent quality may pose a considerable challenge for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) The agency has hired many new examiners, including 1,193 in 2006; 1,215 in 2007; and 1,211 in 2008. The USPTO proposed rules with respect to claims and so-called continuing applications. These rules never came into effect due to a temporary court ruling enjoining their implementation. Inventors might also benefit from obtaining more prompt review of a particular patent application. The USPPO will continue to operate the Patent Application Backlog Reduction Stimulus Plan until December 31, 2011, or until 10,000 applications have received expedited review.. The remainder of this report reviews several of these programs. extending the Plan, however. Patents issued by the USPTO have no effect in other countries. For the most part, patents must be obtained on a nation-by-nation basis. An individual or firm that develops a new technology, and that seeks protection in more than one country, must therefore file multiple patent applications claiming the same invention. In turn, the patent offices of different nations must commit significant effort towards examining applications that are being submitted for patent protection in different countries. Patent Prosecution Highway (PPH) is an initiative intended to rationalize and expedite multinational patent acquisition. The PPH consists of a series of bilateral arrangements between the patent offices of a number of nations. Each participating patent office may also potentially benefit from the work previously done by another office. The USPTO has currently entered into PPH arrangements with over a dozen foreign patent offices, including the European Patent Office and the Patent Offices of Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Korea, and the United Kingdom. The USPTO has explored an alternative to this longstanding procedure though an "Enhanced First Action Interview Pilot Program" Applicants that choose to participate receive a Pre-Interview Communication providing the results of a technical literature search conducted by the examiner. The applicant may then conduct an interview with the examiner with the hope of expediting approval of the application. This program originally applied only to certain divisions of the USpTO, but was recently extended to cover the entire agency under the title "Full First Action interview Pilot Program." The USPto reports that this pilot program has yielded several benefits to participants. The USPTO recently announced a "Three-Track Initiative" that would place each patent application into one of three separate queues. Through this mechanism, inventors could pay a surcharge to obtain more prompt review of their applications; or alternatively delay examination and the payment of corresponding fees for those services. Under the proposal, an application would only be placed in one of the three tracks if it was originally filed in the United States. Applications that were originally filed abroad would not be docketed for examination at all. The disparate treatment of applications based on the office of first filing has also aroused controversy. According to the USPTO, this "proposal would increase the efficiency of examination of [foreign] applications" The U.S. is a signatory to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property and also a member state of the World Trade Organization. Even if the Three-Track Initiative is approved, it will not apply to foreign patent applications immediately, the patent office says. It will only apply to applications for which they are theOffice of First Filing. USPTO has for many years maintained an internal quality control group that monitors the quality of the patent examination process. In 2011, the USPTO endeavored to increase the effectiveness and transparency of its quality review procedure through the implementation of new metrics that measure patent quality. The new metrics have, for the most part, been positively received by the patent bar. Some observers have expressed concerns that "placing foreign nationals at a distinct disadvantage in their pursuit of patent rights in the U.S. ... could trigger, among other things, the imposition of new barriers" The 112 th Congress is engaged in extensive patent reform discussions. Two bills, H.R. 1249 and S. 23, would make a number of changes to current patent law. Reform proposals within these bills bear upon the ability of the USPTO to develop and implement new initiatives. Some commentators believe that certain of the metrics may not always reflect an accurate and efficient review of a patent application and have suggested that other metrics might also be introduced. The USPto has engaged in changes to its administrative practices to address concerns over its backlog. H.R. 1249 and S. 23 propose that the USPTO be given the authority to "set or adjust by rule any fee established or charged by the Office" Any fees set must, in the aggregate, cover the estimated costs of the agency's services. This capacity may provide the agency with heightened capability to develop new initiatives without need for congressional activity, the authors say. New realities within the intellectual property environment, including a growing number of patent applications, increasingly complex technologies, and heightened user demand for prompt and accurate patent services have encouraged the US PTO to innovate.

Summary:
Oil exploration and production in Iraq began in the 1920s under the terms of a wide-ranging concession granted to a consortium of international oil companies. Iraq's highest-ever production level of 3.5 million barrels per day (mbd) was reached in 1990 immediately prior to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Crude oil is the source of over 90% of Iraq's domestic energy consumption. International firms are not expected to begin to make investments and carry out substantial infrastructure work until after the Iraqi elections scheduled for March 2010. In late 2007, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) finalized its own regional oil and gas investment law. Under the terms of the KRG's model PSC, foreign firms manage oil production in given fields, recovering their costs from the sale of specific percentages of the oil produced. The KRG opposes proposals to require federal approval of its existing or future contracts, but notes that it is committed to revenue sharing as defined in the constitution. U.S. government efforts continue to encourage development of legal and regulatory frameworks for the oil sector. The SIGIR has reported that Iraq's operational funds for its Oil Ministry increased over 800% from 2008 to 2009 reaching the level of $950 million. Oil sector investment funding for 2009 remained roughly static at $2.2 billion. Observers have noted that significant investments in port, road, rail, water, and power infrastructure also are necessary in order for Iraq to achieve its ambitious oil production expansion targets. The main points of contention among Iraqi politicians and citizen groups with regard to energy policy include the main points. Iraqi, U.S., and other observers have expressed concern that the violence and political tension that have prevailed in Iraq in recent years have not been conducive to careful consideration of detailed hydrocarbon sector legislation. The Iraqi constitution's ambiguity about the roles and powers of federal, regional, and governorate authorities has fueled division. Disagreements between officials in the national government and the KRG continue to flare concerning the legality and terms of each government's oil contracts. It remains unclear whether the new interest among Iraqi leaders in resolving the dispute will be enough to reach an agreement. IMF: Iraq's public finances have been "fragile" in recent years. Iraqi government has "little room for fiscal slippage" until oil output increases. IMF estimated that Iraqi budget deficits in 2010 and 2011 would create a $5 billion financing gap after domestic resources have been tapped. U.S. to continue to assist Iraq with its request to the UN to extend related protections for energy proceeds and the DFI. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned in a January 2008 report that Iraq's finances were fragile. a planned Iraqi government bond issue and in part though recently negotiated external support agreements such as the IMF Stand-by Arrangement and World Bank loans. The central role of the oil sector in Iraq's economy, the uneven geographic distribution of Iraq's oil resources, and the legacy of communal favoritism practiced under Saddam Hussein have created lasting concerns among Iraqis about the future equitable distribution of oil revenues. While significant oil revenue may be available to Iraq over the medium term, its availability remains a function of both Iraq's production and export capacity and prevailing global market prices. An equitable, mutually accepted revenue distribution formula will be critically important to Iraq's future economic health and political stability. Article 112 of Iraq's constitution requires the Iraqi government to distribute revenues: in a fair manner in proportion to the population distribution in all parts of the country. Debate over distribution formulas reflects efforts to agree on quantitative terms for ensuring equitable per capita. The principal issues remain formulas for ensure equitable distribution of revenues to Iraq’s population and the mechanisms through which revenue will be collected and distributed. Distribution and providing for "damaged" and "unjustly deprived" regions in line with Article 112 of the constitution. At present, a baseline arrangement that sends 17% of revenues to the KRG has been reflected in recent budgets. The 2010 budget also includes a provision that will deliver $1 to producing governorates for each barrel of oil and refined fuel they produce. By all accounts, Iraq will have to meet significant logistical and technical requirements in order to expand its oil production to planned levels. Iraq has issued new decrees and reformed administrative bodies to grant greater contracting authority to ministries and provinces. U.S. and coalition budget assistance programs have been reorganized to improve coordination. The security of Iraq's oil infrastructure has improved markedly since 2007 because of the introduction of an infrastructure protection system that includes several Pipeline Exclusion Zones (PEZs) U.s.-funded components of the PEZ program were completed in late June 2008, according to the SIGIR and the Department of Defense. Iraq was a leading member of OPEC with a production quota that mirrored that of its neighbor, Iran. The introduction of significant Iraqi oil supplies onto the international market absent corresponding cuts in production from other OPEC or non-OPEC producers could exert downward pressure on global oil prices. As new oil infrastructure and pipelines are constructed to support Iraq's planned expansion of production, new investments in security infrastructure and security personnel will be necessary. The extent of needed investment will be determined in relation to the size and scope of the actual expansion and the broader security situation in Iraq. Section 3301 of the act states that no funds appropriated by the act or any other act may be used "to exercise United States control over any oil resource of Iraq" On July 12, 2007, the Administration released an interim report on the Iraq benchmarks. The September 2007 report stated that Iraq's government "has not made satisfactory progress toward enacting and implementing legislation to ensure the equitable distribution of hydrocarbon revenue" The report also stressed that "it is difficult to predict what further progress might occur" when Iraq's parliament reconvenes and considers proposed legislation. President Bush issued signing statements stating that the executive branch would "construe such provisions in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the President" Iraq's Council of Ministers (cabinet) approved a draft version of the hydrocarbon framework law in February 2007. Subsequent negotiations among Iraqi leaders sought to clarify the responsibilities of federal and regional authorities as well as contracting procedures for oil. The bill was passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate in 2008. The Senate passed the bill in 2009. On July 3, 2007, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki announced that the Council of Ministers had approved a final version of the framework law. Kurdish officials protested the changes, arguing that they are substantive, rather than semantic, and have tentatively withdrawn their support for the legislation. The boycott of cabinet and parliamentary proceedings by various Iraqi entities at the time of the cabinet's approval of the law added to the controversy surrounding the proposed legislation. As of November 2009, statements from Iraqi government officials and members of the. Council of Representatives suggest that parliamentary consideration of the legislation continues to be delayed by disagreements between key political figures. until the election of a new parliament in national elections scheduled for early 2010. The Council of Ministers reportedly is considering new draft legislation, but no timetable has been announced for its consideration. Skepticism about the performance of Oil Minister Shahristani appears to be significant within the Council of Representatives. opposition to the conduct of the investment bidding round conducted in July 2009 and to contracts signed by the Kurdistan Regional Government. As such the applicability of the compromises reached prior to the announcement of draft legislation may be in doubt. Federal Oil and Gas Council (FOGC) to determine all national oil and gas sector policies and plans. FOGC would become the most powerful body in Iraq's oil sector, with power to review all contracts. Some observers have warned that the makeup of the council could potentially contribute to sectarian or regional tensions. Draft would create two funds for oil revenues: first, an "Oil Revenue Fund," and the second, a "Future Fund" to hold an unspecified percentage of oil revenue for long-term development goals. piece of legislation following further negotiation among federal, regional, and governorate representatives. Ministry of Oil and Iraq National Oil Company Laws are necessary to ensure proper oversight, accountability, and separation of powers between the two entities. As of November 2009, a draft INOC law had been approved by the Council of Ministers, but was not considered by the House of Representatives before the 2010 national election. Under the hydrocarbon framework law, the responsibilities and authorities of the Ministry of oil and the INOC would be altered significantly.

Summary:
In Subtitle A, Congress established a two-pronged approach for protecting the privacy of nonpublic personal information obtained by financial institutions. A financial institution generally is prohibited from disclosing a consumer’s protected information to nonaffiliated third parties unless the institution provides the consumer with a privacy notice and an opportunity to opt out of such disclosures. The opt-out notice must, among other things, identify the categories of information that may be disclosed and the categories to whom disclosures may be made. As of March 1, 2002, 35 states and the District of Columbia have adopted statutes or regulations that are based on the 2000 Model Regulation. Of those 36 jurisdictions, 2—Vermont and New Mexico—substituted an opt-in requirement which can provide greater privacy protection. Four of the 14 Model Act states relaxed restrictions on disclosures for marketing purposes that are contained in the 1982 Model Act but are not imposed by Subtitle A or the 2000 models. The 2000 Model regulation treats health information differently from other nonpublic personal information. states generally is prohibited from disclosing nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties unless the provider first obtains the consumer’s affirmative authorization to do so. Vermont, however, limits the information that can be disclosed for joint marketing purposes. As of March 1, 2002, 14 states were relying on previously enacted laws that are based on the 1982 Model Act but had amended their laws or taken administrative measures to ensure compliance with Subtitle A's provisions. A number of the 14 Model Act states told us that they did not adopt the 2000. NAIC issued the Model Act in 1982 to address privacy concerns relating to the collection and disclosure of insurance information by insurance institutions, insurance agents, and organizations that assemble and provide information to insurers. The 1982 Model Act contains additional protections not provided by Subtitle A. A number of Model Act states modified some of the more protective provisions of their laws to obtain greater consistency with the less restrictive requirements of Sub Title A, the authors say. They say the states are in the process of adopting regulations, which would be based on the 2000 Model Regulation. Only one state, New York, has satisfied the Subtitle A mandate that state insurance authorities establish standards for safeguarding insurance customer records and information. The other states appear to have been waiting for NAIC to adopt the model regulation, “Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information” In early April, NAIC adopted the Model Safeguarded Regulation. FTC has received comments on proposed standards and is developing final rules. The Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodities Futures Trading Commission issued their rules to safeguard customer record information last year. NAIC wanted the report to reflect that since enactment of GLBA, the states have worked hard and accomplished a great deal to meet the congressionally mandated requirements of the law. NAIC emphasized that, nonetheless, to date, every state except Alaska has privacy protections in place that meet or exceed the standards established in GLBA.

NAIC provided greater details on the factors that affected the process it followed in drafting and adopting the Model Safeguarding Regulation. To determine the specific legislative and regulatory actions taken by the states to carry out the provisions of Subtitle A relating to the insurance industry, we used publicly available data from NAIC. We did not attempt to independently verify NAIC data. To obtain information on insurance privacy laws that are based on the 1982 Model Act, we sent a list of questions to the 14 state insurance authorities that continue to rely on such laws. and California’s draft regulations relating to the standards for safeguarding customer information. In addition, we interviewed two representatives of the NAIC Privacy Working Group, which developed the model standards. We performed our work between July 2001 and March 2002 in Washington, D.C., in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. As agreed with your office, unless you publicly release its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its date. We will also send copies of thisReport to the president of NAIC and to the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission and make copies available. to other interested parties upon request.

Summary:
The Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness) is responsible for developing the instruction for the conscientious objector application process. The Secretaries of the components, or their designees, are responsible for implementing the process and for making final decisions on whether to approve or deny applications. According to Coast Guard officials, the Coast Guard’s Director of Personnel Management is responsible. However, the Director of Human Resources makes the final decision on whetherto approve or disapprove conscientious Objector applications. conscientious objector status, servicemembers must submit clear and convincing evidence. A class 1-O applicant sincerely objects to all participation in any form of war and is discharged if the application is approved. With the exception of the Army and its reserve components, the components have the discretion to either reassign an approved class l-A-O conscientious objector to noncombatant duties or discharge them. These regulations do not recognize selective conscientious objection, that is, opposition to a specific war or conflict. Army regulation states that servicemembers approved for 1-A-O status are not eligible for discharge. The majority of these data are provided to DMDC by the military components. DMDC’s mission is to deliver timely and high-quality support to its customers and to ensure that the data it receives from different sources are consistent, accurate, and appropriate when used to respond to inquiries. The VA is responsible for providing a broad range of federal benefits and services to veterans and their families. assistance to veterans, their dependents, and their survivors. This organization administers disability compensation, pension, vocational rehabilitation and employment, education and training, home loan guaranty, and life insurance benefits. The National Cemetery Administration operates 125 national cemeteries in the United States and its territories. The Board of Veterans’ Appeals is a statutory board that makes decisions on appeals under the authority of the Secretary of VA. In 1993, we reported that between fiscal years 1988 and 1990, DOD processed up to 200 applications annually for conscientious objector status. About 80 to 85 percent of these applications were approved. the number of applications rose to 447, and about 61 percent were approved. Despite possible understatement, the numbers of known applications for conscientious objector status for calendar years 2002 through 2006 were relatively small compared to the size of the force. DMDC-provided data similarly shows a small number of separations, or discharges, for conscientious Objectors. All components of the Armed Forces follow the same basic steps to administer their conscientious Objector application processes. The application approval rate was 55 percent for the Army, 84 percent for. the Navy, 62 percent for Air Force, 33 percent for Marine Corps, and 33 percent. for the Coast Guard. objector process for each component said that the commanding officer reassigns the applicant. While temporarily assigned to noncombatant duties, an applicant must continue to meet the standards of acceptable conduct and performance of duties, such as wearing the uniform and following orders. Coast Guard officials said that in remote units in the active and reserve components where a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist is not readily available, processing is delayed. Navy and Marine Corps officials said they did not have visibility over this issue for either their active or reserve components. legal counsel, (2) given the opportunity to rebut the evidence in the record before the authorized official makes a final decision, and (3) given an explanation if the application is denied. According to their regulations, all components allow an applicant to obtain and pay for outside legal counsel. The time frame to submit a rebuttal varies among the components and ranges from 5 to 15 days. The applicant submits the rebuttal prior to the final processing of the application. On the basis of data provided by the components, the application can be approved. for calendar years 2002 through 2006, the military services took an average of about 7 months to process an application. The Air Force Reserve typically took the longest amount of time. According to component officials, processing may be prolonged when, for example, applications must be returned to the unit or the applicant for additional information. As stated earlier, Air National Guard and Coast Guard officials said that personnel who can conduct psychiatric or psychological evaluations are not always readily available and that this may prolong the processing time. Because they receive so few applications, it is necessary for officials located in the field offices to reeducate themselves about the applications. In general, servicemembers separated as conscientious objectors may be granted honorable or under honorable conditions (general) discharges, thereby making them eligible to receive the same benefits.

To determine how each component of the U.S. Armed Forces administers its process for approving or denying conscientious objector applications, we reviewed relevant guidance. When we found discrepancies (for example, duplicate Social Security numbers), we worked with the appropriate components and DMDC to understand the reasons for the discrepancies. We reviewed existing information about the systems that produced the data, and we interviewed component andDMDC officials to identify known problems or limitations in the data. We interviewed officials responsible for each component’s current practices for reviewing conscientious objector applications. We also interviewed VA, DOD, and component officials about the benefits available to conscientious objectors and other servicemembers upon discharge. We reviewed component-provided data to determine the characterization of discharge (e.g., honorable) received by the servicem embers separated as conscientious objecters. We used component- provided data to calculate the average processing time for conscientious objecter applications. and other benefits. 61 in 1994 (during a period when the services were larger) to 46 and 36 during calendar years 2005 and 2006.

Summary:
Since the 1960s, the U.S. has operated two separate operational polar-orbiting meteorological satellite systems. These satellites obtain environmental data that are processed to provide graphical weather images and specialized weather products. Polar satellites also provide data used to monitor environmental phenomena, such as ozone depletion and drought conditions. In the future, both NOAA and DOD plan to continue to launch additional POES and DMSP satellites to provide additional global coverage of conditions that affect the weather and climate. satellites. Each satellite makes about 14 orbits a day. As the earth rotates beneath it, each satellite views the entire earth’s surface twice. satellites every few years, with final launches scheduled for 2008 and 2010, respectively. Each of the polar satellites carries a suite of sensors designed to detect environmental data either reflected or emitted from the earth, the atmosphere, and space. The satellites store these data and then transmit the data to NOAA and Air Force ground stations when the satellites pass overhead. The ground stations then relay the data via communications satellites to the appropriate meteorological centers for processing. The processing centers also use the Internet to distribute data to the general public. When first received, satellite data are considered raw data. Processing centers format the data so that they are time-sequenced and include earth location and calibration information. These data records are then used to derive weather products called environmental data records (EDR) EDRs range from atmospheric products detailing cloud coverage, temperature, humidity, and ozone distribution; to land surface products showing snow cover, vegetation, and land use; to ocean products depicting sea surface temperatures, sea ice, and wave height. Numerical weather prediction models are used in producing hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly forecasts of atmospheric, land, and ocean conditions. Table 1 provides examples of models run by the processing centers. Figure 11 depicts the output of one common model. All this information is used in mapping and monitoring changes in weather, climate, the ocean, and the environment. These data and products are provided to weather forecasters for use in issuing weather forecasts and warnings to the public and to support our nation’s aviation, agriculture, and maritime communities. Within the military, these data and products allow military planners and tactical users to focus on anticipating and exploiting atmospheric and space environmental conditions. accurate wind and temperature forecasts are critical to any decision to launch an aircraft that will need mid-flight refueling. In addition to these operational uses of satellite data, there is also a substantial need for polar satellite data for research. Given the expectation that merging the POES and DMSP programs would reduce duplication and result in sizable cost savings, a May 1994 Presidential Directive was issued. Decision Directive required NOAA and DOD to converge the two satellite programs into a single satellite program. The converged program is called the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) NPOESS is considered critical to the United States’ ability to maintain the continuity of data required for weather forecasting and global climate monitoring. To manage this program, DOD, NOAA, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have formed a tri- agency Integrated Program Office. NPOESS is a major system acquisition estimated to cost almost $7 billion over the 24-year period from the inception of the program in 1995 through 2018. The program is to provide satellite development, satellite launch and operation, and integrated data processing. According to the Integrated Program Office, 8 of the 14 planned NPOESS instruments involve new technology development, whereas 6 others are based on existing technologies. The planned instruments and the state of technology on each are listed in table 2. The user community designated six of these data products—supported by four sensors—as key EDRs. the development and production contract was awarded to TRW in August 2002. At that time, TRW assumed system performance responsibility for the overall program. This responsibility includes all aspects of design, development, integration, assembly, test and evaluation, operations, and on-orbit support. Northrop Grumman Space Technology purchased TRW and became the prime contractor on the NPOESS project. In May 1997, the Integrated Program Office assessed the technical, schedule, and cost risks of key elements of the program. The program office determined that three elements had high risk components. were assessed as high risk in all three areas. The launch segment and the command, control, and communications segment were determined to present low or moderate risks. The program office expected to reduce its high risk components to low and moderate risks by the time the development and production contract was awarded, and to have all risk levels reduced to low before the first launch. Table 3 displays the results of the 1997 risk assessment as well as the program office’s estimated risk levels by August 2002 and by firstLaunch. the development of key sensor technologies in advance of the satellite system itself. Because environmental sensors have historically taken 8 years to develop, the program office began developing six of the eight sensors with more advanced technologies early. Another major risk reduction initiative expected to address risks in three of the four segments with identified risks is called the NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) NPP is a planned demonstration satellite to be launched in 2006, several years before the first N POESS satellite launch in 2009. The schedule for launching the satellites was driven by a requirement that the satellites be available to back up the final POES and DMSP satellites. In general, program officials anticipate that roughly 1 out of every 10 satellites will fail either during launch or during early operations after launch. Key program milestones included (1) launching NPP by May 2006 in order to allow time to learn from that risk reduction effort, and (2) having the first NPOESS satellite available to Back Up the Final POES satellite launch in March 2008. This shift will affect the NPOESS deployment schedule. Unless the existing operational satellite is able to continue operations beyond its expected lifespan, there could be a gap in satellite coverage. In the early 1990s, the development of the second generation of NOAA’s geostationary satellites experienced severe technical problems, cost overruns, and schedule delays, resulting in a 5-year schedule slip in the launch of the first satellite. In 2000, we reported that geostatedary satellite data coverage was again at risk because of a delay. The cost estimates for all four critical sensors have increased, due in part to including items that were not included in the original estimates. While all the sensors are still expected to be completed within schedule, many have slipped to the end of their schedule buffers. The timely development of three of these sensors (the visible/infrared imager, the infrared camera, and the X-ray camera) is expected to help reduce the cost of the project. The program office reduced some of the risks inherent in developing new technologies by initiating the development of these sensor early. radiometer suite, the cross-track infrared sounder, and the advanced technology microwave sounder. These sensors are to be demonstrated on the NPP satellite, currently scheduled for launch in October 2006. Officials anticipate that there could be cost increases and schedule delays associated with addressing performance issues. Any delay in that launch date could affect the overall NPOESS program because the success of the program depends on learning lessons in data processing and system integration from the N PP satellite. The interface data processing system is especially critical. a ground-based system that is to process the sensors’ data so that they are usable by the data processing centers and the broader community of environmental data users. The development of this system is critical for both NPP and NPOESS. When used with NPP, the system is expected to produce 26 of the 55 EDRs that NPOess will provide, processing approximately 93 percent of the planned volume of N POESS data. These activities will allow system users to work through any problems well in advance of when the N Poess data are needed. for operational use, but program officials noted that there is still uncertainty in how much time and effort it will take to complete this conversion. Any significant delays could cause the potential coverage gap between the final POES and first NPOESS satellites to grow even larger. Program officials are working to address the changes in funding levels and schedule, and to make plans for addressing specific sensor and data processing system risks. They acknowledge that delays in the program and efforts to address risks on key components could increase the overall cost of the program. budget for the NPOESS program. Officials noted that this rebaselining effort will involve a major contract renegotiation. Program officials reported that they hope to complete the new program baseline by August 2003. This new satellite system is considered critical to the United States’ ability to maintain the continuity of data required for weather forecasting and global climate monitoring through the year 2018. The first satellite was expected to be ready to act as a backup should the launch of the final satellites in the predecessor POES and DMSP programs fail. GAO: Our objectives were to provide an overview of our nation’s current polar- orbiting weather satellite program and the planned National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) program. GAO relied on prior GAO reviews of the satellite programs of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) We reviewed documents from NOAA, DOD, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that describe the purpose and origin of the polar satellite program. Integrated Program Office and NASA officials to determine the program’s background, status, and plans. To identify key risks to the successful and timely deployment of NPOESS, we assessed the NPOess acquisition status and program risk reduction efforts. We also reviewed documents and interviewed program office officials on plans to address N POESS challenges. NOAA, DOD, and NASA generally agreed with the facts as presented in this statement and provided some technical corrections, which we have incorporated.

Summary:
"Evergreening" involves obtaining multiple patents that cover different aspects of the same product. Critics of evergreening assert that the ability to obtain multiple patents on a product, over a period of many years, effectively extends the term of exclusivity that the patent holder obtains. Other observers believe that the term "ever greening" is perjorative and misdescribes long-standing intellectual property policy that allows innovators to obtain patents on improvement inventions. The U.S. Constitution confers upon Congress the power "To promote the Progress of ... useful Arts" An invention that constitutes a "process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter" may be patented. It must also be novel, or different, from subject matter disclosed by an earlier patent, publication, or other state-of-the-art knowledge. An invention is not patentable if "the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains" If the USPTO allows the patent to issue, its owner obtains the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing into the United States. use made of the invention by the infringer." The maximum term of patent protection is ordinarily set at 20 years from the date the application is filed. Patent owners who wish to compel others to respect their rights must commence enforcement proceedings in the federal courts. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) possesses nationwide jurisdiction over most patent appeals from the district courts.. The Supreme Court enjoys discretionary authority to review cases decided by the Federal. Circuit. According to Janice Mueller, a member of the faculty of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, and Donald Chisum, a retired member of the Santa Clara University Law School faculty, "evergreening refers to attempts by owners of pharmaceutical product patents to effectively extend the term of those patents on modified forms of the same drug" Various properties of a drug that are eligible for patenting include methods of manufacture, methods of medical treatment, chemical intermediates, formulations, mechanisms of action, packaging, delivery profiles, screening methods, and biological targets. A simple example illustrates how different patents may cover the same product. a brand-name drug company, Alpha Pharmaceutical Co., discovers that a new chemical compound is useful for treating a particular disease. Alpha files a patent application on that active ingredient on January 1, 2005. The USPTO approves the application, resulting in a patent that will expire 20 years later. Under this example, a generic drug company may begin selling products that employ the active ingredient starting in 2025. However, the generic firm may not use the improved manufacturing method at that time. It must instead use another manufacturing technology until 2030, when the second patent expires. evergreeening typically refers to the construction of a patent portfolio that covers a single product. It has also been used in connection with marketing strategies allegedly employed by brand-name pharmaceutical firms. Some observers believe that the practice of patent evergreening is promoted by the availability of "continuation applications" Continuation applications allow inventors to extend the period of examination at the USPTO in order to amend existing claims or submit new ones, authors say.. The patent statute allows inventors of any sort of technology to obtain patents upon improvements. Hatch-Waxman Act governs the procedures through which a potential generic drug manufacturer may obtain FDA marketing approval on a drug that has been patented by another. Some observers believe that the Act provided additional incentives to evergreen. Critics argue that evergreening conflicts with congressional judgment concerning the duration of patent rights. However, obtaining multiple patents that cover the same product may effectively extend the aggregate period of patent protection that applies to that product, the authors say. They say Congress has established a term that ordinarily extends for 20 years from the date of filing. Under the Patent Act, each invention must fulfill a number of requirements in order to be subject to patent protection. Among these criteria are that the invention must be novel, nonobvious, and fully disclosed in an application submitted to the USPTO. These statutory standards are applied neutrally to each kind of invention, whether it may be characterized as an "original" (such as a medication that has never been previously approved by the FDA) or an "improvement" ( such as a new formulation of a known medication) Some observers believe that, on an individual or collective basis, patents on more marginal improvements may provide the public with valuable sources of technological information. Some commentators also believe the critique that many "evergreen" patents represent trivial variations of earlier technologies is misplaced. They assert that many patented improvements provide significant practical benefits. For example, a new formulation may make a known medication easier to use, leading to greater patient compliance, or cause fewer side effects. While there are a rising number of patents for incremental technical advances, the collectivity of incremental advances provides essential information for further innovation. Patents on improvement inventions may not block competitors from marketing competing products that were covered by patents that have expired. The scope of protection provided by a particular patent varies in accordance with the degree of technological advance provided by the patented invention. In particular, a patent that claims a new active ingredient for use in a pharmaceutical typically provides more robust proprietary rights than improvement patents. The ability of any innovator to obtain a patent is said to encourage competition among different firms, both in innovation and in the marketplace. Some experts believe that recent changes to patent law rules may have limited evergreening strategies. From 1870 to 1995, the maximum term of a U.S. patent was 17 years from the date it issued. For patents based upon applications filed on or after June 8, 1995, maximum term is 20 years. Any patent that issues from a continuation application now expires at the same time as the original application—namely, 20 years after the filing date of the original patent. The incentives to "evergreen patents" illegitimately have been significantly curtailed by these developments as to the patent term. A 2007 U.S. Supreme Court opinion addresses one of the fundamental requirements for obtaining a patent. Many observers believe that the KSR opinion raised the standard of nonobviousness. If this view is accurate, evergreening may become a less viable tactic because patents to improvement inventions may be more difficult to procure from the USPTO. If Congress changes the patent term, this tactic may no longer be as viable, as some observers say. The patent term is set to expire at the end of 2015. Some observers believe that the broad ability to file continuation applications encourages evergreening practices. The USPTO recently promulgated controversial rules that would have limited the availability of continuation applications. No provision of the U.S. Patent Act is specifically directed towards ever greening issues. Recent amendments to the Patent Law of India were introduced arguably arguably to encourage ever green patenting in that country as well as in other nations such as Australia and New Zealand. In this respect, legislative developments in other countries might also be of interest. Section 3(d) of that statute provides: The following are not inventions within the meaning of this Act: [T]he mere discovery of a new form of a known substance which does not result in the enhancement of the known efficacy of that substance. For the purposes of this clause, salts, esters, ethers, polymorphs, metabolites, pure form, particle size, isomers, mixtures of isomers,. complexes, combinations and other derivatives of known substance shall be considered to be same substance. University of Pittsburgh, "[t]his express and detailed statutory presumption against patentability of derivatives ... reflects a strong resentment towards ever-greening of pharmaceutical patents" Some commentators have expressed concern that the Indian patent statute may violate obligations established by the World Trade Organization (WTO) Current bills before the 111 th Congress would potentially introduce a more generalized reform of the patent system. Persistent concerns have been voiced that certain patents upon improvement technologies are of poor quality and doubtful validity. Effective rules that would allow the USPTO to issue high-quality patents, may allay some of these concerns. broad range of reforms in an effort to improve the patent system. Janice Mueller and Donald Chisum assert that "[d]rawing the line between improper attempts at evergreening and legitimate incremental innovation is a broad and difficult problem in patent law" The difficulty of this discussion is suggested by the fact that numerous knowledgeable observers have reached strongly contrasting views concerning the propriety of improvement patenting, the extent of any possible negative social impact of this practice, and even the term "evergreening" itself.

Summary:
The United States imposes economic sanctions on North Korea for activities related to weapons proliferation. North Korea is identified by the United States as a "jurisdiction of money laundering concern" The Government of North Korea also is designated as a state sponsor of acts of international terrorism. The sanctions quashes most U.S. foreign aid, trade, investment, and support in international financial institutions, authors say. The United States also could be subject to economic sanctions provided in three provisions of law addressing human rights conditions, they say. Concerns about North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons capability emerged in the 1980s. Through the late 1990s, the United States and North Korea engaged in negotiations. In October 2002, it came to light in negotiations that North Korea was pursuing a uranium-based nuclear weapons. The Six Party Talks collapsed in late 2008, and the Agreed Framework has not been revived. The U.S. and N. Korea are still in talks, but they have taken several steps back.. North Korea has engaged in a number of acts that the international community deems provocative. David Rothkopf: U.N. Security Council condemned attack on South Korean ship in 2010. He says President Obama assigned responsibility to North Korea for the sinking of the Cheonan. Obama's explicit identification of all features of North Korea's objectionable behavior constituting the threat is unusual, he says. Rothkapf: Each of these forms of objectionable behavior likely would be grounds, under current law, for restricting trade, aid, arms sales, and so on in the U.S. U.S. economic sanctions imposed on North Korea have the following impact: Trade is limited to food, medicine, and other humanitarian-related goods, all of which require a license. Arms sales and arms transfers are fully denied. Financial transactions are prohibited. U.S.-based assets are blocked for North Korean individuals, entities, and vessels designated by the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) North Korea is ineligible to participate in any government program that makes credit, credit guarantees, or investment guarantees available. U.S. trade with North Korea is significantly restricted because of that country's demonstrated pursuit of nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them. The Department of Commerce has treated North Korea a s a state sponsor of international terrorism, even in the period that the North Korean government was removed from the terrorism list, from mid-2008 through most of 2017. The Office of Foreign Assets Control, within the Department of the Treasury, must approve any U.s. importation from North Korea, and weighs all requests in the context of proliferation, money laundering, counterfeiting and narcotics trafficking. in violation of U.S. missile nonproliferation laws. Once a finding is made, the imposition of sanctions is mandatory, though sanctions may be waived if the President finds it "essential to the national security of the United States" The severity of the sanction depends on the type of material or technology transferred. North Korea is also subject to the economic sanctions provided in three provisions of law addressing human rights conditions. The sanctions imposed pursuant to these acts would be largely redundant, however, with penalties already prescribed to North Korea. The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) is administered by the Department of State. The first ITAR was issued on August 26, 1955. North Korea has been listed as a restricted country from the ITAR's inception. The President has the authority to change these regulations by removing North Korea from the list of restricted countries. The U.N. Security Council, terrorism, and policies that include arms embargoes and sanctions are cited as reasons for restricting arms trade with North Korea. June 26, 2008, when the Six Party Talks appeared to be making progress, President Bush determined it was no longer in the national interest to continue certain restrictions imposed on trade and transactions with North Korea. At the same time, however, he found that … the current existence and risk of the proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat. U.S. persons may not register a vessel in North Korea, obtain authorization for a vessel to fly the North Korean flag, or own, lease, operate, or insure any vessel flagged by North Korea. All property and interests in property of North Korea or a North Korean national that were blocked as of June 16, 2000, and remained blocked immediately prior to the date of this order. Designees include Kim Jong-un; and Executive Order 13810 of March 15, 2016 (President Obama; 81 F.R. 14943) of September 20, 2017 (President Trump; 82 F.R. 44705)—blocking property and interests in property that come under U.S. jurisdiction of designated persons and entities that operate in the DPRK's "construction, energy, financial services, fishing, information technology, manufacturing, medical, mining, textiles, or transportation industries" The President has the authority to change regulations, as long as those changes meet the requirements of any relevant law. He must also annually revisit his declaration of a state of national emergency; it expires if the President does not renew it. 2005, President George W. Bush expanded the authority granted his office to address the threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The 41 st President had declared that the United States faced a national emergency relating to weapons proliferation in 1990. Fifteen years later, the 43 rd President's executive order took additional steps to block property and assets under U.S. jurisdiction of any person found, in part ... to have engaged, or attempted to engage, in the proliferation. of WMDs. in activities or transactions that have materially contributed to, or pose a risk of contributing to, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or their means of delivery. This includes any efforts to manufacture, acquire, possess, develop, transport, transfer or use such items, by any person or foreign country of proliferation concern. At its outset, Executive Order 13382 identified eight foreign entities as contributors to proliferation, of which three were North Korean. The Office of Foreign Assets Control subsequently added North Korean entities and individuals to this restricted list. North Korea may reap as much as $500 million annually from counterfeiting, and another $100 million to $200 million from narcotics trafficking. The finding and initial proposed rulemaking had a chilling effect on Banco Delta Asia's international business relations. Some two dozen financial institutions across the globe have voluntarily cut back or terminated their business with North Korea, notably including institutions in China, Japan, Vietnam, Mongolia, and Singapore. President Obama also addresses money laundering and counterfeiting as one of North Korea's many objectionable behaviors to be deterred. U.N. Security Council has sought to protect DPRK's civilian population from the consequences of economic sanctions. Congress defers the broadest power to the President, in the National Emergencies Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, to curtail trade and transactions between the United States and North Korea. Congress authorizes the President to fine-tune the relationship with North Korea for foreign policy and national security reasons with each authority it incorporates. At the same time, Congress closely influences the President's choices by enacting legislation—addressing human rights matters or proliferation-driven issues.

Summary:
We were unable to express an opinion on IRS’ financial statements for fiscal year 1994 for the following five primary reasons. The amount of total revenue of $1.3 trillion reported in the financial statements could not be verified or reconciled to accounting records maintained for individual taxpayers in the aggregate. IRS continued to be unable to reconcile its Fund Balance With Treasury accounts. We could not determine from our testing of IRS' gross and net accounts receivable estimates of over $69 billion and $35 billion, respectively, whether those estimates were reliable. could not substantiate a significant portion of IRS’ $2.1 billion in nonpayroll expenses included in its total operating expenses of $7.2 billion. IRS has made some progress in responding to the problems we identified in our previous audits. However, IRS needs to intensify its efforts in this area. IRS must develop a plan to deal with its $5.1 million in payroll expenses, the report says. It says IRS has fully implemented only 13 of our 59 recommendations. Inadequate internal controls, especially the lack of proper documentation of transactions, resulted in IRS continuing to report unsupported revenue information. In some cases, IRS did not maintain documentation to support reported balances. In other cases, it did not perform adequate analysis, such as reconciling taxpayer transactions to the general ledger, to ensure that reported information was reliable. We found several internal control problems that contributed to our inability to express an opinion on IRS’ financial statements. The sections below discuss these issues in greater detail.detailed plan with explicit, measurable goals and a set timetable for action. IRS has invested over $2.5 billion in TSM since 1986. It plans to spend an additional $695 million in fiscal year 1996 for this effort. Through 2001, it is expected to spend up to $8 billion on TSM. TSM is key to IRS’ vision of a virtually paper-free work environment where taxpayer account updates are rapid, and taxpayer information is readily available to IRS employees to respond to taxpayer inquiries.. IRS did not have a comprehensive business strategy to cost-effectively reduce paper submissions. IRS’ strategic information management practices were not fully in place to guide systems modernization. IRS had not established an effective organizational structure to consistently manage and control system modernization organizationwide. The accountability and responsibility for IRS’ systems development was spread among the Modernization Executive, Chief Information Officer, and research and development division. We made over a dozen specific recommendations to the IRS Commissioner in our report to enable the IRS to improve its software development capability in key process areas. The report was based on GAO/AIMD-94-115, May 1994, and our Strategic Information Management (SIM) Self-Assessment Toolkit. IRS to overcome its management and technical weaknesses by December 1995. The House Conference Report on IRS’ fiscal year 1996 appropriation notes that legislative language “fences” $100 million in TSM funding. As of March 4, 1996, the Secretary of the Treasury had not reported to the Committees on TSM. We are assessing IRS' actions and will provide a status report to the committees by March 14, 1996.

Summary:
Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 requires that federal contracts be awarded on the basis of full and open competition. We reviewed 14 new contracts that were awarded in fiscal year 2003. We found that the agencies responsible for rebuilding Iraq generally complied with applicable requirements when awarding new reconstruction contracts. For 13 of these new contracts, agency officials adequately justified their decisions and complied with the statutory and regulatory competition requirements, we found. We also found the Army Corps of Engineers properly justified the award of a sole-source contract to restore Iraq’s oil infrastructure. Of 11 task orders we reviewed, 7 were, in whole or part, not within scope. Defense Contracting Command-Washington improperly used a General Services Administration schedule contract. Army Field Support Command’s $1.9 million task order for contingency planning for the Iraqi oil infrastructure mission was outside the scope of the contract. DOD planners believed early on that Kellogg Brown & Root would be uniquely qualified to execute the plan for restoring Iraq’S oil infrastructure should Iraqi forces damage or destroy it. with the recommendations and noted that it was in the process of taking corrective actions. DOD also agreed with our recommendation that the Secretary of Defense evaluate the lessons learned in Iraq and develop a strategy for assuring that adequate acquisition staff and other resources can be made available in a timely manner. I will now turn to discussing our ongoing work on DOD’s use of global logistics support contracts. In total, the estimated value of the work under the current contracts is $12 billion, including $5.6 billion for work in Iraq through May 2004. overall observation about the vital services that these types of contracts provide. The contractors and the military services have, for the most part, worked together to meet military commanders’ needs, sometimes in very hazardous or difficult circumstances. For example, the LOGCAP contract is providing life and logistics support to more than 165,000 soldiers and civilians under difficult security circumstances in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, and Djibouti. The AFCAP contractor is providing air traffic management at air bases throughout central Asia. Some customers planned well for the use of the contracts, including the contractor early in planning. The use of LOGCAP in Kuwait and Iraq was not adequately planned, the report found. Task orders were frequently revised, generating a significant amount of rework for the contractor and the contracting officers. The report will make a number of recommendations to address the shortcomings we identified in these areas. this report will be published later this year on the Defense Department's Web site at http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/features/2014/01/29/defense-contracting-report.html. work begins, we also found that many LOGCAP task orders remain undefinitized for months, and sometimes more than a year, after they were due to be completed. Because task orders have not been definitized, LOGCAP contracting personnel have not conducted an award fee board. I would like to note, however, that this condition is not limited to the LOGCAP contract. We stated in our report released yesterday that the Army Corps of Engineers has yet to definitize its March 2003 contract to rebuild Iraq’s oil infrastructure. U.S. Army, Europe, reported savings of approximately $200 million under the BSC. In others, however, most notably the LOGCAP contract in Iraq and Kuwait, we saw very little concern for cost considerations. It was not until December 2003, for example, that the Army instructed commands to look for ways to economize on the use of this contract. In addition to these savings, the Army routinely sends in teams of auditors from its internal review group to review practices and to make recommendations. the Air Force did not always select the most economical and efficient method to obtain services. It used the AFCAP contract to supply commodities for its heavy construction squadrons. Use of the contract to procure and deliver commodity supplies required that the Air Force pay the contractor’s costs plus an additional award fee. Air Force officials said that they used AFCAP because not enough contracting and finance personnel were deployed to buy materials quickly or in large quantities. We found that shortages of personnel have also made contract oversight difficult. southwest and central Asia and the Balkans to provide on-site contract administration. Administrative contracting officers in Iraq, for example, have been overwhelmed with their duties. Some Army and Air Force personnel with oversight responsibilities did not receive the training necessary to effectively accomplish their jobs. Military units receiving services from the contracts generally lacked a comprehensive understanding of their contract roles and responsibilities, the report found. The U.S., along with its coalition partners and various international organizations and donors, has undertaken an enormously complex, costly, and difficult project. Some agency officials overstepped the latitude provided by competition laws, authors say. They say the work should have been separately competed, or justified and approved for performance by the existing contractor. Importantly, given the war in Iraq, the urgent need for reconstruction efforts, and the unstable security environment, these actions were necessary, they say. The authors say the U.S. needs to be careful in the future to avoid a repeat of the mistakes made in the past, and to ensure the future of Iraq is secure. latitude allowed by the competition law, these task orders reasonably could have been supported by justifications for other than full and open competition. Logistics support contracts have developed into a useful tool for the military services to quickly obtain needed support for troops deployed to trouble spots around the world. Because of the nature of these contracts, however, they require significant government oversight to make sure they are meeting needs in the most economic and efficient way possible in each circumstance. The military services are learning how to use these contracts well, but in many cases the services are not achieving the most cost-effective performance. of the committee, this concludes my statement.

Summary:
As of February 1, 2015, there was one preventive medicine unit available to conduct OEHS activities in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. Each of the military services has a public health surveillance center that provides support and technical guidance on reporting on potential environmental risks to combatant commands and their subordinate commands. Health surveillance during deployments includes identifying the deployed population at risk, recognizing and assessing potentially hazardous health exposures and conditions, employing specific preventive countermeasures, daily monitoring of real-time health outcomes, and reporting of disease and injury. DOD collects and stores three types of data during deployments: (1) daily individual servicemember location data, (2) medical data, and (3) OEHS data. Once collected, DOD currently uses two separate IT systems for the storage of OE HS data. MESL contains both classified and unclassified documents that have been scanned and uploaded into the system. DOEHRS is a database that incorporates additional functionalities including OEhs data collection, management, and assessment. DOD is transitioning from the use of MESL to DOEHRS, which has greater functionality. However, DOD’s current policy does not reflect the potential transition. Inconsistencies between DOD and military service-specific policies regarding OEHS data storage have led to fragmentation and duplication of OEhs data. VBA processes veterans’ claims for monthly compensation for service-connected disabilities. VHA also conducts or sponsors research on veterans' illnesses related to military occupational and environmental exposures. The military services lack specific and consistent guidance on performing quality assurance reviews. As a result, it is difficult to identify complete and comprehensive data sets for specific types of OEHS data. This may lead to problems when officials attempt to use these data in the future. A U.S. Army Public Health Command official who has technical expertise in both systems confirmed that there is duplication of O EHS data storage, but said it is not possible to determine the extent of the duplication because only DOEHRS has specific data level querying capabilities. The military services use site assessments to identify and address potential occupational and environmental health risks at deployment locations. DOD established the Occupational and Environmental Health Site Assessment (OEHSA) in 2007. In our review of 50 OEHSAs for sites in Iraq or Afghanistan, we found that almost all contained recommendations for mitigating potential health risks for servicemembers in these locations. For example, a 2011 OEHSA for a site in Afghanistan found that particulate matter concentrations exceeded military guidelines, and consequently, air quality was at moderate risk. OEHSAs identify recommended countermeasures to mitigate some potential occupational and environmental health risks. The extent to which these recommendations are being implemented is unclear due to a lack of documentation and monitoring. Despite the ongoing collection of OEHS data, both DOD and VA have used OEhs data to a limited extent to address post-deployment health conditions. For example, service component commands have begun holding and documenting monthly meetings with the CENTCOM official responsible for OEHLs to further monitor activities. DOD officials have been conducting research on the use of dosimeters. Current technology allows for a dosimeter to be used for a single known hazard. In deployed settings, servicemembers may be exposed to multiple hazards and unknown exposures. During deployments, these factors are often unknown; therefore it is difficult to determine the type of dosimeter that should be used. Additionally, it may be difficult to evaluate or treat some service members who have been exposed to occupational or environmental hazards in the field. DOD creates Periodic Occupational and Environmental Monitoring Summaries (POEMS) POEMS are made available to medical providers to help inform diagnosis and treatment of servicemembers. In September 2014, DOD implemented a new review process for the completion of POEMS. As of March 2015, 23 of the approximately 40 POEMS from Iraq and Afghanistan have been made available. VBA officials told us that they have access to unclassified POEMS through a MESL website.. VA also uses OEHS data to supplement information used to educate veterans on specific deployment issues. VA’s Office of Public Health officials told us they develop the content of the website through environmental hazard information obtained from several sources, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. For example, the website includes detailed information about Gulf War veterans’ unexplained illnesses, including available benefits and links to relevant research. The Millennium Cohort Study is the largest prospective study designed to assess the long-term health effects of military service both during and after deployment. As part of this study, DOD and VA conducted another study. that found that a servicemember located within 3 miles of a documented burn pit was not significantly associated with increased risk for respiratory symptoms or conditions. Neither study was able to identify a causal link between exposures to burn pits and respiratory conditions. The Institute of Medicine was unable to determine whether certain long-term health effects are likely to result from exposure toBurn Pits during deployments because the studies it reviewed lacked the support to conclude the absence or existence of an association. deployment to Iraq and Kuwait and the development of respiratory conditions post-deployment. Since 2003, DOD and VA have collaborated through the DHWG on deployment health issues related to occupational and environmental hazards. Problems with storage and quality assurance for OEHS data compromise the departments’ ability to use them in determining service-connections for specific health conditions, the authors say. The authors recommend that the Secretary of Defense determine which types of unclassified OE HS data should be used to prevent fragmentation and duplication in the storage of un classified OEhs data. They also recommend that DOD clarify the department’s policy on the storage and use of the unclassified data. service policies that are linked to the main DOD Instruction are inconsistent in identifying which system to use for storing OEHS data. DOD noted that the implementation of such a process would be complex, in that it would need to include definitions of completeness and reasonableness. While we appreciate DOD’s comments, an appropriate level of quality assurance needs to be performed to ensure the reliability of the OE HS data being collected. Otherwise, these data will not be useful for the intended purposes. committees and the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs.

Summary:
NextGen and SESAR envision an airspace system in which network-based information and automation optimize an aircraft’s operation in all phases of flight. Prescripted e-mail-like messages would replace routine voice communications between air traffic controllers and pilots. Navigation procedures used will be based on the performance capabilities of the aircraft. Each airplane will transmit and receive precise information about its position and the position of other nearby aircraft, as well as the time at which it and others will cross key points along their paths. ADS-B uses satellite signals along with aircraft avionics to transmit the aircraft’s location to ground receivers. ADS-B incorporates an aircraft-mounted transmitter and receiving units on the ground, about the size of a minirefrigerator. It can be placed nearly anywhere, such as on cell phone towers or on oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, where radar coverage does not reach.to retire, over time, up to 50 percent of secondary radar and reduce associated maintenance costs. FAA has the primary responsibility for developing, and managing the transition to, and implementing NextGen. The EU has divided SESAR into three phases, but in contrast to FAA’s government-centric approach to NextGen, it has provided a participatory role for the private sector. The differences in characteristics between the United States and the EU contribute to differences in how they manage their respective modernization programs, the authors say. They say FAA is focusing on making the most of technologies and procedures that are already available. FAA and SJU officials highlighted the Atlantic Interoperability Initiative to Reduce Emissions as an example of international collaboration. In 2007, the European Commission and FAA began collaborating to demonstrate how using NextGen/SESAR air traffic management techniques can lead to emissions and fuel savings. Tests at Honolulu and Anchorage International Airports showed that use of Optimal Profile Descent could save a total exceeding 8 million gallons of fuel and 167 million pounds of COplan, FAA and EUROCONTROL said. FAA and the European Commission signed a new MOC in March 2011. The MOC provides more specific direction on collaboration and governance as NextGen and SESAR move forward. The 2011 MOC establishes the main principles of cooperation and governance for NextGen. It also establishes a Joint Committee that is responsible for the MOC’s effective functioning and for evaluating its implementation. The list of research topics was developed during meetings among FAA, EUROCONTROL, SJU and the EU. FAA and SJU are working with ICAO to facilitate interoperability with other countries beyond the United States and the EU. These standards will allow equipment manufacturers to offer solutions that meet both NextGen and SESAR requirements, increasing the size of their markets and driving down costs. FAA officials in the ATO’s International Office, as well as those responsible for NextGen planning and integration, told us that many other countries do not have the resources to develop their own systems or procedures. between NextGen and SESAR, as the United States and EU have worked together to feed the block upgrade process. The tight deadlines imposed by this initiative provided the impetus for continued U.S.-EU interaction in the working groups, on an informal basis, before the formal collaborative procedures were established by the 2011 MOC. Effective collaboration increases the likelihood that organizations can communicate substantive information, reach joint agreements, and implement those agreements. Organizations can use their strategic and annual performance plans as tools to drive collaboration. establishing mutually reinforcing or joint strategies to achieve the outcome. establishing compatible policies, procedures, and other means to operate across agency boundaries. agreeing upon respective roles and responsibilities. identifying and addressing needs by leveraging resources. developing mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and report the results of collaborative efforts. reinforcing individual accountability for collaborative efforts through agency performance management systems. and reinforcing agency accountability through agency plans and reports. The 2011 MOC defines the terms and conditions for mutual cooperation and sets forth the procedures by which FAA and SJU can establish cooperative research and development activities. FAA and SJU have assigned priorities such as “immediate” or “on hold,’ to these coordination plans. Those areas that do not have an immediate need for harmonization are deferred in favor of those with a more urgent need, such as data communications. SJU would like to see Data Comm implemented by 2018, while a senior FAA official believes it will take until 2023 at the earliest. FAA’s plans called for implementing an interim communications system as a step toward this future system. FAA and SJU have defined their roles and responsibilities for NextGen and SESAR collaboration, including how the collaborative effort will be led. FAA officials noted that U.S. and EU experts have prior experience leveraging each other’s research. FAA hopes to reduce the resources that each organization would otherwise require if it were to develop a solution in isolation. The 2011 MOC lays out a structure of jointly led and staffed coordination plans through which each side can leverage the resources of the other. The joint RTCA/EUROCAE special committees leverage the knowledge of officials representing NextGen, SESAR, and industry interests. For instance, representatives from FAA and EUROCONTROL, avionics manufacturers, U.S. Department of Transportation, and organized labor participate in the joint committee on Data Comm. Companies that traditionally compete for sales, such as Boeing and Airbus, or Raytheon and Thales (avionics manufacturers), work together in these joint committees. develop standards for air traffic management systems. These U.S. and EU companies want to operate in each other’s markets. They believe that they can save resources if the standards are harmonized. FAA and EUROCONTROL have a Coordination Committee under the MOC to oversee the FAA/EUROCON TROL action plans. The 2006 MOU called for FAA and the European Commission to try to meet at least every 12 months to review the functioning of the MOU. FAA has a long history of collaboration with the EU, but it has not detailed these efforts or outcomes in these publications. FAA’s strategic plan for 2009 through 2013, known as the Flight Plan, lacks any detailed information on these efforts. Stakeholders representing U.S. airlines, the aviation industry, and European avionics manufacturers told us that they were aware that work was progressing to ensure the interoperability of systems. But they were not aware of specific details of the MOC. Some stakeholders expressed skepticism about whether or when the future benefits of NextGen and SESAR will be realized. FAA and SJU have been wrestling with airlines’ hesitancy to equip with NextGen/SESAR technologies. Some of the key benefits, such as increased efficiency, are not realized when landings are delayed at congested airports. Airline confidence that there will be Next Gen/SesAR benefits over the long term is an important element in NextGen-SESar implementation. capacity and more direct, fuel-saving routing will not be realized until a critical mass of equipped aircraft exists. Because the first airlines to equip with the new technologies will not realize immediate benefits, it is difficult for an airline to make a business case showing that the near-term benefits of equipping will outweigh the cost. Efforts to reduce the federal debt could decrease the funding available to FAA for both collaboration and NextGen system development, potentially slowing the schedule for harmonization and adding to stakeholders’ skepticism. Cuts in system development budgets could also delay the schedule for harmonization and the realization of interoperability benefits. FAA officials told us that they normally absorb funding cuts by eliminating or delaying programs. A delay in implementing GBAS would require FAA to continue using the legacy Instrument Landing System, which does not provide the benefits of GBAS. The FAA may have to stop its work on GBAS while SESAR continues its GBAS development, with the result that SESar may have an operational GBAS, while FAA does not. that GBAS would provide, according to these officials. Such a situation could further fuel stakeholder skepticism about whether FAA will follow through with its commitment to implementing NextGen. FAA did not report on the impact of cuts on air traffic control modernization, including both the delayed benefits and the increased costs of maintaining legacy systems longer than originally planned. We recommended that FAA provide information about the ramifications of budget proposals to help congressional decision makers anticipate the effects of their decisions and to manage stakeholders’ expectations. annually report this information to Congress, as well as the potential effects of any budget or schedule slippages on the overall transition to NextGen. FAA established a new appendix to its Capital Investment Plan, which FAA provides annually to Congress and to the public over the Internet. The appendix includes each acquisition’s original and current budget and schedule, as we recommended. While the 2011 MOC follows several of the key practices that we have found can help to enhance and sustain collaborative efforts, it is still in the early stages of implementation. GAO: FAA and Europe jointly developed systems that were either not implemented or were implemented differently by each side. GAO: The absence of effective collaborative practices does not guarantee failure, nor does their presence ensure success. The real test of the MOC’s effectiveness will come when NextGen and SESAR move toward final decisions about implementing solutions and system components, the report says. The report will be available at no charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov. We also obtained perspectives from high-level U.S. and European stakeholder associations representing airlines, airports, as well as airframe and equipment manufacturers. In Washington, D.C., we visited the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA), to meet with officials from AIA’s Civil Aviation Infrastructure, International Affairs, and Standardization Offices. At Honeywell, we met with an official with Aerospace Regulatory Affairs. At the Air Transport Association, we meeting with officials within Legislative and Regulatory Policy, Airspace Management, and Operations. We conducted this performance audit from January to November 2011 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We conducted a search utilizing multiple databases, such as ProQuest, Academic OneFile, and EconLit, using search terms such as collaboration, cooperation, coordination combined with the terms interagency, successful, and effective. After reviewing citations for relevance and eliminating duplicates, we were left with 37 citations. Based on the review of these articles, we identified effective practices for collaboration and compared these practices with those from our prior work. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Summary:
least 70 countries. In addition, IRS pointed to certain current QI requirements that provide IRS with some information on fraud and illegal acts. IRS agreed that while there are benefits to electronic filing of tax Forms 1042 and 1042-S, IRS said there are also benefits to not filing forms at all. However, self-reporting by the QI is not equivalent to judgments by the auditors about whether there are indications that fraud or illegal acts have occurred. And the universe of potential fraud orillegal acts extends beyond potential violations of know your customer rules. such a requirement would be a burden for QIs that file only a few (3 or fewer) forms. Requiring electronic filing whenever possible would reduce IRS’s costs and improve the timeliness and accuracy of data for program oversight. Money is mobile and once it has moved offshore, the U.S. government generally does not have the authority to require foreign governments or foreign financial institutions to help IRS collect tax on income generated in the United States. The IRS said it has implemented a procedure to include an application to electronically file for all QIs applying for or renewing participation in the program. In 1913, the United States enacted its first legislation establishing that U.S. persons and NRAs were subject to withholding at source. IRS issued a comprehensive set of withholding regulations for NRAs in 1956. Payors of this income do not have to withhold tax on this income but are required to report certain information to IRS about the amounts of income sent and to whom. Among the types of investment income sent to NRAs, some are exempt from U.s. tax and some are taxable. financial intermediaries are neither required to withhold taxes on the income nor report information on the payment of the income to IRS. Some U.S. investment income, such as dividends, is subject to a statutory tax rate of 30 percent. Payors of this income generally are to withhold the 30 percent tax if the recipients do not reside in a nation that has negotiated a treaty with a lower tax rate. The payors also have to report to IRS certain information covering the amount of income sent and to whom. About $5 billion of this capital income was withheld for tax year 2003. Under the QI program, foreign financial institutions sign a contract with IRS to withhold and report U.S. source income sent offshore. QIs may opt out of primary withholding and reporting responsibilities for designated accounts. U.s. taxpayers must report all of their current income on their income tax returns. Most of the income flowing offshore is likely to be sent to NRAs, but some income may be sent directly to US. NRAs are taxed on their worldwide income, while US persons are only taxed on certain source income. Under the contract signed with IRS, QIs accept enhanced responsibilities for providing assurance that customers are in fact eligible for treaty benefits and exemptions. U.S. withholding agents must determine the residency of the owner of the income and the kind and amount of U.s. source income. Because QIs agree to follow specified account-opening procedures, there is enhanced assurance that the residency and nationality of the account holder has been accurately determined and thus correct withholding decisions will be made. NQIs provide somewhat less assurance of proper withholding and reporting than exists under the QI program. U.S. maintains a network of bilateral tax treaties designed to set out clear tax rules. Treaties are intended to eliminate double taxation of taxpayers conducting economic activity in the two jurisdictions. As of January 2007, there were 54 tax treaties in force, including all members of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) For tax year 2003, about 80 percent of U.S source income flowed through treaty countries, with 88 percent of that flowing through U.s. withholding agents. law, corporations, including foreign corporations, are treated as the taxpayers. Because the owners of the corporation are not known to IRS, individuals are able to hide behind the corporate structure. Withholding agents, regardless of the type of institution, generally may accept a withholding certificate at face value. In situations where the foreign corporation is owned by a U.S. person or persons, it is incumbent upon the owners to report their corporate ownership and any income appropriately taxable to them on their own tax returns. Mogul for income tax evasion. U.S. person, a resident of Nevada, produced, marketed, sold and distributed videotapes and DVDs through a business incorporated in Oklahoma and operating in California. He also formed a Nevada company to perform marketing, purchasing, and promotional activities on behalf of the Oklahoma/California company. Using nominee shareholders to conceal his ownership, he also established an international business corporation in the Cayman Islands which was the named owner of a bank account in Bermuda and a brokerage account in California, the indictment alleges. and brokerage accounts to obscure his ownership, overstate business and personal expenses, and underreport more than $18 million of his true taxable income for the years 2002-2003. Foreign corporations received at least $200 billion, or 68.4 percent, of the $293.3 billion in total U.S. source income for tax year 2003. From this income, almost $3 billion was withheld (a withholding rate of 1. 4 percent), representing more than$57 billion of treaty benefits and exemptions. IRS generally does not have the legal authority to audit a foreign financial intermediary. Internal auditors are not responsible for following up on possible indications of fraud or illegal acts. IRS obtains considerable data from withholding agents but does not make effective use of these data to ensure that withholding agents perform their duties properly, the authors say. The QI agreement requires each QI to engage and pay for an external auditor to perform “agreed-upon procedures” and submit a report of factual findings to IRS. U.S. Government Auditing Standards are more stringent on this topic than the ISRS standards. IRS could draw on existing auditing standards to establish a consistent definition of fraud and illegal acts. Data that IRS needs to effectively administer the QI program are not readily available for use and in some instances no longer exist. All withholding agents, whether QIs or not, are to report withholding information on their annual withholding tax returns (Forms 1042) and information returns ( form 1042-S) IRS has difficulty ensuring that refunds claimed by withholding agents are accurate. contracts whenever possible, thereby reducing the need to manually process data reported from abroad. IRS agreed it would be beneficial to investigate U.S. withholding agents’ reliance on self-certified identity documents. For the first recommendation, IRS’s detailed comments focused on examining the accuracy of the self- Certified documents. IRS agrees that there are benefits to electronic filing of tax Forms 1042 and 1042-S, but said such a requirement would be a requirement. of fraud and illegal acts. burden for QIs that file only a few (3 or fewer) forms. IRS said it has implemented a procedure to include an application to electronically file for all QIs applying for or renewing participation in the program. We believe any burdens filers of few forms would face could be addressed by offering them a waiver opportunity similar to waivers that are available to all institutions that are currently required to file electronically. Requiring electronic filing whenever possible would reduce IRS’s costs and improve the timeliness and accuracy of data for program oversight. from the issue date. At that time, we will send copies of this report to appropriate congressional committees and the Acting Commissioner of Internal Revenue. We also will make copies available to others upon request.

To address our objectives, we reviewed various IRS documents and interviewed IRS officials in the QI program office and U.S. withholding program audit staff. We reviewed various studies and reports on foreign investment and banking practices and visited IRS’’ Philadelphia Campus, which was responsible during our review for processing information returns submitted by some QIs. Withholding data used in this report were reported by the IRS. We analyzed IRS data on U.S. source income that flowed overseas for tax years 2002 and 2003. The data do not include an unknown amount of activity that was unreported. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of describing the QI program by (1) performing electronic testing for obvious errors in accuracy and completeness and (2) interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about the data. We reviewed the sampling methodology used in the AUPs and found that it was adequate to identify problems with the accounts. Joan Vogel; and Elwood White made key contributions to this report.

Summary:
Coal combustion residuals (CCRs) are the inorganic material that remains after pulverized coal is burned. EPA proposed for public comment two regulatory options applicable to the material. The Subtitle C option would create federal standards enforceable by EPA, but likely adopted and implemented by individual states. Another legislative option would amend Subtitle D of RCRA by adding Section 4011, Management and Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals. and create a permit program for CCR management. The proposed Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act is being debated in the conference over the transportation reauthorization legislation. Unique to the proposal would be the creation of a permit program in federal statute, absent the promulgation of related federally enforceable standards. Requirements applicable to the program's adoption and implementation would be those created within the amendment to RCRA. It would not authorize the agency with jurisdiction over RCRA's implementation (EPA) to promulgate regulations detailing permit program requirements or regulations applicable to facilities. requirements applicable to the proposed statutory CCR permit program would draw upon selected existing regulations. The report distinguishes between EPA and state agency authorities in regulating nonhazardous solid wastes under Subtitle D. In 2010, 45% of the electricity generated in the United States used coal as its source of fuel. Pulverized coal burned for electricity production generates a tremendous amount of residual inorganic material. in 2010, industry generated more than $1 billion in revenue from the sale of coal-based electricity. As much as 130 million tons of coal fly ash were generated in the United States. Disposal of CCRs on-site at individual power plants may involve decades-long accumulation of waste. In 2008, a breach in a surface impoundment pond at the Tennessee Valley Authority's (TVA's) Kingston, TN, plant released 1.1 billion gallons ofcoal fly ash slurry, covering more than 300 acres. TVA estimates that cleanup will continue into 2014 and will cost $1.2 billion. The Kingston release also brought attention to the fact that the management of CCRs is essentially unregulated at the federal level. The chemical composition of C CRs generated at a given plant depends on the type and source of the coal burned, as well as the combustion technology and air pollution control technology used at the plant. In data maintained by EPA, the agency has identified more than 40 toxic constituents that may be present in CCRS, including antimony, arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury and selenium. Toxic constituents are present in a waste does not in itself mean that it poses a risk to humans or the environment. The degree to which there is actual risk depends on whether those constituents can find a pathway of human exposure and whether the resulting level of exposure is likely to be high enough to cause harm. Human exposure to contaminants has been demonstrated through the direct discharge or release of liquid waste to surface water. The most common pathway of exposure has occurred through contaminant leaching when the waste was deposited in an unlined landfill or surface impoundment. In March 2000, EPA submitted a draft "Regulatory Determination on Wastes from Fossil Fuel Combustion" In it, EPA stated that CCRs warranted regulation as a hazardous waste under Subtitle C of RCRA. In the wake of events at Kingston, after 10 years of additional study, debate, and controversy, EPA did propose to revise its May 2000 determination. On October 16, 2009, EPA again submitted a proposed regulatory determination to list the material as hazardous waste. In its draft regulatory determination, EPA recognized that its March 2000 proposal was a departure from its previous opinions. high risk of human exposure to carcinogens, such as lead, selenium, and arsenic. The risk assessment showed that CCRs can be managed safely with the use of composite liners. EPA updated its list of damages to include 27 cases of proven damages to surface and groundwater and 40 cases of potential damage associated with the improper management of C CRs. In addition to impacts on human health, EPA's damage cases document adverse effects to plants and wildlife. The threat of a catastrophic release. similar, smaller incident in 2005 in Martins Creek, PA, were considered evidence that current management practices can pose additional risks. EPA determined that 75% of surface impoundments in use today are more than 25 years old. Such units are unlikely to have a liner or groundwater monitoring, and are more likely to leach contaminants. EPA estimated that with an average life expectancy of approximately 31 years, those older disposal facilities would likely continue to operate without necessary protections in place well into the future. EPA's Subtitle D approach to regulating CCR disposal facilities is generally supported by state regulatory agencies and industry groups. EPA would have no direct enforcement authority to ensure facility compliance or to require states to adopt a permit program. Instead, the standards could be enforced by states or citizens, pursuant to RCRA citizen suit authority. The proposed CCR permit program would draw from certain waste management standards promulgated or proposed by EPA pursuant to Sub Title D. It is useful to understand the requirements from which the proposal would be drawn to understand which states would have the primary authority to implement and enforce the proposal. criteria would be those necessary to ensure that ''no reasonable probability of adverse effects on health or the environment'' will result from disposal facilities or practices. The standards would apply to owners and operators of CCR landfills and surface impoundments. If implemented, CCR facilities that fail to satisfy the Subtitle D standards would be operating in violation of RCRA's prohibition of open dumping. EPA would have no authority to require states to adopt and apply them to CCR disposal facilities. Proposed amendment to RCRA would add a Section 4011, Management and Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals. Under that section, a permit program for the management and disposal of CCRs would be created. States would have the option of adopting a CCR permit program, and EPA would be required to implement the program in states that decline to do so. EPA has stated that, if enacted, all states with coal-fired power plants would likely choose to adopt the CCR program. The proposed amendment to RCRA would create a state-based permit program. It would use the MSW landfill requirements as its basis, but does not direct EPA to develop standards. Congress may give EPA express authority to both promulgate certain standards and enforce them. It is unclear whether a CCR permit program implemented under the proposed Section 4011 would result in a state applying regulatory standards to CCR landfills or surface impoundments that would differ appreciably from those it currently applies. First and second columns in Table A -1 list existing regulatory criteria applicable to MSW landfills. The third column lists CCR Permit Program Specifications included under the "Minimum Requirements" and "Revised Criteria" that would apply to the permit program in the proposed Section 4011 of RCRA. It is unclear whether or to what degree a state's CCR permit program would be comparable to an approved MSW permit program (as defined under current law) If a state did choose to apply those criteria to owners and operators of CCR structures, implementation would still likely be significantly different. As a result, the identification of comparable provisions that are not included among the requirements applicable to the permit program proposed in statute would likely not apply to a state's program or may be applied at its discretion. The identification of similar provisions is a way to determine whether a state has a permit program that is similar to the one proposed in the statute. The state's permit program may be similar to that proposed by the federal government, but not the same as the state's permitting program, the law says. The law could be applied in a variety of ways.

Summary:
Under the Defense Environmental Restoration Program, DOD is authorized to identify, investigate, and clean up environmental contamination and other hazards at FUDS. To be eligible for cleanup, a property must have been owned by, leased to, possessed by, or otherwise controlled by DOD during the activities that caused hazards. These hazards consist of unsafe buildings, structures, or debris, such as leaning or weakened. Under the environmental restoration program, DOD’s activities addressing hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants are required to be carried out consistent with section 120 of CERCLA. load-bearing walls or supports; open-sided platforms or floors more than 6 feet above the next lower level; and any pit, depression, or tank that can collect or contain standing water. According to DOD’s fiscal year 2001 report on the status of its various environmental cleanup programs, there were 9,181 properties identified by the Corps, the states, or other parties as potentially eligible for cleanup. Figure 1 shows examples of the types of hazards that might be found at FUDS properties. The Corps conducts a preliminary assessment of eligibility to establish whether the property was ever owned or controlled by DOD. At the end of the preliminary assessment, the Corps determines if any further study or cleanup action is needed. The Corps does not consult with EPA or the states when making its determination. Based on our review of NDAI files, we estimate that the Corps doesn't have a sound basis for about 38 percent or 1,468, of the estimated 3,840 determinations in our study population. information that would have allowed it to identify all of the potential hazards at the properties or that it took sufficient steps to assess their presence. In many cases, when attempting to identify potential hazards resulting from DOD activities, the Corps apparently did not obtain relevant information about former DOD activities and facilities. In a number of cases, it appeared that the Corps overlooked or dismissed information in its possession when it looked for evidence of potential hazards. The problems we noted occurred, in part, because Corps guidance is not specific about what documents the Corps should obtain. 15,000-gallon underground storage tanks, an area adjacent to a drinking water source that is “highly” contaminated with oil by-products are hazards. A concrete structure (15 feet wide, 70 feet long, and 60 feet deep) filled with water presents a drowning hazard. These hazards have all been determined to result from DOD use of the property and are eligible for cleanup under the FUDS program. Information on potential hazards found at certain types of FU DS properties may also be useful in identifying potential hazards at other similar properties. We found that at times Corps officials overlooked or dismissed information in their possession that indicated potential hazards might be present. In other cases, the information in the file suggested potential hazards at the site and did not indicate the basis for the Corps’ NDAI determination. We estimate that the Corps either overlooked or failed to adequately assess the potential for hazardous wastes at about 88 percent of the properties. The state environmental agency performed independent reviews in 1999 and 2001 to document any threats or potential threats to human health or the environment posed by the site. reported finding hazardous wastes exceeding state cleanup levels that were believed to have occurred during DOD ownership of this site. Fort Pickens is an approximately 1,600-acre FUDS property on the Florida coast that was used to defend against invasion during World Wars I and II. The Corps identified numerous facilities, including a power plant building, oil houses, ordnance warehouses, an ordnance magazine, search light towers, transformers, electric poles, water and “miscellaneous” facilities, and underground storage tanks. The former Othello Air Force Station (Z-40) was a 77-acre aircraft warning station in the state of Washington. At this site the Corps initially identified approximately 106 facilities, including a diesel plant and an auto maintenance shop. The presence of these facilities suggests the potential for both containerized and freestanding hazardous wastes and ordnance hazards at the property. There was no evidence the Corps considered the former facilities and their characteristics during its assessment and site visit. Despite noting the potential hazards associated with these types of facilities and uses, the Corps designated the site as NDAI. An independent study of this site by the state found hazards (i.e., petroleum compounds such as gasoline, diesel, lube or hydraulic oil) and some chemicals exceeding state cleanup levels. At the Millrock Repair and Storage Depot of New York, the Corps identified potential aboveground storage tanks, gas pumps, a dynamite storage building, and a generator shed. The initial Corps proposal for designating the site as NDAI was rejected by the appropriate Corps district office. A cleanup project was proposed to sample for gasoline-related chemicals at the site of former storage tanks. The Corps overlooked information in its possession indicating possible ordnance hazards. Despite the presence of potential hazards, the file contains no evidence that the Corps took additional steps to determine the source of the hazards or that it reported their presence to the appropriate regulatory agencies. Subsequently, the proposed project was rejected on the grounds that there was no Evidence that the hazards were related to DOD’s use of the site.and a gas pump. At the Mount Vernon Municipal Airport in the state of Washington, a nearly 1,900-acre site previously used by both the Army and the Navy. Although the Corps assessed the site for unsafe buildings and debris and containerized hazards. Corps searched for possible unexploded ordnance despite guidance issued in 1994. In some cases files did not contain evidence that Corps staff conducted a site visit. A site visit is one of the primary methods used by the Corps to determine if the potential hazards are in fact present at a site. For example, if the Corps identifies underground storage tanks as potential hazards because a site was once used as a motor pool facility. A typical site visit would include at least a visual check for signs of. About 18 percent, or 686, of the estimated 3,840 NDAIs in our study population did not receive site visits that met Corps requirements. About 428 properties received no site visits, and about 258 properties received site visits conducted from the air or from a vehicle. For some files designated as NDAI, it appeared that Corps staff remained in their vehicles and took no action before designating the site as an NDAi. The Corps revisited the site and found two underground storage tanks, several 55-gallon drums, and a storage battery. site visit photos from the site’s periphery. hazards typically found at Nike sites include petroleum compounds, paints and solvents, leaking underground storage tanks, and lead from batteries. Gap filler annexes are typically unmanned radar sites that are remotely located. On-site dumps were usually located in secluded areas that “would evade the attention of inspecting military officers,” according to a 1986 guide for assessing Nike missile sites.. Transformers containing toxic wastes (polychlorinated biphenyls) have also been found at. similar sites. Because 30 or more years may pass between the closure of a former defense site and a Corps site visit, it is likely that potential hazards would go unnoticed from a vehicle. The area may be too large to see or may be overgrown with vegetation that could hide any evidence of potential hazards. Corps officials told us that site visits conducted from the air or a vehicle are considered inadequate and would not fulfill the requirement to conduct a site visit. A number of other factors contributed to inadequate preliminary assessments of eligibility. The Corps estimates that at current funding levels, cleaning up the hazards already identified will take more than 70 years. In the files we reviewed, we found no evidence that the Corps consistently notified owners of its NDAI determinations, as required by Corps guidance. The Corps also generally did not notify federal or state regulatory agencies of potential hazards that it identified but determined were not caused by DOD’s use. If the increased funding were approved and sustained, the Corps could complete cleanup by 2050. further study or cleanup actions by DOD were needed. State regulators also told us that they could provide the Corps with best practice guidance on conducting site visits and engaging the public in data-gathering. One example where state involvement has led to the reconsideration of an NDAI determination is the former Wilkins Air Force Base in Ohio, where a school is now located. Following increased public interest in school sites that were once owned by DOD, the Corps designates the property as NDAi. the state regulatory agency became concerned about the number of FUDS in the state where schools or school activities are now located. The Army is taking steps to improve communication among the Army, regulators, and other stakeholders. We also noted during our review of NDAI files that the Corps routinely did not notify regulatory agencies when it identified potential hazards that were not the result of DOD use. The Corps proposed a new project at the former Wilkins Air Force Base. In 2000, the Army created the F UDS Improvement Working Group to (1) address the concerns of regulators and other. stakeholders about the program and (2) identify new or modified policies and procedures. official, it is “common sense’ that the Corps would notify EPA or state regulatory agencies of non-DOD hazards. The Corps does not have a sound basis for about a third of its NDAI determinations for FUDS properties, they say. Without knowing the full extent of the hazards at these properties, the Corps cannot be assured that the properties it is currently cleaning up or that it plans to clean up in the future are the sites that pose the greatest risk. The report recommends that the Corps develop and consistently implement more specific guidelines and procedures for assessing FUDS properties. The Corps should contact other interested parties, including federal, state, and local agencies, as well as owners during the preliminary assessment of eligibility to discuss potential hazards at the properties. DOD disagreed with our conclusions, but partially agreed with each of the three recommendations included in this report. In its comments, DOD stated that the FU DS eligibility determination was never intended as a means to characterize all the hazards at a site. sound basis for its determinations that more than 4,000 formerly used defense sites need no further study or cleanup actions. We reviewed a statistical sample of 635 NDAI files at nine Corps districts that execute the FUDS program. The Alaska district was selected with certainty because it had the highest number of NDAIs when we began our review. Thirty-two of the properties whose files we selected for review were excluded from our analysis because the files contained evidence that either the property was not eligible for the program or that a cleanup project was proposed. GAO conducted review from May 2001 through June 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Report will be available, at no charge, on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov/. The objectives of our review were to determine the extent to which the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) (1) and the Army National Guard (Army NDAI) were working together in a joint effort to build the Keystone XL pipeline. has a sound basis for determining that more than 4,000 formerly used defense sites (FUDS) need no further study or cleanup. We analyzed a statistical sample of 603 NDAI files at nine Corps districts that execute the FUDS program. The districts selected were (1) Alaska, (2) Fort Worth, (3) Jacksonville, (4) Louisville, (5) New York, (6) Omaha, (7) Sacramento, (8) Savannah, and (9) Seattle. Evidence to support the information recorded on the DCI. From the DCIs, we created an electronic database. The members of our team reviewing the files and the person conducting the supervisory review changed for each district. While we rotated staff to reduce bias, we also used this rotation to help increase consistency of judgments. Our error rate was 0.379 percent—less than ½ of 1 percent. All errors found were corrected. In addition, we verified 100 percent of the data for every question, sub-question, and comment box. of the responses to questions and sub-questions on the DCI that were key to supporting our findings. The information presented in this report consists, in part, of statistical estimates based on our review of randomly selected files. The results of our analysis are projectable to NDAI determinations nationwide, excluding the Huntington district. Because we followed a probability procedure based on random selections, our sample is only one of a large number of samples that we could have drawn. We are 95 percent confident that each of the confidence intervals in the report will include the true value in the study population. percentage estimates from the file review have 95 percent confidence intervals. The widths of the confidence intervals are shown as footnotes to the text, where appropriate. All numerical estimates other than percentages (such as averages or totals) have 95% confidence intervals whose width does not exceed 10 percent of the value of those estimates, unless otherwise noted. The results of our analysis are generally projectable nationwide. We also used our selected samples to develop case examples of the preliminary assessments of eligibility conducted by the Corps. These case examples are for illustration only. designating those properties as “No DOD Action Indicated” (NDAI), we reviewed and analyzed a statistical sample of 603 NDAI files at nine Corps districts. Table 2 shows the property name, the FUDS number, and whether we found, based on our review of the evidence in the file, that the Corps had a sound basis for its NDAi determination. In those cases where we do not believe that the corps has a sound base, the table includes an explanation for our finding. containerized hazardous, toxic, and radioactive waste (CON/HTRW); and ordnance and explosive waste (OEW) In addition to those named above, Ian Ferguson, Ken Lightner, Sherry McDonald, and Aaron Shiffrin made key contributions to this report.

Summary:
Recent Congresses have considered legislation to establish a national water commission. Questions arise about the scope and effect of the 1973 National Water Commission report. The responsibility for development, management, and allocation of the nation's water resources is spread among federal, state, local, tribal, and private interests. Congress has generally deferred to the states' primacy in intrastate water allocation.. The report provides an overview of key issues and recommendations identified by the NWC; it neither covers the entire NWC report nor provides an exhaustive assessment of progress. concept of state primacy in water allocation or controlling water management decisions. Congress has not enacted any comprehensive—or overarching—change in federal water resources management or national water policy since 1965. Congress, which represents local interests, often has reacted to proposals to change or reorganize water organizations and institutions as attempts to exert federal control over state and local matters. Any attempt to untangle the complexities of current water policy involves many constituencies with differing interests, and becomes politically difficult to sustain, authors say. The National Water Commission was created by Congress in 1968 to "provide for a comprehensive review of national water resource problems and programs" Congress specifically tasked the Commission to (1) review present and anticipated national waterResource problems, including making projections of water "requirements" and alternative ways of meeting such requirements. (2) consider economic and social consequences of water resource development; and (3) advise on such specific water resource matters as might be referred to it by the President and the then-existing Water Resources Council. Members of Congress from the Pacific Northwest objected to proposals to transfer water from the Columbia River Basin to supply the needs of states in the Southwest. A political compromise was reached to create a commission to study water resource problems. The National Water Commission was made up of seven members appointed by the President. None was allowed to be a federal employee, but some, including chairman Charles F. Luce, had formerly held senior positions in the federal government. Members were chosen largely for their expertise in a variety of areas. fields related to water resource management. No special interests were required to be represented. Progress has been made on addressing many of the problems identified by the Commission. But few actions can be directly traced to the Commission's 1973 recommendations. In 1978, the report's executive director, Theodore Schad, noted that the report had remained in "limbo," awaiting mandated action from the WRC and final transmission from the President to the Congress. It appears these actions [WRC] have not yet been taken. comments and recommendations from the President to Congress] will never be taken. President Nixon became preoccupied with his defense against the Watergate scandals which ultimately led to his resignation. The Ford administration occupied itself with the Section 80 study of water policy. And the Carter administration appears to have accepted Santayana's comment as its precept [that "those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it" The change from federal grants to loans for local water quality activities is consistent with the Commission's recommendation for an end to such grants. In 1973, the National Water Commission published its final report, Water Policies for the Future. The Commission found that many of the country's water policies were based on outdated goals and objectives. The report was based on hundreds of documents, special studies contracted by the Commission, eight public hearings, and other meetings. Despite the evolution in water policy, many problems identified by the commission remain today, authors say.. The influence of a commission may lie in how its recommendations combine with other drivers to create support for an evolution in policy, they say. Many of the water and natural environment concerns raised by the NWC have been addressed via implementation of environmental laws at their infancy in 1973. Many of the largest current federal water actions are attempting to address environmental or species concerns through ecosystem restoration and stream rehabilitation. Whether these recent efforts will perform as planned and whether the federal-nonfederal collaboration central to many of them will function effectively and efficiently remains a question. The Commission's recommendations ranged across numerous fields, including reservoir development, flood policy, estuaries and the coastal zone. The Commission supported greater application of "users pay" and "beneficiary pays" approaches. Cost recovery remains part of the ongoing discussions of the proper federal role in water policy. The elements of the final report that addressed water pollution control were some of the most controversial, chiefly because the Commission rejected some key concepts that Congress had recently adopted in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (P.L. 92-500; 33 U.S.C. §1251 et seq.) the Clean Water Act (CWA). The draft final report was released one month after enactment of that major law. The Commission rejected the zero discharge goal and the core regulatory approach central to the CWA. The CWA is viewed today as one of the most successful environmental laws in terms of achieving its statutory goals. The need to adequately fund pollution control activities, highlighted in several recommendations, also remains a challenge for policymakers, the Commission also said. It said the Commission made observations that remain valid about the extent of water pollution problems, despite water quality improvements since then. focused on the scarcity of water as a resource and adapting to more efficient use and allocation. It suggested that procedural mechanisms and legal regulations, including adjustments to water rights, be implemented to ensure that water was used efficiently and effectively. Congress has enacted legislation protecting social and noneconomic values while respecting the state-based water rights frameworks. Many states also have modified their water rights systems to protect social values. The Commission described water supply in the West as limited and near full appropriation, and it framed the Indian water rights issue as a conflict in theWest between Indian rights to water and water development. The Commission found that future water requirements could not be fully assessed without taking into account how water resources are governed and what institutional structures guide their management, use, and allocation. The Commission predicted a less significant role for large-scale federal project development than in the past. It concluded that federal investment in water resources projects was inefficient for achieving regional economic development. It noted that important non-quantitative issues and judgments were buried in the analysis of some plans, and that federal planning requirements for states were costly while producing unclear state benefits. The discount rate for federal water projects is the one-year average yield of long-term government securities. Some economists argue that the rate should reflect displacement of private investment. The benefits of moving to a different rate, which may affect the evaluation and selection of a project, and federal participation in it, continue to be debated. In the late 1990s, the Western Water Policy Review Advisory Commission (WWPRAC) recommended a pilot program using a tiered or "nested" approach to water resources governance. Since 1992, Congress has authorized and funded the Corps to provide technical assistance for municipal water and wastewater projects in selected locations. Congress created a Reclamation program to investigate opportunities for water reuse in the West. Federal agency participation in state and local planning efforts has been constrained by the focus of the budget and appropriations process on specific projects, rather than broader planning efforts. Some states, such as California, Texas, and Florida, have undertaken their own planning efforts, often geared toward water supply augmentation and drought management. Commission found that project development needs tended to dominate over concerns about the potential environmental impacts of a project. The Commission recognized NEPA as a potential tool to include environmental concerns in the decision-making process. Since 1973, NEPA's procedural requirements may have become clearer, but the overall process is more complicated for reasons that have little to do with NEPA itself. To integrate compliance with any environmental requirements, agencies must prepare the EIS with any federal permits, licenses, or certification required to implement the project. The Commission found the then-active WRC an important and useful mechanism. It recommended changes to help the WRC better fulfill its roles of coordinating and appraising water policies and programs. The Commission recommended combining NOAA and USGS into a new DOI agency responsible for water resources data. The WRC has not been funded or active since 1983; however, the authorization for the W RC still exists.. Since 1973, significant shifts have occurred in the federal water resources institutional arrangements and organizations; but the federalist division of responsibilities has remained largely intact. Review of federal water projects also has experienced many shifts since 1973. There is no entity that independently reviews water projects by all federal agencies. The Corps has maintained its construction program, although not at its 1960s level. Reclamation too has moved more toward management and has a less substantial construction function than it did in the 1950s and 1960s..within watersheds and between states has been constrained by the focus on specific projects. What remains of the federal planning assistance generally is a few programs scattered among several agencies. Reclamation has adopted a new mission statement recognizing its increased role in water resources management vis-à-vis construction. Recent Reclamation efforts have included working with other DOI, federal agencies, and nonfederal parties, including Tribes. The challenge of accomplishing organizational changes like the Commission's NOAA recommendations was seen when the Secretary of the Interior in the mid-1990s attempted to consolidate the biological research being conducted by DOI's various agencies into a single agency. The effort was met with much resistance and skepticism, eventually being scaled back. Dam repair and safety remain areas of growing engineering and construction. Congress has authorized and appropriated funds for Corps participation in municipal drinking water and wastewater projects. In an effort to define the scope of the Corps' involvement in the growing area of ecosystem restoration, the G.O.P. Commission has recommended limiting Corps design and construction activities to those that cannot be efficiently performed by nonfederal entities. The Commission's recommendation has not been a criterion used during authorization and appropriations. The Corps has worked with states and local agencies to carry out engineering works to improve flood control. The Bush Administration in recent budgets used as one of its criteria for restoration projects that the Corps be uniquely well suited to perform the work. The Commission's recommendation to increase the Corps' nonfederal assistance actions has not been implemented. The Corps has retained its Planning Assistance to States program and its Flood Plain Management Service, which in recent years have averaged roughly $6 million each in annual appropriations. In the mid-1970s, the Corps received roughly $30 million for regional planning and planning assistance to states. Since 1973, the amount of the federal budget dedicated to all types of water research has been halved. Aspects of water resources have remained scattered across congressional committees. Without the WRC, CEQ at times and other ad hoc mechanisms have been used to arbitrate and coordinate among federal agencies on water issues. The Commission found that the steps by which separate branches of government conceived and executed water resources projects needed to be closely linked, or coordinated, to efficiently use the nation's water and fiscal resources. initiated by congressional appropriations. There has been no requirement that new construction starts that were authorized many years prior be re-evaluated. The backlog of construction authorizations created tension between the G. W. Bush Administration, whose Corps budget concentrated funding on a smaller set of projects, and Congress. An argument for concentrated appropriations is that the lower funding levels that individual projects receive under the distributed approach delay construction progress. Those supporting a more distributed appropriations process argue that a geographical and jurisdictional dispersal of projects maintains the currency and relevance of the Corps' mission. Annual federal appropriations for water resources projects followed a declining trend after the mid-1960s. The Commission found that the federal government insufficiently addressed ecological processes and environmental values in its water project and permitting decisions. Many of the concerns raised by the NWC have been addressed via implementation of environmental laws. Few new large-scale U.S. reservoirs are currently under construction, although some are being considered. There is no requirement to protect the overall function of ecosystems and some argue that no such requirement is needed. The Commission called for collecting and organizing a broad range of data on the condition of the nation's water. The Commission report suggested including not only water quantity and quality factors but also geological attributes, soil properties, riparian vegetation, fisheries and climate factors, aesthetics, related land uses, and recreation use. Although a national concern, the Commission report also called for the creation of a federal agency to manage the water resources of the U.S. and to provide information to the public about the state of water resources. Some basic water flow data are being collected on a national level. The streamflow program is based on partnerships with local sponsors and is not comprehensive. Data are also collected on wetland losses due to human activities such as agriculture, urban development, and water resources projects. The USGS also works with states to estimate water withdrawals and assess water quality in various water bodies. But overall levels of federal funding and the number of stream gages have declined in recent years.. Attempts have been made to better coordinate data collection and improve the quality of NWC recommended analyzing the environmental impacts of water resources proposals. NEPA implementation has resulted in a more comprehensive environmental analysis of project plans. Non-federal interests play a much larger role than previously, and in some cases have become active "partners" in the decision-making process. Water resource planning continues to be criticized for a narrow focus on national economic development benefits or specific development objectives and insufficient evaluation and weighing of environmental and social concerns (such as public safety and social equity) The 110 th Congress called for the Secretary of the Army to update water resources planning principles and guidelines to better account for the environment. adaptive management is the process of incorporating new scientific and programmatic information into the implementation of a plan. It is a management approach that allows flexibility to adjust strategies during implementation if goals are not being met or if new circumstances arise. The use of adaptive management in water resources to date has largely been limited to select restoration efforts and has yet to be used across all types of projects and their operations. Concerns with using adaptive management include the potential for cost growth of restoration efforts, the delegation of decisions to agency staff or even nonfederal parties. WRDA 2007 also added monitoring as an authorized activity for many specific Corps projects. The impact of these provisions remains unknown, due to the early stage of their implementation. The Corps and the Federal Emergency Management Agency are the principal federal agencies involved in programs to reduce riverine and coastal flood damages and risk. The Commission found that despite significant investments to reduce flood damages, annual flood losses grew and people continued living in harm's way. It recommended federal efforts that: encourage floodplain management that maximizes national economic, social, and environmental welfare. WRDA 2007 may be an early step in a reorientation of flood policy if its provisions are implemented. Since 1973, numerous legislative provisions and administrative actions have addressed flood risk. Many of these have seen only marginal implementation, enforcement, and funding. Current arrangements of aid, insurance, and water resources projects are criticized for providing disincentives to "wise use" of flood-prone areas. The 110 th Congress, in WRDA 2007, called for the Secretary of the Army to update water resources planning guidance. Concerns continue to be raised about the degree of subsidization under the NFIP and the financial foundation of the program. Reorganization of emergency response, in particular the placement of FEMA within the Department of Homeland Security, remains a topic of much debate. Hurricane Katrina, levee breaks in California and Nevada, and the 2008 Midwest floods have increased the recent debate about the program and its funding. In 2006, an independent review working group released its evaluation of the NFip. The recommendations are among other changes that have been considered, but not enacted, as part of recent NFIP legislation. how to manage flood, coastal, and aging infrastructure risks. What is an acceptable level of risk, especially for low-probability, high-consequence events? Who should bear the costs to reduce these risks? The policy issue is how to use limited fiscal resources to address a wide range of concerns, they say. The challenge is to structure actions and programs so they provide incentives to limit flood-prone lands to their best use, the authors say, without infringing on private property rights or usurping local decision making. Levee overtopping and failure contribute to approximately one-third of all flood disasters. A large percentage of locally built levees are poorly designed and maintained. How to address levee reliability and various levels of protection is a current issue that did not receive much attention in the Commission's report.WRDA 2007 builds on some post-Katrina actions that supported developing a levee inventory. It requires the Corps to establish and maintain a database with an inventory of the nation's levees by 2009. Drought in many parts of the country also is drawing attention to options for capturing and treating urban stormwater as a potential water supply. Stormwater is increasingly being seen as a resource (e.g., for reuse), rather than only for its negative effects on water quality and urban flooding. Estuaries are considered some of the most biologically rich areas on earth. Many animal species rely on estuaries for habitat, especially for places to spawn or nest and for nurseries to support early life stages and juveniles. Over half of the U.S. population now lives in coastal watershed counties. Commission found that the nation's estuaries and shorelands had been "subjected to massive physical modification" Several pieces of legislation have been enacted and programs implemented to protect the coasts and Estuaries since 1973. The type of integration envisioned by the Commission was constrained by the contraction of large-scale water resource planning efforts in the 1980s. The National Estuary Program (NEP) arguably have caused the most significant movement toward the Commission's recommendation. especially to urban and rural development have been substantially slowed and even slightly reversed nationally in recent years. The same trends are not occurring in coastal areas, where data indicate that coastal watersheds have been losing a substantial amount of wetlands. The Commission identified the negative environmental effects of channelization as an issue. Since the Commission's report, most federal channelization efforts, such as those at USDA and the Corps, have been abolished or gone unfunded. Some plans using channelization are still developed as components of flood damage reduction, navigation, and other federal projects. The Commission found that water projects often had been planned and developed with little regard for fish and wildlife impacts. The Commission expressed concern that state and federal legislation at the time might not fully address these impacts. Today, there are many more threats to fish and. wildlife resources than impacts from federal water project development. These threats include destruction of habitat due to. other development, invasive non-native species, climate variability and change, and. pollution, the FWS notes. The NWC may have contributed to improvements, but indirectly. 1983. The NWC recommendation supporting more fish and wildlife research at a national level has not been implemented. There is, however, greater understanding than existed in 1973 of how certain types of water projects such as reservoirs can affect fisheries and other species. For example, in the Columbia River Basin, considerable research has been done on the effects of water infrastructure on fisheries and habitat. Similarly, much research has done on fisheries affected by Reclamation projects in California and elsewhere. Insufficient scientific understanding of when, how much, and the quality of the water needed to sustain fisheries continues to plague some conflicts. for fish and wildlife resources on non-federally managed waters, similar to the FWCA on federal projects. State efforts are aided by federal programs, some of which have been strengthened since 1973. Chapter 15 identified a host of negative effects associated with what the Commission termed "deficiencies" in federal cost-share policies. Taken together, effects of the identified deficiencies can best be described as "negative effects" of federal cost share policies on sport fishery resources, conservation, and restoration. as inefficiencies in federal water resources management. The negative effects of these issues were found to be numerous. The Commission recommended many changes in federal cost-share policies. Specific recommendations include recovery of federal costs and ensuring that project beneficiaries pay proportional development and operating costs for water programs or activities. The recommendations are too numerous and context-specific to address in this analysis; but a few major topics (inland navigation, irrigation water supply, and municipal water and wastewater treatment) are discussed in separate sections below. of projects unless there is some social benefit to a federal "subsidy" Concerns over appropriate levels of nonfederal and federal cost share, their consistency across agencies and water resource purposes, remain today. While it may be an efficient way to allocate scarce federal resources, instituting "beneficiary pays" or "users pay" fee policies remains difficult politically. The determination of appropriate cost shares for federal water resource projects, and to some degree for water quality infrastructure, continues to be an issue in federal water policy and management. The Commission recommended that inland waterway users, both freight and pleasure craft, be charged a user fee set to recover all operation and maintenance costs. The Commission recommended a uniform fuel tax plus a lockage fee to be phased in over ten years. Congress enacted the Inland Waterways Revenue Act ( P.L. 95 - 502 , §202; 26 U.S.C. 4042) which imposed a 4 cents per gallon fuel tax on freight barges beginning in 1980. Congress has resisted attempts to raise inland waterways user charges. Congress has debated the level of user fees for waterways. Equity and economic arguments can be made for imposing a full cost-recovery user fee. Rail and pipeline industries, which compete with the barge industry, finance their infrastructure without public funds. If barge rates are subsidized, the nation incurs a higher overall cost for freight, authors say. fees, congestion tolls, lockage fees, per ton-mile fees, and combinations are among the options, they say. Reclamation Act of 1902 authorized the construction of projects to provide water for irrigation in western states. Originally, Reclamation projects were to be financed through the sale of public lands. In 1982, Congress enacted Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 (RRA; 97 - 293), which addresses some acreage limitation issues. In 1992, RRA increases the acreage limit for water users who comply with the new law, while allowing others to remain under "priororor" law. For those electing to comply, the new water limit was raised from the original 160 acres under the original law. included in CVPIA, as well as new fees to support fish and wildlife restoration and mitigation; however, these provisions apply only to the CVP. Tiered water pricing provisions of the C VPIA—intended to encourage water conservation—remain particularly controversial. In sum, while Congress addressed some aspects of both acreage limitation and the interest subsidy in 1982, these issues remain "third-rail" policy issues when it comes to Reclamation oversight. For example, 25 years after the 1973 NWC report, the Western Water Policy Review Advisory Commission made similar recommendations. The National Water Commission issued a report on water quality in the U.S. The report noted that proper pricing would conserve scarce water supplies. Water utilities and systems vary widely in adoption of conservation- or efficiency-oriented rate and pricing policies. The issue remains a concern for federal policymakers, the report says. toxic pollutants can harm human health and the environment even when present in very small amounts, says the NWC.. The Commission made a number of recommendations related to water pollution control. It noted that existing monitoring and surveillance programs were inadequate. The 1972 Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments (FWPCA; P.L. 92-500) were controversial. The goal of zero discharge of pollutants into the nation's waters by 1985 was not attained by 1985. The fundamental policy and programmatic approach to water pollution control adopted in the 1972 act remains central to the CWA. The need to adequately fund pollution control activities, highlighted in several recommendations, also remains a challenge for policymakers, authors say.. The CWA is viewed today as one of the most successful environmental laws in terms of achieving its statutory goals, they say. P.L. 92-500 greatly expanded what previously had been a fairly small program of grants to aid construction of municipal sewage treatment plants. The issue of how large the federal assistance role should be and how long it should continue remains contentious. The grants program continued through 1989, and it has now been replaced by a revolving loan fund program. To be effective, planning must be done on a regional or areawide basis, ideally incorporating water quality, water supply, other resource planning, and other planning. The National Water Commission called for waste management planning to be done on a larger scale than purely local bases. States today are at the forefront in establishing long-term water management plans. The Commission advocated shared federal and state responsibility for designing and implementing water pollution control policy. The federal government establishing national policy, and states (and localities) carrying out day-to-day implementation.. Monitoring and data collection to aid understanding of water quality trends and to help inform better decisions in the future. The Commission recommended a major role for the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) through a comprehensive water quality monitoring surveillance network. Monitoring activities today are carried out by all levels of government and nongovernmental entities. Information gleaned from these data are used to inform policymakers and the public about the status and trends of water quality. The Commission also identified needs for research in several areas, such as technology development, alternative waste treatment and disposal methods, and methods of controlling nonpoint sources of pollution. Shortages of adequate resources are a chronic problem for implementation of public policies. Congress and the President should be prepared to fully fund all activities. States and localities should fully fund their activities, the Commission said. The Commission made a number of other observations and related recommendations in areas that were fully addressed in the 1972 FWPCA and have been integral to CWA programs since then. It is unclear why these observations and recommendations were not addressed in 1972 and remain relevant to the CWA today.  issues drew the Commission's attention, unless the Commission anticipated that the new statutory provisions would not be implemented. Water rights traditionally are regulated by states, rather than the federal government. Depending on individual state resources and historic development, it may use one of three water rights doctrines: riparian, prior appropriation, or a hybrid of the two. Under the riparian doctrine, a person who owns land that borders a watercourse has the right to make reasonable use of the water on that land. Under a prior appropriation system of water rights, users apply for a permit from a state administrative agency. The Commission on Water Resources looked at water rights in the U.S. It said water supply is limited and should yield the highest return to social well-being. The Commission's recommendations fell into three categories: transfer of water rights, recognition of social values in water. The recommendations were directed toward state governments, as well as states, as states regulate water rights. system allows water users to acquire well-defined rights to water as a limited resource that requires planning to avoid scarcity, authors say. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968 allowed the federal government to ensure protection of certain waters from development. The legislation has been both of general application and specifically targeted to certain federal water projects. In 1992, Congress enacted the CVPIA, which amended the original authorization for the Central Valley Project to include consideration of fish and wildlife preservation. The act allows the government to recognize aesthetic and recreational values of the rivers and prevent uses that would diminish those values, principles reflected in the Commission's recommendations. The CVPIA specifically allocated 800,000 acre-feet of project water for fish and wildlife purposes. While there has been limited action to encourage water transfers, no blanket national policy has been declared in accord with the Commission's recommendations. Because the law of water rights, including the specific system that a state uses, is a matter of state discretion, the federal government's action is limited by principles of federalism. A number of traditionally riparian states have modified their systems to account for permitting concerns. State-federal tensions over proper and respective roles and responsibilities in water resource development, management, and allocation, continue to cloud resolution to the most difficult water resource issues. Expectations for a commission to directly achieve changes in a system resistant to transformation may be unreasonable. Instead the influence of a commission may be how its recommendations combine with other drivers to create sufficient support for an evolution in policy.of overall benefits to the nation. Signed into law on January 1, 1970, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA; P.L. 91-190) declared a national policy to protect the environment. NEPA establishes the basic framework for integrating environmental considerations into federal decision making. With an initial absence of regulations specifying implementation procedures, federal agencies reacted in different ways to NEPA's requirements. In the 1970s, many agencies had difficulty complying with the law. In an effort to standardize an increasingly complicated NEPA process, President Carter directed CEQ to issue regulations that would be legally binding on federal agencies; final regulations became effective on July 30, 1979. The CEQ regulations were intended to be generic in nature. with the intent of NEPA. NEPA is a federal law that aims to make it easier for states to legalize marijuana. The law was passed in 2010 and has been in effect since 2012. It was designed to allow for the production of marijuana in states with high levels of marijuana use.

Summary:
The electric utility industry was considered one of the nation’s most regulated industries. In the past, electricity service providers enjoyed a natural monopoly. Restructuring is underway for wholesale markets, which involve the sale of electricity for resale. States, however, vary greatly in their response to restructuring, authors say. They say some states have introduced competition to the retail markets in their states, others have begun to restructure but then delayed or suspended these efforts, and others still have taken no steps to restruct their markets. FERC and EIA are the two leading entities for the collection, analysis, and evaluation of electric power information. FERC collects information to assure just and reasonable rates on the basis of costs. EIA is mandated to collect, assemble, evaluate, analyze, and disseminate energy data and energy information for the Congress, the federal government, the states, and the public. The Federal Power Act (FPA) of 1935, PURPA, and EPACT drive FERC’s information collection activities. The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) is one of the most important nonfederal entities that collect data from the electricity industry. NERC, formed as a result of a devastating outage in the northeast during November 1965, was established to promote the reliability of the interconnected electric power system. One of its key functions is to collect information from its members, and provides a forum for the electric utility industry to develop policies, standards, and guidelines designed to ensure reliability. OMB is also responsible for the implementation of the Government Paperwork Elimination Act. Federal agencies collect three types of electricity-related information for widely varying purposes. FERC, EIA, RUS, SEC, and EPA specifically collect information related to generation, transmission, and/or distribution functions of electric power. Restructuring has led to a greater need for a second type of information, focusing on current activities, for purposes of monitoring by FERC in particular. Third-party sources, such as Bloomberg’s Professional Services, provide current and historical information on regional electricity and gas markets. FERC, an independent regulatory agency, was established in 1977 as a successor to the Federal Power Commission. Among its other duties, it reviews the rates set by the four federal power marketing administrations. FERC does not have legislative authority over electricity generation siting, construction of transmission lines, intrastate transmission, or retail sales. It also has no direct authority over system reliability—that is, ensuring that consumers can obtain electricity from the system, when, and in the amount they want. EIA is the principal source of comprehensive energy information for the Congress, the federal government, the states, and the public. EIA and its customers use the information it collects for a variety of purposes. Fossil Energy collects information on electric power imports and exports from both presidential permit and authorized export holders. The mandatory information is used in an annual report that summarizes the electricity trade between the U.S. and Mexico or Canada during each calendar year. (See app. II for FERC’s third-party sources of current market information.) Fossil Energy official tells us that EIA will eventually take over the responsibility of collecting information on imports and exports of electricity. EPA’s mission requires it to collect electricity-related information for regulatory purposes. The Acid Rain Program specifies that all existing utility units serving generators with an output capacity of greater than 25 megawatts must report their emissions. The emissions that must be reported include sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and carbon dioxide. While not an emission, the unit heat input (the caloric value of the fuel burned) must also be reported. monitoring system. Units report hourly emissions information to EPA on a quarterly basis. At the end of each calendar year, EPA uses this information to compare the tons of actual emissions reported with each company’s authorized emissions. If a company exceeds its limits, then it will be penalized in accordance with the rules of the program. An EPA report in February 1998 identified mercury emitted by coal-fired electric utilities. It represents a significant commitment of personnel with about 40 full-time-equivalent staff currently assigned to its maintenance and use. mercury emissions from coal-fired plants as the toxic air pollutant of greatest concern for public health from these sources. EPA has also developed the Emissions and Generation Resource Integrated Database, the first complete database of emissions and resource mix for virtually every power plant and company that generates electricity in the United States. The information, which encompasses more than 4,600 power plants and nearly 2,000 generating companies, is used to provide plant-specific analyses of emissions. It can also be aggregated at various levels, for example, individual. states and larger regions, to provide more comprehensive analyses of issues relating to air quality. RUS is a lending agency whereas EIA is a statistical agency and FERC and EPA are regulatory agencies. Officials are interested in obtaining information on the sale and purchase of electricity and especially in determining whether their borrowers are buying and selling power from each other. Officials told us that it provided about $4 billion in loans during 2002 and has a total of about $34 billion in outstanding funds plus new new funds. 45 percent or more of the electricity sold by rural electricity cooperatives comes from outside sources. Potential borrowers have to meet RUS’s criteria as serving rural consumers and also criteria for financial viability. Some loans to nonprofit cooperatives are for facilities that may become part of a transmission system operated by an independent system operator ( ISO) or a regional transmission organization (RTO) RUS uses two main forms to collect the relevant information. Both forms state their purpose as being to review an applicant’S financial situation. The SEC was established under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as an independent, nonpartisan, quasi-judicial regulatory agency. As of October 31, 2002, there were 18 electricity-and-gas and 7 electricity-only, registered holding companies. Other agencies, including the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, do not collect information on an ongoing, regular basis. The collection of information ensures that SEC has comprehensive information on holding companies conducting substantial activities in more than one state. Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have responsibilities to enforce antitrust laws, among others. The impetus for these investigations may come from the trade press and other news sources. If a trend emerges, additional general information is gathered on the issue. This may lead to a finding that there is no further ground for concern or to the opening of a formal investigation. The Federal Trade commission has no ongoing information collection or standardized forms to obtain information on electricity markets, an assistant general counsel says. The agency’s activity is largely confined to two reports and some comments on other federal and state agencies’ proposed rulemakings. The Federal Trade Commission has discontinued its information collection on electricity markets. The agency’s role in reviewing mergers, including those involving the electricity industry, has declined. Restructuring, which has led to increasingly complex market activities with greater need for oversight, has highlighted the need for sharing information. Agencies are increasingly using the Internet and a mix of other methods to enhance their ability to share information with other agencies and the public. In the past, agencies provided paper copies of reports. Since the advent of the Internet, most federal agencies are using it to allow access to documents. Restructuring has significantly affected FERC while other agencies were affected to a lesser extent. To diminish gaps in its information, FERC relies on information from third-party sources, some of which is suspect. FERC created a new office to actively monitor competitive electricity markets and undertook efforts to identify sources of market information and better understand its own information needs. The formation of these organizations remains in question. FERC says it has no jurisdiction over power sales by federally owned entities, publicly owned utilities. Nonjurisdictional utilities own 27 percent of the U.S. electric transmission system. They serve large areas of the country and provide service in conjunction with 25 percent of nation's demand for electricity. FERC does not collect price information, for example, on up-to-the-minute electricity prices, fuel costs, and spot and futures contract prices, authors say. They say FERC also needs information on electricity imports from neighboring countries, particularly Canada. FERC cannot access other nonfederal information it needs to assess reliability of the power grid and monitor overall electricity market performance. Price and transaction information, as well as operational information, is important in order for FERC to be able to detect changes in the market, determine the legitimacy of market outcomes, and if needed, take corrective action. FERC lacks regulatory authority over all entities in wholesale electricity markets and is therefore unable to gather all of the information it needed to understand markets across the nation. FERC surveyed reporting firms for both natural gas and electricity and found that these firms lacked formal verification or corroboration. FERC reported that this lack of verification allowed an opportunity for entities to deliberately misreport information in order to manipulate prices and/or volumes in electricity. In at least one recent instance, FERC used such third-party information as a basis of a key decision regarding California’s electricity market. The information, however, later turned out to be inaccurate. Using this methodology, the judge ordered refunds of about $1.8 billion to the state of California. FERC plans to rely extensively on RTOs and ISOs to assist in its monitoring efforts. FERC officials said they expect to have access to all the data collected by the market monitors. According to FERC, it currently obtains timely information from some existing RTO and ISO monitors to help support its market oversight processes. However, relative to the Paperwork Reduction Act, they are not sure whether the market monitor will be able to collect information on FERC’s behalf that FERC itself has not been authorized to collect. FERC’s effort to expand the number and/or market coverage of RTOs as well as standardize electricity market rules has met with resistance from the Congress, state commissions, and others. FERC believes that market transparency provisions in proposed legislation will address issues related to jurisdictional entities that don’t participate in RTO. Among the other agencies, EIA has been the most affected by restructuring while the EPA has been more stable. The U.S. Department of Energy says it is working with FERC to address the issues raised in this report.  restructuring has led to changes in the number of entities from which EIA collects data. It has expanded EIA’s database by about 2,000 new sources of information and has nearly doubled its database. EIA now posts electricity prices for several of the largest markets on its Web site. The third effect of restructuring on EIA is to significantly alter the way that EIA examines energy sectors and electricity in particular. EIA has had to revise its energy models to accommodate restructuring because of changes in how electricity is supplied and distributed. Past, some companies failed to answer a question about the delivered fuel price on EIA’s Form 423. Congress is considering repealing or modifying PUHCA because the emergence of nonutilities reflects the fact that utilities are no longer the sole source of electricity energy. Restructuring has not had significant effects on the collection of electricity information by the other agencies included in our review. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has established the legal framework to address some of the concerns related to corporate disclosure. The number of electricity entity mergers has slowed down, but should these mergers increase, Justice may need to increase its information collections for merger investigations. The Commodities Futures Trading Commission has reinstated its practice of collecting information on these trades. Events such as the collapse of Enron Corporation bring to light jurisdictional issues in helping to oversee electricity markets more generally, the authors say. The authors conclude that the agencies should become more involved in collecting electricity information as competitive markets develop. The Authors: The agencies should also be aware of the impact of electricity restructuring on their respective roles. FERC and SEC have been questioned about their lack of diligence in following through on Enron’s activities. Enron took advantage of jurisdictional gaps that enabled it to earn tens of millions of dollars above what it would have otherwise earned from its wind farms. FERC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission provide a second example of problems resulting from jurisdictional uncertainties. Until Enron's collapse, the two agencies did not participate in meaningful discussions to identify and coordinate their respective roles. Restructuring has made the issue of confidentiality concerning electricity information more prominent. The sensitivity of this information, according to the companies asked to provide it, is greater because of fears that other companies could use it to seek competitive advantages. This dilemma has led to controversy about the electricity information that is to be made publicly available and shared with other federal agencies. Both EIA and FERC have procedures regarding restrictions on access to information and have modified these procedures, as appropriate, they say. 9/11 has heightened national security concerns about protecting the nation’s energy. the date of this letter.

Summary:
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) is a law enforcement agency within the Department of the Treasury with responsibilities directed toward reducing violent crime, collecting revenue, and protecting the public. Suspicion of illegal firearms activities is the principal reason that initiates ATF firearms investigations. ATF has come under public criticism and congressional scrutiny primarily as a result of its operation at the Branch Davidians’ compound in Waco, TX, and citizen accusations that ATF agents used excessive force in carrying out their enforcement responsibilities. Lawmakers: Use of force has been construed to include a wide range of techniques used to compel compliance. The variety of coercive options available to agents in a confrontational setting is often referred to as the “force continuum.” In October 1995, Treasury and the Department of Justice adopted use of deadly force guidelines that are uniform with the exception of certain agency mission-specific provisions. While warning shots generally are not permitted under the Treasury and Justice policies, the U.S. Secret Service may use warning shots in exercising its protective responsibilities. visited the FBI and DEA Washington field divisions to compare ATF’s use of dynamic entries and equipment to other federal law enforcement agencies. We identified and reviewed files related to the investigation of reported shooting and use of excessive force incidents during fiscal years 1990 through 1995. We also reviewed literature available from IACP and other law enforcement experts regarding the use of equipment, dynamic entries, and other tactics. We did not evaluate the quality and adequacy of the shooting and using excessive force investigations or the validity of their conclusions. 1996, meetings, the Senior Advisor to the Under Secretary of the Treasury for Enforcement and ATF officials provided Treasury’s comments. Also present at the Justice meeting were officials from the Office of the Attorney General, the Criminal Division, DEA, and FBI. The Treasury and Justice officials either characterized the report as balanced, accurate, and thorough or had no comments. They provided some technical comments that we have incorporated in this report, where appropriate. State rules and Supreme Court guidance on the use of deadly force have been evolving for a number of years. Many states followed something similar to the English common-law rule on the use of deadly force. The 1982 Tennessee statute, found unconstitutional, was based on the fleeing felon rule. The Model Penal Code approach imposes several qualifications on the Use of Deadly Force. It is not justified unless the arrest is for a felony or there is a substantial risk that the suspect will cause death or serious bodily harm if his apprehension is delayed, the law says. The American Law Institute formulated the Model Penal code in 1962. In Garner, a police officer shot and killed Edward Garner to prevent his escape from the scene of a burglary. The officer argued that his actions were reasonable under a Tennessee statue that provided that a law enforcement officer could use any means necessary to make an arrest. “Where the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others, it is not constitutionally unreasonable to prevent escape by using deadly force,” the court said. The Supreme Court provided some clarification as to how courts should examine allegations that law enforcement officers have used excessive force. In Graham, a diabetic felt the onset of an insulin reaction and drove with a friend to a convenience store to purchase orange juice. A police officer became suspicious, followed Graham’s car, and made an investigative stop. Graham sustained various physical injuries during the incident, and was thrown headfirst into the police car. The officers refused to let him have some orange juice as a remedy for his condition. the officers learned that nothing had happened at the store. Graham brought an action against the officers involved in the incident alleging that the officers had used excessive force in making the investigatory stop. The District Court applied a four-factor test and ruled in the officers’ favor. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, without attempting to identify the specific constitutional provision under which Graham’s claim arose, endorsed the four-Factor test applied by the District Court and affirmed the Court of appeals decision. In October 1995, Treasury and Justice adopted use of deadly force policies to standardize the various policies their component agencies had adopted over the years. The policies are uniform with the exception of certain agency mission-specific provisions covering, for example, Justice’s prisoner-related responsibilities. The Justice and Treasury uniform policies provide that their respective officers may use deadly force only when necessary, that is, when the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury. reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person. The commentaries recognize that the reasonableness of a belief or decision must be viewed from the point of view of the officer at the time of the use of deadly force. They provide that “probable cause,” “reason to believe,’ or a “reasonable belief” for purposes of their policies, mean facts and circumstances, including reasonable inferences. perspective of the officer on the scene, who may often be forced to make split-second decisions. Justice and Treasury commentaries also state that as used in their respective policies, “imminent” has a broader meaning than ‘immediate’ or ‘instantaneous’ The concept of ‘Imminent’ should be understood to be elastic, that is, involving a period of time dependent on the circumstances, rather than the fixed point of time implicit in the concept. The 1988 ATF and 1995 Treasury policies generally authorize the use of such force. Both policies limit the degree of force authorized to that which is needed to accomplish the law enforcement purpose. The 1988 ATF use of deadly force policy was consistent with DEA and FBI policies in effect prior to the 1995 uniform policies. The policies described in this chapter contain additional guidance regarding specific situations, such as fleeing persons, escaping prisoners, verbal warnings, warning shots, and shooting at or from vehicles. This additional additional guidance can be found in appendix I. Since 1988, ATF has maintained a policy that was consistent with prior FBI and DEA policies. ATF policy requires that ATF agents be reminded of the deadly force policy at least quarterly throughout their careers. All new ATF agents are required to attend the FLETC’s Criminal Investigator Training Program (CITP) This program, which in fiscal year 1996 is to be expanded to approximately 9 weeks, provides basic training in a broad range of skills that criminal investigators require. Students are to receive over 175 hours of training in the classroom/lecture, 117 hours of laboratory work, and 39 hours of practical exercises. FLETC provides a 2-hour course on Firearms Policy during the first week of training. In Judgment Pistol Shooting (3 hours), students are to use a weapon that has been altered to shoot a laser beam. Students are shown a video illustrating a situation that poses various levels of threat. In Non-Lethal Control Techniques, students are provided the basic skills to arrest a non-compliant suspect without using deadly force. To successfully pass the course, students must score 100 percent in judgment and 70 percent in shooting accuracy. During the first year with ATF, new agents are supposed to complete phase 1 of the training program. The types of training provided to new ATF agents in fiscal year 1995 to introduce them to and train them in the use-of-force and deadly force policies was consistent with the types ofTraining provided to DEA and FBI new agents. Each agency provided new agent trainees with an initial 2-hour classroom lecture and discussion describing with examples the agency’s use- of-force/deadly force policy within the first week of training. In 1994, ATF developed and began requiring an Operational Risk Assessment form to be completed by agents when planning an operation. Factors, such as the suspect’s violent tendencies, the location of the premise, and the amount of fortification expected, also are considered. According to one SRT leader, one specific factor, if present, would not dictate the use of a particular tactic. ATF decided in October 1995 to implement lessons learned from Waco. One change ATF decided to make was that dynamic entry would only be planned after all other options had been considered. ATF training is to emphasize that no one tactic is an absolute and that a number of factors, beyond the agents’ control, will influence whether a dynamic entry or other technique is best. Dynamic entries are to be planned only after all other tactical options have been considered. SRTs are required to receive a minimum of 8 hours training each month, or 24 hours each quarter, in addition to the quarterly firearms training to be received by all ATF agents. This continuing training must be provided by qualified sources, which includes other law enforcement agencies. warrant operations when there is no response to the ATF agents’ knock and announcement. ATF breaching equipment includes items such as one- and two-person battering rams, hydraulic door spreaders, pry bars, and other firemen’s entry tools. Shotgun and explosive breaching has not been authorized by ATF. Agents also can use body bunkers, which are ballistic shields with clear viewports. These bunkers are capable of withstanding direct shots fired from various firearms and provide additional protection to agents. Flash/sound diversionary devices represented the specialized equipment SRTs most frequently trained with and used during deployments. According to agents and several SRT deployment reports, these devices greatly assisted S RTs in subduing suspects, controlling situations, and avoiding shooting incidents. Although SRT members conducted training on rapelling from buildings and aircraft at their initial training and/or fiscal year 1995 in-service training sessions, this tactic was not used during any deployments in 1995, according to the ATF records we reviewed. Two agents breach the door using a ram or other tool to gain entry to the premise. Teams carrying body bunkers then quickly enter and search the premise to locate suspects and clear the premise of any danger. A bunker team generally consists of two or three agents. Additional agents follow the bunker team and handcuff or detain suspects as they are located, and agents located outside the premise provide rear and front security. The Enforcement Support Branch of ATF’s Special Operations Division provides vehicles to ATF divisions for use in enforcement operations. include sedans, vans, and trucks. SRTs may have designated vehicles from which they can deploy during high-risk operations. On the basis of vehicle listings from ATF’s Inventory Tracking and Equipment Management System and our review of all SRT deployments in 1995, vehicles such as large delivery trucks, excess military ambulances, vans and utility trucks have been obtained or donated to ATF for use by S RTs. We observed the Washington, Baltimore, and Los Angeles divisions’ SRT vehicles, which are used to store equipment. ATF obtained five excess military armored “peacekeeper” vehicles from the U.S. Air Force in 1993. One of these vehicles was sent to the SRT training facility at Fort McClellan, and the rest remained at the Enforcement Support Branch in Rockville. ATF decided not to keep these vehicles or obtain others for enforcement operations. At the time of our review, ATF had provided four of these cars to local law enforcement agencies. The remaining vehicle was awaiting disposal.. Vehicles was assigned to field divisions at the time of our review. As of February 1996, ATF had obtained nine excess military fixed-wing twin engine two-seater aircraft for use in enforcement operations. According to ATF policy, the airplanes primarily are intended for use during surveillance operations, such as aerial photography and general area surveys. In only one instance did an SRT use aircraft to transport agents during an operation in fiscal year 1995. In this operation, the SRT was deployed to provide surveillance and possible assistance in the arrest of a suspect in the Oklahoma City bombing investigation. ATF agents’ basic duty uniform for enforcement operations consists of a dark-blue jacket with matching teeshirt, pants, baseball cap, and ballistic vest. Agents are not issued footwear, but may obtain tactical boots for which they are to be reimbursed by ATF. Almost all agents are issued a U.S. Army excess tactical helmet with a detachable, clear plexiglass shield for eye protection. ATF has obtained excess military clothing, such as camouflage battle dress, for use by agents during training. Dynamic entry is a common tactic used by ATF, DEA, and FBI when entry to premises is used to execute high-risk search and arrest warrants. Dynamic entry is to be used when it is believed to be the safest alternative given the particular circumstances and requirements of an operation. ATF has procedures in place for reporting, investigating, and reviewing shooting incidents and use of excessive force allegations involving ATF agents. These procedures are generally comparable to those used by SRTs for dynamic entries. The DEA HEAT team does not train with or have equipment for rappelling. ATF has procedures in place for reporting, investigating, and reviewing shooting incidents. These procedures were revised in October 1994 as part of an overall reorganization of ATF’s operations. ATF investigations determined that all reported intentional shootings were justified and most reported allegations of excessive force were unsubstantiated. ATF also has procedures for addressing administrative tort claims and civil lawsuits filed by complainants. Agents are not required to report shooting incidents related to authorized training and recreational shooting. However, shootings of canines or other animals, while required to be reported, are not normally investigated. DEA and FBI reporting procedures require their agents to immediately report shooting incidents through their chains of command. DEA and FBI field divisions involved in a shooting incident may investigate that incident, while ATF field divisions cannot. ATF also has procedures in place for reporting, investigating, and reviewing use of excessive force allegations. ATF’s OCC is responsible for reviewing administrative tort claims and civil lawsuits filed by complainants. The investigation is to be conducted using the same investigative techniques and techniques as those discussed earlier. guidelines and/or standards recommended by IACP, PCIE, and the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies. IACP and PCIE guidelines and standards respectively for reporting, investigating, and reviewing use of excessive force incidents are the same as those for shooting incidents discussed earlier. ATF procedures designate OI, which reports directly to ATF’s Director, to investigate complaints of misconduct, including use ofcessive force. According to DEA officials, complainants report their allegations either to local law enforcement agencies or to field division SACs. to first conduct an administrative investigation of alleged misconduct by its agents. If the investigation identifies any potential criminal misconduct by an ATF agent, OI is to refer the matter to the appropriate federal, state, and local prosecutor. In addition to reporting use of excessive force allegations to ATF, complainants may also file administrative tort claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) These claims are filed against the United States for allegedly negligent or other wrongful acts committed by its employees, such as ATF special agents. The claim is then to be assigned to an attorney. The attorney is to conduct an initial screening of the claim to determine whether it is filed in a timely manner. If the claim does not contain a sum certain figure or sufficient documentation to support the claimed damages, a letter to the claimant is to be prepared requesting that the claim be denied. The claimant may bring a lawsuit in federal court 6 months after the claim has been filed, or if the claim is denied, the claim can be brought to trial. In shooting incidents, the relevant SIR is to be obtained. In incidents where no investigative report is available, OCC is to request an investigation of the allegations. During fiscal years 1990 through 1995, 975 administrative tort claims were filed against ATF. According to the ACC for litigation, 279 of the 975 claims were approved. If the award involves more than $25,000 and it is approved by the Administrative Programs Division Chief, it must also be approved by Justice. Without Justice’s approval, the letter to the claimant cannot be sent. Of 279 claims, 143 resulted from the Waco incident. About 29 percent could be related to the excessive use of force. 25 of the 55 injury-related tort claims alleged such activity. Of the 55 tort claims resulting from injuries, 4 were granted, 12 were pending at the time of our review, and 39 were denied. tort claims that were granted were for medical costs of an arrestee ($122.46), one was for detention of individuals during a state enforcement action in Waco. which ATF agents participated ($200 for each claimant), one was for the execution of a search warrant at a wrong address ($10,000) Twenty-three of the injury tort claims also resulted in civil lawsuits. Of these, 12 were dismissed, 1 was settled for $20,000 for false arrest, and 10 were pending at the time of our review. If a settlement in excess of $500,000 is recommended, it must be approved by Treasury’s Assistant General Counsel for Enforcement if the lawsuit is against the United States, ATF, or an ATF employee in his/her official capacity. through 1995, 528 civil lawsuits were filed against ATF. According to the ACC for litigation, of the 528 lawsuits, 183 were Bivens and FTCA-related lawsuits. Of the 183 lawsuits, 31 were filed as a result of a shooting or other allegation of excessive force use. Among some of the lawsuit settlements, two were for trespass-type claims, the ACC says. In addition to the lawsuits not related to Waco, 11 were settled with no finding against or concession of wrongdoing. Our review of available information in ATF’s shooting incident and excessive force investigative files for fiscal years 1990 through 1995 showed that ATF complied with its investigative procedures in effect at the time of the investigation. Two investigative files did not contain a record of review required by the procedures. The settlements ranged from $200 for false arrest claims to $250,000 for the accidental shooting of a local law enforcement officer. We did not evaluate the events that resulted in the incidents or the quality and adequacy of the ATF investigations. In 18 of the 25 investigations, the ATF agents involved in the alleged incidents were cleared of all allegations. Four investigations found some type of misconduct by ATF agents. Two investigations were ongoing at the time of our review. One investigation was closed without further action because OI determined that there was no need for adjudication. ATF’s investigations and subsequent reviews determined that most reported use of excessive force allegations were unsubstantiated due to the lack of evidence. In a 1990 incident, a complainant alleged that an ATF agent assaulted him during an arrest for possession of an unregistered firearm. We did not verify whether all shooting and alleged excessive force incidents were reported, or whether all reported allegations of excessive force were investigated. We did a limited check to identify incidents that ATF may not have investigated. Through these sources, eight incidents were identified. We then cross-checked the alleged incidents we identified against ATF’s (a) investigative records to determine if ATF investigated these incidents and (b) litigation records to see if any complainants filed civil lawsuits against ATF related to these incidents. We determined that three of the incidents—one shooting and two excessive force allegations—were investigated by ATF. SIRB is to make formal recommendations about changes in enforcement operations and policies, training, and technology. The heads of the Directorates are responsible for implementing the recommendations and responding to the SIRB in writing. The recommended changes are to reach field agents through their SACs, who are ultimately responsible for their implementation. OI does not have the power to enforce the recommendations, their implementation is to be verified as part of OI’s inspection of ATF’S divisions. SIRB determined that some ATF agents were accidentally discharging their firearms while using body bunkers. SIRB concluded that factors such as wearing gloves and using the off/weak hand may have contributed to the accidental discharges. In response to these recommendations, both the Associate Director for Enforcement and the ATF Director issued separate memorandums to cognizant officials, such as SACs and the Chief of ATF’s National Academy, informing them of the need to improve body bunker and firearms training. In October 1995, ATF issued a report identifying issues arising from the operation at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco. According to ATF officials, they reviewed the Treasury report on the Waco operation and addressed each issue raised in the report. In addition, ATF consulted with experts from other organizations and law enforcement agencies, such as IACP, the National Tactical Officers Association, the FBI, and the Secret Service. copies of the report have been distributed to all ATF field divisions to help implementation. ATF must be prepared to seek assistance from other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies when necessary. Raid commanders must be chosen on the basis of their ability to handle the type of operation involved. Operational security must receive greater attention; in crisis situations, ATF must seek help from other agencies. Raid planners must have training in a wide range of tactical options and must contain carefully constructed contingency plans so that the momentum of going forward does not take control over rational decisionmaking. The incident commander must be located at the command post. ATF is in the process of providing command and control and crisis management training to decisionmakers. ATF determined that the SRTs needed to be better equipped, to be provided with more specialized training, and to have expanded capabilities. ATF personnel, at all times, must be prepared to tell the truth and admit mistakes. If misstatements are made, they must be corrected as quickly as possible, according to the ATF October 1995 report. The ATF Director in October 1994 restructured ATF’s headquarters operations. ATF has procedures in place for reporting, investigating, and reviewing shooting incidents and allegations of excessive force by ATF agents. These procedures are consistent with guidelines and/or standards recommended by IACP, PCIE, and the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies. ATF has implemented lessons learned from shooting investigations, and is in the process of implementing lessons Learned from Treasury’s investigation of the Waco incident, the report says. The report concludes that ATF has complied with its investigative procedures in effect at the time of the investigation.

==================== [58/100] ====================
Summary:
In 2003, oil accounted for about 40 percent of the total U.S. energy consumption. Most oil is used in the transportation sector as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Since 1970, imports of crude oil and other products have increased 255 percent. The United States relies on imported oil for more than half of its supply and appears likely to increase its reliance in the future, the authors say. They say the United States is currently the world’s third largest oil producer, but its proven oil reserves account for less than 1 percent of world demand. Since the 1970s, the crude oil market has, at times, been heavily influenced by the OPEC cartel. OPEC holds about 68 percent of total world oil reserves. Because of the relative political instability in the Middle East, occasional oil supply disruptions and price shocks have been a fact of life for about the past 30 years. Demand has pressed the limits of the production and delivery infrastructure in the oil industry in recent years, says John Defterios, president of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The federal government has supported a number of research and development and regulatory efforts designed to reduce demand for petroleum fuels in transportation. GAO has issued numerous reports on aspects of the petroleum sector, including gasoline markets and government efforts to reduce consumption of gasoline in vehicles among other areas. The U.S. government has encouraged the development and deployment of technologies focused on identifying alternatives to petroleum-based fuels, such as the recent FreedomCAR initiative for fuel-cell technologies for vehicles. The federal government supported the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles to aid automobile manufacturers in developing gas-electric hybrid vehicles. GAO has noted that low gasoline prices do not reflect external costs associated with gasoline use. Low gasoline prices work to discourage energy efficiency and the use of alternative fuels. Later this year, GAO will release a primer on how gasoline is made and distributed, what factors influence the price of gasoline, and why gasoline prices change. In forthcoming work requested by the Congress,GAO will report on the presence of multiple fuel formulation requirements in some parts of the country and how the expansion of these fuels have affected prices. In 2003, coal accounted for about 23 percent of total U.S. energy consumption. Nearly all of the coal consumed in the United States, 92 percent, was used in the production of electricity. Coal reserves are located across the country, with large reserves in the West, the Midwest, and the Appalachian Mountains. In 2003, using EIA data, estimates of recoverable U.s. coal reserves could last over 250 years, based on current usage.for over 100 years. Coal is generally extracted from either surface, or underground mines, but underground coal also contains combustible gas. Coal prices have been declining in real terms since the mid-1970s. The production and use of coal have a variety of environmental consequences. Surface mining has the most significant impacts on land resources. combustion of coal in power plants emits pollutants and contributes to air quality. The federal government controls the amount of federal land an individual company may mine, and requirements that surface land be restored to conditions similar to natural conditions when mining ends. The U.S. Geological Survey says coal reserves are located on federal lands and subject to direct federal controls. GAO: Coal plants emit pollutants such as NOx, sulfur oxides, particulate matter, mercury. In addition to these pollutants, coal plants release a substantial amount of carbon dioxide. GAO: 100 or more power plants featuring advanced technologies are being considered for development in the United States. How can the federal government balance the use of this abundant domestic energy source with its regulated and unregulated environmental consequences, GAO asks in a new report.. What changes in controls, if any, should the U.S. make to how coal can be mined on federal land and elsewhere? What role should the government play in extracting coal bed methane? Natural gas plays a vital role in meeting the country’s national energy demand. Use of natural gas has been growing rapidly since the mid-1980s. The Energy Information Administration estimates that U.S. consumption could increase to about 31 trillion cubic feet (TCF) by 2025. The United States still has substantial undeveloped natural gas resources, but some of these resources are located under federal lands, and access to some of them is restricted, authors say. They ask: What role should the federal government play in providing incentives for using coal in ways that are safer for the environment? 40 percent of the natural gas resources on federal land in the Rocky Mountain region are not available for development. Meeting the sharp increases forecast for natural gas demand could also require substantial increases in infrastructure, such as new pipelines and LNG terminals. To meet the need for sharply higher imports of natural gas, some experts believe that the United States may need to build more LNG Terminals. To date, however, such facilities have not been built due to economic, safety, and security concerns. Consequently, it is not clear whether the U.S. can compete with other countries for these supplies. reports on the natural gas markets and their oversight. In 2002 and 2003, for example, we issued reports analyzing natural gas Markets. GAO will report on federal efforts to understand natural gas market and its role in U.S. energy policy. In forthcoming work requested by the Congress, GAO would report on the federal effort to understand the market and the role of the EIA in overseeing it. The report would also look at various approaches for compensating the federal government when natural gas is removed from federal land and the impacts on certain industries. and manage risks associated with potential terrorist attacks on LNG shipments and other tankers. Should the federal government encourage further development of domestic natural gas on federal lands, and can it ensure that environmental impacts are adequately mitigated? What are the implications for consumers (residential, commercial, industrial, and electric power) of the increasing reliance on natural gas to generate electricity? To what extent is the federalGovernment positioned to ensure that natural gas prices are determined competitively? What role, if any, should the government play in facilitating the development of this infrastructure? Nuclear energy currently accounts for about 8 percent of U.S. national energy consumption. Nearly all nuclear energy is used to generate electricity. The first commercial nuclear power plant came on line in 1957. Whether we can continue to rely on, or expand our use of, nuclear energy in the future at existing plants or at new plants based on new designs hinges on solving the long-term waste storage problem as well as resolving concerns over safety and security, writes John Defterios, a nuclear energy expert. Many nuclear plants operating today were initially licensed for 40 years. No new plants have been ordered in the United States since 1996. Many of the plants that were completed witnessed multibillion dollar cost overruns. The average annual capacity factor has increased from 71 percent in 1997 to 90 percent in 2004. The remaining 104 units have increased their productivity, the output actually increased by about 13 percent from 1998 through 2003. The U.S. nuclear industry has a long way to go, however, to reach its full potential. Interest in nuclear power plants has increased, in part, because they do not emit regulated air pollutants. Nuclear energy plays a large role in supplying energy in France, Germany, Canada, Japan, and other developed nations. Nuclear plants remain very costly to build compared to some other plant types. They have lower fuel and other operating costs and can produce electricity at a lower cost than new plants that use fuels such as coal or natural gas. The U.S. increasingly relies on international markets to obtain the nuclear fuel used here. Efforts to develop the facility have focused on storing the waste deep under Yucca Mountain in the desert north of Las Vegas, Nevada. In 2002, about 45,000 tons of spent fuel from nuclear plants was stored in the United States. Because the permanent repository has not been completed, the highly radioactive waste remains stored at power plants and other facilities and has been the subject of several lawsuits. Nuclear power plants contain radioactive materials that if released could pose catastrophic risks to human health over an expansive area, but are designed and operated to avoid such an event. Since 9/11, nuclear plants have emerged as a key security concern. Industry expects that new plant designs will further reduce safety and security risks. We have issued a series of reports, spanning more than 20 years, that focus on various aspects of developing of a permanent nuclear waste storage facility. In 2002, we reported that it would be premature for DOE to recommend the facility at Yucca Mountain to the President as a suitable repository for nuclear waste. In September 2004, we testified that NRC was generally approving plants’ new security plans on the basis of limited details in the plans. GAO will continue to examine homeland security issues related to protecting commercial nuclear power plants from terrorist attacks. What role should nuclear energy continue to play in providing the nation’s energy needs in view of the aging of existing plants? Are changes needed in how the industry and NRC ensure that plants are operated safely and securely, and is enough being done to protect nuclear plants? GAO will undertake a comprehensive review of NRC”s reactor oversight process and how NRC ensures that plants operate safely. From 1980 through 2003, the quantity of electricity sold increased by 75 percent. In 2003, over 70 percent of electricity was generated using fossil fuels. The federal government has a direct role in supplying electricity, through the federally controlled Power Marketing Agency. In recent years, new power plants have predominantly relied on natural gas, the authors say. and determining whether the federal government can improve how electricity markets function remains a focus for federal policy. and energy policy in the U.S. from terrorist attacks. Electricity sector is restructuring to foster more competition, authors say. But the federal government still oversees wholesale electricity markets, they say. Authors: Consumers should be able to manage their own electricity energy demand. They ask: What changes are necessary to federal and state monitoring and oversight of electricity markets? They also ask: How does continued uncertainty about the future of electricity restructuring affect electricity companies, investment in new plants and transmission lines, and consumer prices? The authors: What role should the federal Power Authority play? In 2003 renewable and alternative energy sources accounted for slightly more than 6 percent of the total U.S. energy consumption. Hydropower is the largest single source in this category and makes up over 45 percent. Several alternative sources, such as hydrogen and fusion power, may offer potential long-term promise, but research remains at an early stage. To what extent are homeland security principles being integrated into new electricity infrastructure and business processes?

Wood accounts for about 34 percent of total renewable energy, although its use has declined since 1989. Alcohol fuels, such as ethanol, make up about 4 percent of the total, but their use has increased rapidly in recent years, almost doubling from 1999 through 2003. Wind energy has witnessed substantial and persistent growth in recently years, more than tripling from 1998 through 2003, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The U.N. estimates that in 2003, there were about 2.5 billion kilowatt-hours of renewable energy consumed. Solar energy accounts for about 1 percent of all renewable and alternative energy consumed. Growth in wind power has benefited from improvements in wind turbine technology. Technologies such as hydrogen power and fusion are currently being developed as new sources of energy. EIA: It is important to keep one eye on the technical goals and one eyes on the marketplace. energy source should be measured by its contribution to increasing the use and feasibility of an energy source, rather than its impact on the environment, EIA says. than reaching specific technical research and development goals. GAO will report on the impact of wind turbines on birds and other aspects of the environment. What should the federal government’s role be in researching and developing existing and future sources of renewable and alternative energy sources? What are the implications of renewable energy mandates for deploying renewable energy technologies and for electricity markets? Experts have long contended that energy strategies that reduce demand can cost less, be brought on line faster, and provide greater environmental benefits, GAO says. Energy demand in the U.S. has trended steadily upward for the last 50 years. While demand has increased, the amount of energy the country uses relative to its economic output has fallen. The reduction has been even more striking when examining the industrial sector, where energy used per dollar of GDP has fallen by over 60 percent since 1970. Despite their advantages, opportunities to improve efficiency and consumer choice are often overlooked, the authors say. It is not clear whether this reduction reflects a reduction in fossil fuel consumption. The federal government has, periodically, made efforts to reduce demand, encourage energy efficiency. Federal efforts have met with some success. Energy efficiency investments made from 1973 through 2003 saved the equivalent of 40 to 50 quadrillion BTUs of energy in 2003. Several organizations, including a panel of several national laboratories, estimate that many opportunities for additional improvements in energy efficiency remain untapped. The U.S. government has also made investments to improve energy efficiency and save money on energy at its own buildings. Reducing demand when prices are falling has been difficult for several reasons. Consumers are often not aware of the energy inefficiency of their homes and businesses. Falling energy prices have also made it more difficult to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of spending money to replace aging and inefficient equipment. In contrast, when consumers face prolonged period of higher energy prices, they are more likely to identify and adopt cost-effective strategies for reducing their energy demand. For example, following prolonged supply disruptions and price increases for gasoline in the 1970s, consumers in the 1980s chose to purchase more fuel-efficient vehicles, pushing up energy prices. GAO has examined policies designed to reduce demand in electricity markets. GAO will evaluate the Department of Energy’s program for setting energy efficiency standards for appliances. Striking a balance between efforts to boost supplies and those focused on reducing demand presents challenges as well as opportunities. Consumer choices made from today forward will determine to a great extent how much energy will be needed in the future, says GAO's John Defterios. The U.S. energy policies come down to choices, he says. the same choices that we are confronting today. How far have we come? Have we charted a course that can be sustained in the 21st century? In 30 years, will we again come full circle and ask ourselves these same questions about our energy future? The answer to this final question lies in our collective ability to develop and sustain a strategic plan, with supporting incentives, along with a means to measure our progress and periodically adjust our path to meet future energy challenges.

The Framework Agreement is the latest achievement in the Doha Development Agenda(DDA) round of trade negotiations at the WTO. Trade ministers set an ambitiousagenda to negotiate an accord by January 1, 2005. The work program devised at Doha folded in continuing talks (the built-in agenda) onagriculture and services. It also launched negotiations on the reduction or elimination of non-agricultural(industrial) tariffs, clarification and improvement of disciplines for existing WTO agreements onantidumping and subsidies. Negotiators looked toward the 5th Ministerial to resolve the modalities. The CancÃºnMinisterial, however, failed to achieve even these expectations. Trade ministers becameembroiled in disputes over agriculture and the Singapore issues. The G-20, an informal group ofdeveloping countries, led by Brazil, India, China, and South Africa, took over the negotiations in September 2003, but failed to reach an agreement on the framework for negotiating the modalitiesto be used in future negotiations. Deadlock over the Singapore issues broke upthe talks before agriculture issues were even formally discussed. U.S. and EU negotiators criticized both the substanceand tactics of the G-20 group. Developing countries defended their actions as representing theirparamount interest in breaking down the agricultural barriers and subsidies in the United States and the EU. The EU'sacceptance of the elimination of agricultural export subsidies "by date certain" alsomoved the negotiations along. Compromise was also achieved over the negotiation of the Singaporeissues. After intense negotiations in late July 2004, WTO members reached what has become known as the Framework Agreement (or the July package) The agreement contains a 4-page declaration, with four annexes (A-D)covering agriculture, non-agricultural market access, services, and trade facilitation. The agreement also abandons the January 1, 2005 deadline for thenegotiations, but instead sets December 2005 as the date for the 6th Ministerial to be held in HongKong. The U.S. has sought expansive tariff liberalization in the non-agricultural market access talks. The United States has also made cross-border trade in services a priority. Previous rounds of trade liberalization were successful in reducing tariffs in the manufacturedgoods sector. That negotiated liberalization has proceeded further in this area perhaps is reflectedin the distribution of world trade. Of the $7.6 of all export subsidies, $1.6 is from the United States, according to the World Trade Organization. Agriculture, though previously negotiated, remains a thorny issue for both producer and consumer,and developed and developing countries. Industrialgoods comprised 71.9%, agriculture 7.6%, and services 20.5%. Trade in services was only broughtunder world trade rules by the Uruguay Round's General Agreement on Trade in Services in 1995. Key provisions in the agriculture framework address trade-distorting domestic support,export competition, market access, cotton subsidies, and other issues. For most U.S. farm groups, the trade-offof most interest is substantial market opening by developing countries in exchange for substantialreductions in domestic support. be subject to deeper cutswith some flexibility for "import-sensitive" products. Developing countries will be able to designate a number of products as "special products,"based on criteria of "food security, livelihood security, and rural development needs" A Special SafeguardMechanism (SSM) will be established for developing countries, while a Special AgriculturalSafeguard (SSG) for developed countries (as currently provided for in the Uruguay RoundAgreement) remains under negotiation. Cotton was not mentioned in the 2001Doha Ministerial Declaration. proposal for zero-for-zero tariffs in oilseedsadvanced earlier by the United States. Disciplines on exportprohibitions and restrictions will be strengthened. Rules on agricultural trade policy monitoring andsurveillance will be enhanced so as to ensure transparency, including "through timely and completenotifications" with respect to commitments in the three pillars. The market effects of global agriculturaltrade liberalization are difficult to estimate at this point in the negotiations because such specifics are still to be negotiated. The harmonizingapproach in the agriculture Framework suggests that others, notably the European Union (EU),would have to cut trade-distorting support more than would the United States. In the EU case, itsbound level of amber box support is currently (depending on exchange rates) around $80 billion while the U.S. bound level is $19 billion. According to U.s. trade negotiators, the United stateslikely should have no difficulty in meeting the aim of cutting the sum of trade- Distorting supportlevels by 20% in the first year. actual spending could be considerably less, rendering the20% cut in the first year meaningless for the United States. Future cuts could be higher, provided that other countries also substantially reduce trade-distorting support and tariffs. Cotton is the only agricultural commodity mentioned by name in theagriculture Framework. U.S. cotton producers object to this singling out of cotton for specialattention. The elimination of EU export subsidies has been a longstanding objective of U.s. agriculturaltrade policy. EU to offer to eliminate them by a date certain. In exchange, however, the EUcountered that all forms of export subsidies, including U.S. export credit guarantees and food aid,should be eliminated. USDA's export credit guarantee programs, which have provided guarantees for about $4 billion of agricultural exports annually in recent years, would be substantially altered by the agreement. U.s. food aid programs which meet the criterion of not displacing commercial sales appear to be unaffected bythe Framework Agreement. grant form" will be addressed in thenegotiations. The role of international organizations vis-a-vis WTO member countries' food aidprograms will also be addressed. Congress would be taking up a new farm bill tosucceed the six-year Food Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-171 ). Farm bill programs that mostlikely would be candidates for change would include commodity price and farm income support. The DDA and the Next Farm Bill. Non-agricultural market access (NAMA) received less scrutiny than agriculture innegotiations for the Framework Agreement. The Framework integrated draft language on NAMA prepared for the CancÃºn Ministerial in September 2003. Developed nations sought to include the language wholesale, yet developing countries resisted. They insisted on a paragraph, included in thefirst paragraph of the text, indicating that "additional negotiations are required to reach agreementon the specifics of some of these elements" The elements being the formula, treatment of unboundtariffs, flexibilities for developing countries. Doha round,trade of industrial and primary products, the subject of the NAMA negotiations, continue to makeup the bulk of world trade. The outcome ofthese negotiations could have a substantial impact on U.S. trade patterns and on the world economy. The Framework Agreementendorsed the use of a non-linear formula applied on a line-by-line basis as a modality to conduct tariff reduction negotiations. Under the Framework Agreement, tariff reductions would be calculated from the bound,rather than the applied, level. tariff is set as a percentage of the value of an imported good, while a non- ad valorem tariffuses some other measurement such as a fixed rate per unit or weight of goods. While non-ad valorem tariffs are more prevalent in agriculture, they continue to be employed for non-agricultural tariffs andare not solely a developing country phenomenon. A recent study calculated that 4.2% of lines in theUnited States tariff schedule remained non ad-valorem and for Switzerland the figure was 82.8percent. services is only mentionedbriefly in the WTO negotiating framework. Authors of initial drafts of theFramework had lumped services trade in with "other issues" "Services" refers to a broad range ofeconomic activities, essentially any economic activity that is not a tangible good. Services account for a major and growing portion of the U.S. economy and for a good portionof the rest of the world economies. In 2003, services accounted for about 58% of U.s. GrossDomestic Product (GDP) In 2003, services accounted for 30.1% of U.S. exports of goods and services. Services are bought and sold via four means or "modes": (1) cross-border trade; (2)consumption abroad where the consumer physically travels to another country to buy the service; (3)commercial presence where the service is provided by a firm in one country via its branch, agency,or wholly-owned subsidiary located in the country of the buyer; and (4) Multilateral rules on trade in services are very new and were established under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) They are administered by the World Trade Organization(WTO) which wasestablished on January 1, 1995 also as part of the Uruguay Round. The GATS contains basicprinciples and rules ontrade in services, some of which, for example, national treatment andmost-favored-nation treatment, are parallel to long-established rules for trade in goods under theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. part of the so-called WTO "built-in agenda" It wasagreed before the Doha Ministerial that services negotiations would operate in a request-offer format. The negotiations onservices were folded into the agenda of the new round at the November 2001 WTO Ministerial in Doha, Qatar. EachWTO member first indicates what general concessions they request from the other members and then, separately, each member indicates what concessions it is willing to offer. (26) Doha Round Negotiations. in services and, by March 31, 2003, shouldsubmit their offerings of what their initial commitments would be toward liberalizing trade inservices in their economies. The United States had completed its requests for commitments from other member countries on July 1, 2002. The U.S. requests call for many of the countries to improve transparency inregulations of services to boost efficiency across all services industries. (27) Other countries, including the 15 members of the EU, submitted their own requests, including requests made of the United States to reduce trade barriers in services. Developing countries were reluctant to make offers on services until they saw how far some of thedeveloped countries were willing to go on agriculture. Because the Framework Agreementaddressed many agricultural trade issues, supporters of liberalized trade in services are anticipatingthat the services negotiations will gain momentum. The Framework itselfmentions services only briefly because they were not the focus of the negotiations over theframework and the parameters had already been established as part of the "built-inagenda" and in the Doha Ministerial Declaration that launched the new round. as possible, to submit revised offers by May 2005and to ensure that the offers are of high quality. The negotiating Framework notes the particular interest that developing countries have inissues pertaining to mode-4 supply of services. In many member countries, services are a large portion of economic activity. Yet, servicesaccount for only a small portion of total trade, indicating many untapped opportunities for trade inservices. For many countries, especially developing countries,liberalization in services trade is a very sensitive issue that may make achieving the opportunitiesdifficult if not elusive. of international trade through strengtheningtrade rules concerning customs procedures. In the modern "just in time" economy, where traders rely on quick turnaround andshipping to meet orders, this poses a significant problem. According to the United NationsConference on Trade and Development, the average customs transaction involves 20-30different parties, 40 documents, 200 data elements (30 of which are repeated 30 times), and there-keying of 60-70% of all data at least once. WTO negotiations on trade facilitation seek to improve trade procedures by utilizing technology more effectively. enhancing cooperation among customs and other officials, reducingdocumentation requirements and other administrative burdens, and ensuring a fair and transparentsystem of administering trade. Trade facilitation has the potential to reduce the cost of trade,increase opportunities for trade, diminish corruption associated with customs procedures, increasecompliance with customs rules. Reducing the costsof trade with developing countries could help U.S. businesses establish new export markets andlower-cost suppliers. The United States may also benefit from trade facilitation in the same way as other countries. The United States has worked with other WTO members toward launching trade facilitationnegotiations. The negotiations are to consider the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries. The existing WTO rules singled out for attention are Articles V, VIII, and X of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) The Framework recognizes that a negotiated agreement mayrequire some members to further develop their infrastructure, and this may be burdensome for somedeveloping countries. However, developed countries are expected to make every effort to ensuresupport and assistance for implementing the commitments. it does not receive adequatesupport from developed member countries. Much work remains to be done to flesh out the Framework to an actual agreement ontrade liberalization. Agreement to reduce domestic support according to aharmonizing formula represents substantial progress, but difficult negotiations are expected over specifics. In turn, the manner by which these issues are resolved may influence the level ofCongressional support for any resulting agreement. For the Doha negotiations to succeed, however, these issues must be addressedand resolved. such as thepercentage cuts in overall support and in specific categories of trade distorting support (amber box,newly-defined blue box, and de minimis ). Similarly, the EU's concession on eliminating export subsidies is supposed tobe matched with U.S. cuts in export credit guarantees and food aid programs. Resolving this trade-off is critical to bothrealizing market benefits from further agricultural trade liberalization as well as gaining eventualsupport in Congress for a WTO trade agreement.  mode-4 delivery of services will likely be an issue of critical interest to some members of Congress. Mode-4 is the most critical issue for a number of largedeveloping countries, including India and China. Members were stronglycritical of trade agreements that included provisions affecting U.S. immigration policy, and vowed to oppose future agreements that did so. The NAMA language wasreplicated from the 2003 CancÃºn text, but language inserted at the insistence of the developing countriescasts doubt on the finality of these decisions. The success of the NAMA negotiations may also depend on cooperation of developing countries. Developing countries may prove more likely to engage in the talks if they are confident that they will not be forced to take measures beyond their capacity. In establishing talks on trade facilitation, membercountries may first reach an agreement on whether to negotiate new rules, or merely guidelines, fortrade facilitation. This may be accomplished by first reaching agreement on concrete steps for theprovision of technical assistance, and the application of special and differential treatment.

Summary:
The United States and the UK are two of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. The UK is also the sixth-largest economy in the world and a major financial center. U.S. and UK officials, from the Cabinet level down, consult frequently and extensively on many global issues. Some observers assert that a common language and cultural similarities, as well as the habits of British people, may play a role in the relationship between the two countries. The two countries share an extensive and mutually beneficial trade and economic relationship. The UK is led by Prime Minister Theresa May of the Conservative Party. She became prime minister in July 2016, after David Cameron resigned in the wake of leading the unsuccessful campaign for the UK to remain in the European Union. As the longest-serving home secretary in modern times, May oversaw the UK's counterterrorism, policing, crime, and immigration policies from 2010 to 2016. The special relationship also encompasses close intelligence-sharing arrangements and unique cooperation in nuclear and defense matters. The term special relationship has often been used to describe the high degree of mutual trust between the two countries. The UK election of June 8, 2017, resulted in a hung parliament. No single party won a majority of seats in the 650-seat House of Commons. With 318 seats, the Conservative Party came in first place but lost the majority it had in the 2015 election. The Labour Party outperformed most expectations by winning 262 seats, a gain of 30. It was not what Prime Minister May had in mind in April 2017 when she unexpectedly announced a snap election shortly after opening the two-year window for negotiating the exit from the EU. May was able to form a Conservative minority government after concluding a deal for support from the Democratic Unionist Party. Since 2007, the DUP has led Northern Ireland's devolved regional government in a power-sharing arrangement with Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein. The Conservatives granted the DUP more budgetary resources for Northern Ireland as a key part of the two parties' parliamentary support deal. Other notable outcomes from the June 2017 election included the following: After gaining 50 seats in the 2015 election, the Scottish National Party (SNP) suffered the loss of 21 seats. Nearly 52% of British voters in the June 2016 referendum on EU membership answered that the UK should leave the EU. Factors such as economic dissatisfaction, unease with globalization and immigration, and antielite or antiestablishment sentiments played key roles in the referendum outcome. The vote was the culmination of a decades-long debate in the UK about the country's EU membership. Fearing a loss of national sovereignty and influence, the UK stood aside in the 1950s when the six founding countries launched the first steps of European integration. The relationship between London and Brussels often has been marked by ambivalence. The UK "opted out" of several major elements of European integration, such as the euro currency and the passport-free Schengen Area. British "euro-skeptics" have frequently expressed frustration that the EU tends to focus too much on internal treaties and process. With the clock ticking on a presumed exit in March 2019, Prime Minister May has sought to manage an intense debate about what Brexit should look. The UK government opted for a "hard Brexit," meaning a full departure from the EU single market and customs union. The strategy indicated that the UK would attempt to negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU to secure as much access to the EU market as possible. Emboldened by the result of the June 2017 election, however, advocates of a "soft Brexit" strategy have continued to urge the UK retain at least some elements of membership in the EUSingle market and agree to a multiyear transition period.  Divisions over differing viewpoints toward Brexit run through Parliament and the British public, but also through the Conservative Party and Prime Minister May's Cabinet. With her leadership weakened after the June 2017 election, many observers question how PM May can deliver a Brexit deal that satisfies both viewpoints. The tasks of managing Brexit-related tensions and disagreements within her own party, heading off rebellions from one side or the other, and finding potential areas of compromise are likely to be central challenges for the Prime Minister and her Cabinet. In December 2017, the government suffered a defeat when Parliament voted (309-305, with 11 Conservative MPs defecting) in favor of an amendment to the government's EU Withdrawal Bill. The government had promised a "meaningful vote" in Parliament on the withdrawal agreement, but some MPs feared the bill's language allowed ministers too much power to implement statutory changes without parliamentary approval. The country's National Health Services (NHS) have been severely strained by a capacity crisis during the winter of 2017-2018, pressuring the prime minister. the government to make plans for increasing resources and improving the performance of the UK's health sector. The Conservative Party also faces growing calls for a new definition of what it stands for in order to counter voters' receptiveness to the antiausterity messages of Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party. On March 29, 2017, Prime Minister May invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. The UK named as its lead negotiator David Davis, holding the newly created position of Secretary of State for Exiting the EU. The European Commission (the EU's executive institution) serves as the EU's negotiator. The EU's negotiating guidelines adopted at the leaders' summit in Brussels in April 2017 presented a two-phase approach to the talks. The EU resisted opening negotiations on its future economic and trade relationship with the UK until at least some of the main terms of withdrawal had been agreed. After seven months and six rounds of discussions, the two sides reached an agreement in principle covering main aspects of the three priority topics. The European Commission released the text of its draft withdrawal agreement on February 28, 2018. UK initially proposed that EU free movement rights would not carry over after withdrawal. EU citizens resident in the UK at the time of withdrawal would need to apply for a new immigration status. The outcome reflected in the December joint report was much closer to the original EU position. Citizens' advocacy groups assert that a lack of clarity remains about many questions, including whether and how individuals will need to register in order to qualify or claim their rights. The "divorce bill" quickly became one of the most contentious subjects of the negotiations. Sources in the EU suggest a figure as high as €100 billion (approximately $124 billion) Although it does not specify a figure, the agreement set out in the December joint report suggests that the total cost to the UK is likely to be about €40-€45 billion. The agreement includes the UK's share of implementing the EU's budget through the end of 2020 (the EU's current budget framework covers 2014-2020) Although the exact schedule and methodology remains to be detailed, costs are to be paid in euros and as they fall due. The border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland has become a complicated sticking point in the Brexit negotiations. Some observers initially expressed concerns that the reestablishment of a harder border could harm Northern Ireland's economy and destabilize the peace process. All parties have been eager to avoid such an outcome, and have sought to negotiate a special arrangement for Northern Ireland. The UK commits to avoiding a hard border, including the establishment of physical infrastructure for checks or controls, and to protecting North-South cooperation. Prime minister called for a custom tailored economic relationship with the EU. She additionally spoke of a border that is as "frictionless as possible" No new tariffs or quotas, and a "comprehensive system of mutual recognition" in terms of regulatory standards. The UK would also be able to apply its own tariffs and trade policy for goods intended for the UK market, she said. She asserted that every Free Trade Agreement has varying market access depending on the respective interests of the countries involved. Prime minister also called for a new independent arbitration mechanism, not the ECJ, to resolve disputes. Draft guidelines indicated that with the UK out of the single market and customs union, the EU considers such an ambitious trade and economic relationship as unrealistic. EU leaders are expected to adopt formal negotiating guidelines for phase two at a summit on March 22, 2018. The draft suggested the possibility of a free trade agreement that avoids tariffs and quotas but has only limited coverage of services (including financial services) and less potential for regulatory cooperation and mutual recognition of standards. agreement and transition arrangements. Examples of such issues include transition arrangements for the UK's exit from free trade agreements with both the EU itself and with third countries. The negotiations also are expected to address issues related to security cooperation, including judicial and law enforcement cooperation. The remaining 27 member states will decide where to resettle the two EU agencies located in the UK. (The agencies are the European Arrest Warrant and the European Court of Justice.) The negotiations are also expected to seek arrangements facilitating the transfer of information-sharing databases. The withdrawal agreement must be approved by both sides. In the UK, both Houses of Parliament (Commons and Lords) will vote on whether to accept the withdrawal agreement as negotiated or move ahead with no deal. The UK is likely to remain subject to EU rules governing trade policy and the single market without having voting representation in the EU institutions that shape those rules. Some observers suggest that given the pace and dynamics of the negotiations thus far, there is a possibility of a "no deal" scenario for March 2019. convert all EU law into UK law to prevent a legal "black hole" following the UK's departure from the EU. The UK would then decide on its own timetable what parts of EU law to keep or change going forward. Many economists have expressed concerns that Brexit could cause an economic shock that leaves the UK facing weaker economic growth, higher inflation, job losses, and depreciation of the pound. Advocates of Brexit have maintained that such economic fears are greatly exaggerated. The uncertainty has led some large companies to make plans, or to consider making plans, for moving their EU base, along with attendant jobs and capital, elsewhere. World's financial firms basing their European headquarters in London and employing 1 million people, is the loss of the UK's EU "passporting" rights. The signature initiative of the Conservative-led coalition government that took office in 2010 was a far-reaching austerity program aiming to reduce the country's budget deficit. Between 1993 and 2008, the British economy enjoyed an unprecedented period of sustained growth. The country was severely impacted by the global financial crisis and entered a deep recession in 2008, and a prolonged slump lasted until 2012. budget deficit as spending outpaced tax revenues and growth. The government budget deficit grew from 5% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2008 to nearly 11% in 2009. In response to these trends, the coalition government began a program of budget austerity. Supporters have praised the austerity strategy as necessary to put the UK back on the path of financial sustainability. Opponents have argued that the government's approach is ideologically driven, unduly targets the poor, and is unfair to the poor. The UK's "special relationship" with the United States has been a cornerstone of British foreign policy since the 1940s. The UK is often perceived to be the leading allied voice in shaping U.S. foreign policy debates. British support, in turn, has often helped add international credibility and weight to U.N. policies and initiatives, and the U.K. is a key ally of the European Union, the European Council and the European Court of Human Rights, among others. The British government's most recent budget moderately loosened fiscal policy, with more spending to support the NHS. The UK continues to look to the United States for close partnership. President Trump appears to have a largely positive view of the UK as well. But there have been points of tension and uncertainty in the relationship over the past year. Some Members of Congress also have backed negotiating a free trade agreement with the UK. The UK cannot formally negotiate trade agreements until it leaves the EU, but some suggest that positive indications of a likely future agreement could help bolster the UK's position in negotiations with the EU on the terms of Brexit. Prime Minister May has consistently sought to convey that the alliance remains central to European security and the deterrence of Russian aggression. In contrast, President Trump has expressed opposition to the Iran nuclear deal and announced the planned U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. May disagreed with the Trump Administration's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, calling the move "unhelpful in terms of prospects for peace in the region" She also expressed "deep concern" about the President's plan announced in March 2018 to introduce tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Many in the UK have criticized Prime Minister May's outreach to the Trump Administration. Several incidents during President Trump's first year in office generated a backlash. In November 2017, President Trump was rebuked by PM May and numerous other British politicians for retweeting anti-Muslim videos posted by a far-right British group. President Trump initially pushed back against May's criticism, but he later offered to apologize. A date for PresidentTrump's state visit has not been officially set, leading to considerable uncertainty. In January 2018, President Trump canceled a planned working visit in February 2018 to open the new $1.2 billion U.S. embassy in London. Later in the month, he indicated that he planned to visit the UK at least once in 2018, with the official state visit potentially taking place in October 2018. The cancellation of the February working visit led some observers, including UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, to express concerns that opposition to Trump in the UK was endangering the U-S.-UK relationship. U.S. defense planners have long viewed the UK as one of the most capable European allies. Observers note that the United States and the UK have long tended to have similar outlooks on issues such as the use of force. UK leaders have emphasized their continued commitment as a leading country in NATO. The UK has taken a strong role in efforts to deter Russian aggression, the U.S.-led coalition has said. the UK hosts about 8,700 American military personnel. During 2017, the UK was the lead nation in NATO's Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) U.S. personnel would pull out of three leased UK airbases and move to other locations in the UK and Germany. Full U.S divestment from these bases, originally planned for 2022, might not occur until 2024. Facilities of the Joint Intelligence Analysis Complex are being relocated from Molesworth and consolidated in a new Joint intelligence analysis center at RAF Croughton. The U.s. Air Force plans to increase personnel at RAF Lakenheath, which is home to an F-15 fighter wing and home to two squadrons of F-35s. The United States and the United Kingdom are key partners in terms of defense industry cooperation and defense sales. The two countries are engaged in more than 20 joint equipment programs, including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Most major U.S. defense companies have a UK presence; numerous British companies, most notably BAE Systems, operate in the United States. In 2007, in an effort to address long-standing British concerns about technology-sharing restrictions, the countries signed a Treaty Concerning Defense Trade Cooperation. In 2016, the UK had the world's fifth-largest military expenditure, spending approximately $52.5 billion. The UK is one of the few NATO countries to meet the alliance's defense spending benchmark of 2% of GDP. As part of the government's broad austerity program, UK defense spending decreased 8% in real terms over the period 2011-2015. Experts assert that the cuts, combined with other associated decisions, reduced the UK's conventional military combat capability by 20% to 30%. The UK has been focusing on areas such as special forces, intelligence, counterterrorism, and cybersecurity. In October 2016, the UK launched a new National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) within the GCHQ. The NCSC absorbed and replaced four previous government cybersecurity units, bringing together their expertise in a single point of contact for the public and private sector. The agency provides advice, consulting services, and incident response and recovery services. It works with law enforcement, intelligence and security agencies, and international partners. Between March and June 2017, there were three terrorist incidents in the UK claimed by the Islamic State group. With these attacks perpetrated by British citizens, the group's capacity to direct or inspire attacks in Europe has become a top concern. Experts have estimated that approximately 760 people have traveled from the UK to train or fight in Syria and Iraq and that at least 350 such individuals have returned home. The UK adopted a new Counter-Terrorism and Security Act in 2015 that enhanced the country's already relatively extensive body of counterterrorism legislation. Most analysts and officials agree that U.S.-UK intelligence and counterterrorism cooperation is close, well established, and mutually beneficial. The relationship was damaged by public accusations of British complicity in U.s.-led renditions and the alleged torture of terrorist suspects between 2002 and 2008. There have been occasional tensions. Under the Tempora program, which has.to confiscate the passports of terrorism suspects, UK officials have called on internet and technology companies to do more to remove terrorism content from their sites. not been acknowledged by GCHQ, the UK reportedly has tapped into undersea transatlantic fiber-optic cables that carry international telephone and internet traffic. Media reports have suggested that the NSA and GCHQ worked together on at least some aspects of collection operations. This episode raised considerable concerns among UK civil liberty and privacy groups. The U.S.-UK bilateral investment relationship is the largest in the world. In 2016 (latest complete data available), U.s. foreign direct investment (FDI) in the UK was $682.4 billion. U.S. FDI flows to the UK reportedly decreased 50% over the first nine months of 2017, compared to the same period of 2016. The UK is the United States' seventh-largest trading partner. Analysts believe that close U.S.-UK cooperation will continue for the foreseeable future in areas such as counterterrorism, intelligence, economic issues, and the future of NATO. Some officials have conveyed concerns that the UK's withdrawal could make the EU a less important partner. But the UK is expected to remain a key U.s. partner in operations to combat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The UK is a leading voice for robust EU sanctions against Russia due to its actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Some observers suggest the departure of the UK could shift the debate in the EU about the duration and severity of the sanctions. The UK has irritated some of its EU partners by essentially vetoing initiatives to develop a stronger CSDP, arguing that such efforts duplicate and compete with NATO. In 2011, for example, the UK blocked a proposal to consolidate the command structure for EU military missions under a single permanent operational headquarters. U.S. officials generally have supported EU initiatives aimed at increasing European defense capabilities. They continue to urge that such efforts remain complementary to NATO and do not duplicate or compete with NATO activities. Some observers note that Brexit pushes Europe back toward another prolonged bout of internal preoccupation, consuming a considerable degree of UK and EU time and personnel resources in the process. The EU should concentrate more effort and resources toward addressing a wide range of shared external challenges (such as terrorism and instability to Europe's south and east), they say.

Summary:
Recognizing the human capital challenges facing federal agencies, Congress, the administration, and others are focusing increased attention on strategic human capital management. Congress has underscored the consequences of human capital weaknesses in federal agencies. The President, in August 2001, placed human capital at the top of his management agenda. The Office of Management and Budget is assessing agencies’ progress in addressing their individual human capital problems. The federal government needs to adopt a consistent strategic approach to marshaling, managing, and protecting human capital. The 8th Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation, completed in 1997, strongly advocated that DOD adopt a strategic human capital planning approach. DOD and service studies, including those by the Defense Science Board Task Force on Human Resources Strategy, endorsed the concept of human capital strategic planning. In April 2002, DOD also published A New Social Compact: A Reciprocal Partnership Between the Department of Defense, Service Members and Families. The two plans constitute a positive step forward in DOD’s strategic management of the military workforce. are working to improve the integration of the human capital plans by developing an “umbrella’ plan. High-performing organizations use relevant and reliable data to determine key performance objectives and goals that enable them to evaluate the success of their human capital approaches. The military personnel strategic plan provides measures of effectiveness for each initiative, but these measures are not adequate to assess the effectiveness of a human capital approach, the authors say. They say a fact-based, performance-oriented approach is crucial for maximizing the value of human capital. DOD has faced challenges in providing benefits to service members that respond to their changing needs. A major demographic change has been the growing proportion of service members who are women. In 2000, women comprised about 15 percent of the active duty force, compared with 4 percent in 1974. Up to 10 percent of women in the military become pregnant each year. If these trends continue, DOD may need to take into account the benefits that this population values to better retain these trained, experienced service members, authors say. written statement of the actions taken on our recommendations to the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs.

Summary:
The Railroad Retirement Act authorizes retirement, survivor, and disability benefits for railroad workers and their families. The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB), an independent federal agency, administers these benefits. Workers covered by the RRB include those employed by railroads engaged in interstate commerce and related subsidiaries, railroad associations, and railroad labor organizations. These benefits are earned by railroad workers in lieu of Social Security. The Tier I railroad retirement benefit that is equivalent to Social Security benefits is mainly finance by Tier I payroll taxes and Social Security's financial interchange transfers. Under the RRSIA, Tier II taxes on both employers and employees are automatically adjusted according to the average account benefits ratio. The ABR is the ratio of the combined fair market value of Railroad Retirement Account and Trust assets as of the close of the fiscal year to the total RRB benefits and administrative expenses paid. A higher average ABR will result in a lower Tier II tax rate and consequently lower future tax income, whereas a lower ABR result in higher Tier IITax rates and higher tax income. income. Depending on the average ABR, Tier II taxes for employers can range between 8.2% and 22.1% and the Tier II tax rate for employees is capped at 4.9%. Since the Trust's inception,Tier II tax rates have been lowered twice and increased twice (see Figure 1 ). In 2013, tax rates were raised to 12.6% and 4.4% on employers and employees, respectively. The maximum amount of earnings subject toTier II taxes is $98,700 in 2019. The Trust is an independent nongovernmental entity, and it is not subject to the same oversight as federal agencies. Outside investment managers hired by the Trust invest the assets according to these guidelines. The resulting investment performance is monitored by the trustees and the Trust's Chief Investment Officer. The Trust's target asset allocations change over time to reflect current market expectation (see Figure 2 ). For example, the Trust has continued its effort in moving away from fixed income investment, with a decline from 35 % of total investments in FY2006 to 20% in FY2017. and administrative control systems, and any other information necessary to inform Congress about the operations and financial condition of the Trust. The financial statements must be audited by independent public accountants. A copy of the annual report and audit must be submitted to the President, the RRB, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) The RRB has the authority to bring a civil action to enforce provisions of the act. In 2008, the OIG argued that the annual financial audit required "is not adequate to support theRRB's enforcement responsibility" than there are for the retirement investments of federal government and private-sector workers. For example, there is no requirement for performance audits of the Trust, which would assess program effectiveness, economy and efficiency, internal control, and compliance with the law. The lack of NRRIT investment fund management accountability, transparency, and stringent financial oversight can be precursors to fraud, waste and abuse, according to the OIG. The OIG asserted that lack of access to the Trust's auditor continued to be a problem in FY2018. be a concern, This lack of cooperation and communication prevents OIG auditors from obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the RRB's financial statements. As required in the RRSIA, Trust purchases and sales initially were treated as exchanges of assets of equal value. The law did not prescribe the treatment of unrealized capital gains and losses on the Trust's investments. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and OMB agreed that any capital loss or gain resulting from changes in market prices would be recognized in the year in which the price change occurs. From FY2003 to FY2017, the Trust's annual rates of return, net of fees, have averaged 8.3%. The Trust's administrative expenses steadily increased through FY2011 as its investment portfolio diversified. Beginning in FY2012, the trust's administrative expense ratio decreased, mirroring a national trend of decreasing expense ratios for mutual and money market funds. In FY 2017, thetrust's rate of return of 13.4% (net of fees) exceeded the benchmark of 12.3% points for equity funds, 48 basis points for bond funds, 70 basis point for hybrid funds, and 25 basis pointsFor money market funds, points for equity and bond funds are 48 and 70 basis points, respectively. For money market and hybrid funds respectively, points are 25 and 48, respectively, for Equity and Bond funds, Equity and Hybrid Funds, Hybrid Funds and Money Market Funds.

Summary:
The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (NDAA) directed DOD to establish centers of excellence for traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. Senior-level DOD officials convened representatives from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Department of Veterans Affairs to determine how to establish the centers. Informally, this group was known as the “Red Cell’ and its primary mission was to address recommendations related to PH and TBI. According to one representative, the Red Cell also debated whether to establish a combined center for both TBI and PH. The military services, TMA, and DCOE receive PH and TBI funding through the Defense Health Program (DHP) appropriation account. The Army received the largest portion of funds, about $279 million or 44 percent, while DCOE received approximately $168 million or 26 percent. In fiscal year 2010 a total of $638 million in DHP operations and maintenance funding was allotted for PH, TBI across the military services. Of all PH andTBI funding allotted, $96 million or 15 percent was suballoted to component centers within the DCOE network. DOD budget formulation occurs in the programming phase of the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution Process. DCOE had a limited role in budget decision making for the fiscal year 2012 POM process. Ultimately, senior DOD officials decided to fund 1 of 18 PH and TBI requests, which did not include DCOE’s. For this POM, DCOE headquarters solicited and received budget requests from component centers.. The relationship between component centers and DCOE and the missions of two component centers, T2 and the National Intrepid Center of Excellence (NICOE), were unclear. Congressional hearing expressed differing visions of DCOE’s mission. Members voiced concern about the amount of time needed to establish DCOE and achieve results. DCOE is a relatively small entity and it does not typically appear in DOD DHP budget presentation materials. While PH and TBI information is reported to congressional decision makers, DCOE specific funding and activities are not visible. The Government Performance Results Act (GPRA) Modernization Act of 2010 further requires agencies to consult with the congressional committees that receive their plans. The committee provided a draft of this report to the Secretary of the Department of Defense for official review and comment. The Assistant Secretary of Defense of Health Affairs and Director of TRICARE Management Activity provided us with written comments, which are summarized below and reprinted in appendix III. DOD concurred with all of our recommendations. DOD stated that DCOE is appropriately informed of budget execution data through formal systems, as well as informal coordination and managerial reporting. The data provided for fiscal year 2010 remain incomplete and the information provided has not been sufficient to confirm its accuracy or reliability. unable to describe the process used to identify and resolve errors in source data from multiple financial systems. TMA stated that it could not confirm the accuracy of data from financial systems it does not administrate. This raises questions about DCOE and TMA’s oversight and use of these data to inform budget formulation. DOD agreed with the recommendation to expand its review and analysis process to include component centers. But it did not plan to include two component centers, the Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress and the Centre for Deployment Psychology. of DCOE, DOD appropriations acts from fiscal years 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010, and accompanying committee reports. We reviewed DCOE’s mission, strategic goals, and performance measures. We interviewed officials at Health Affairs, Force Health, Protection and Readiness, and the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences. We conducted this performance audit from June 2010 through June 2011 in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act on PH conditions and TBI. The Defense Health Program appropriation includes three accounts, Operations and Maintenance, Procurement, and Research, Development, Test and Evaluation. Six directorates carry out activities related to psychological health conditions and traumatic brain injury. GAO: Evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. DOD was not readily able to provide us with basic information on funding and obligations. The data provided for fiscal year 2010 remain incomplete and the information provided has not been sufficient to confirm its accuracy and reliability. Accurate and reliable status of funding data should be used as the starting point to inform, justify, and prioritize future budget requests. common understanding of budget terminology, such as allotments and obligations. DOD provided numerous revisions to data provided after February 15, 2011, and continued to do so even in comments to the draft of this report. DOD was unable to describe the process used to identify and resolve errors in source data from multiple financial systems, and TMA stated that it could not confirm the accuracy of data from financial systems it does not administrate. In addition to the individual listed above, Carol M. Henn, Assistant Director; Erinn L. Sauer; Michael Aksman; Alexandra Edwards; Robert Gebhart; Jyoti Gupta; Chelsa Gurkin; Felicia Lopez; and Steven Putansu made major contributions to thisReport.

Summary:
In the United States, although drugs are classified as prescription or nonprescription, the practice of pharmacy is typically regulated by states. The 1951 Durham-Humphrey Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act provided the statutory basis for the two-tier drug classification system. Drugs in the BTC class would be those determined by FDA to be nonprescribed but would require the intervention of a pharmacist. The BTC idea that FDA sought comment on would require that these drugs be sold only in pharmacies, and that a pharmacists’ intervention with a consumer occur before the drug could be dispensed. FDA has not indicated which drugs might be classified as BTC in the United States. Among the drugs suggested by some proponents are certain drugs that treat chronic conditions such as high cholesterol, asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes, urinary incontinence, and osteoporosis. Vaccines; the epinephrine auto-injector used in emergency situations following insect bites, stings, or exposure to other allergens; and oseltamivir—which is used to treat influenza and might be effective in the event of an influenza pandemic. Nonprescription drugs in the United States generally have these characteristics: (1) their benefits outweigh their risks; (2) consumers can use them for self-diagnosed conditions; and (3) they can be adequately labeled. Proponents of a BTC drug class argue that such a class would increase access because drugs that might not otherwise be suitable for general OTC use could be available without a prescription. Many of the drugs that could be switched to OTC under the current two-tier drug classification system have already been reclassified. To implement a BTC drug class, it would be important to evaluate whether a sufficient pharmacist workforce would be available. It would also be necessary to determine whether all pharmacists and pharmacy staff would be required to be trained in BTC-related skills. Having an inadequate number of pharmacists willing to carry out BTC functions could reduce the value of such a class. Consumers would need to understand protocols for obtaining BTC drugs, such as the necessity of consulting with a pharmacist before obtaining a drug. If a BTC class is established in the United States, consumers might need time to adjust to the new role. Cost-related issues would be important for the establishment of a BTC drug class. Third-party coverage of BTC drugs could affect consumers’ out-of-pocket drug expenses. Cost of nonreimbursable BTC drugs may also affect the extent to which consumers use BTC drugs. Compensation for BTC services might be necessary to offset increased costs incurred by pharmacists as a result of their BTC counseling, experts say.. The American Pharmacists Association has raised concerns about whether it would be financially feasible for pharmacies to carry BTC drugs unless pharmacists were able to bill. Concerns about liability might deter pharmacists from dispensing BTC drugs. Costs might be affected by new incentives to encourage drug manufacturers to invest funds in a two-stage switch process. Drug manufacturers may receive 3 additional years of exclusive marketing rights for drugs switched from prescription to OTC status if the switch requires additional clinical trials. HHS agreed that cost-related issues would have to be addressed before implementing a BTC drug class.. HHS suggested that GAO add a discussion regarding the statutory authority to provide reimbursement under Medicare Part D for drugs that would be included in a BTC. In light of the November 2007 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) public meeting to explore the public health implications of behind-the-counter (BTC) availability of certain drugs, we are updating information we first presented in our 1995 report. To describe the arguments that have been made supporting and opposing a BTC drug class in the United States, we reviewed published literature, reports, and meeting minutes of FDA hearings. To determine the impact of restricted nonprescription drug classes on drug availability, we interviewed experts. Drug classification system in the Netherlands includes four categories: pharmacy only, pharmacy and drugstore, and general sale. Drugs can be switched from prescription to more restrictive classification on rare occasions for safety reasons. The pharmacy class is reserved for drugs requiring interaction with pharmacy staff although not necessarily a pharmacist. The drugstore class is the default class for all nonprescription drugs that do not meet the criteria for pharmacy or OTC sale. The distinction between drugstore and OTC classification is often based on the dosage or pack size. The United Kingdom continues to use the three-tier drug classification system that was in place in 1995. Prescription drugs can be dispensed only with written or oral orders (i.e., a prescription) Nonprescription drugs are often referred to in the United States as OTC drugs. About 60 percent of EU countries do not have an OTC drug class, according to pharmacy experts. The European Medicines Agency makes a recommendation on whether the new drug should receive prescription or nonprescription status. neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases; and orphan drugs. Most drugs currently on the market in the EU were originally approved through national authorization procedures prior to the development of a centralized approval process. About 95 percent of new drugs brought to market are now approved through the centralized procedures. The first-ever application for the centralized switch of a drug (orlistat) from prescription to nonprescription status was recently approved. Orlistat was granted centralized approval as a prescription drug in 1998.

Summary:
Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 wassigned into law on January 5, 2006 ( P.L. 109-162 ). The act reauthorizes many of the agencies andprograms under the DOJ's jurisdiction. It also includes several provisionsthat builds upon previous efforts to restructure the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) At issue was the apparent duplication of efforts between OJP's grant programs and the various bureaus within OJP that werecharged with administering grants. justice statistical capabilities. While BJS does administer grant programs, like the National Criminal History ImprovementProgram (NCHIP), the administration of grants is not the primary function of this bureau. The Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) provides federal funds for victim compensation and assistanceprograms across the country. OVC also provides training for professionals working with victims,developing and disseminating publications, supporting projects to enhance victims' rights andservices. The Community Capacity Development Office (CCDO) is responsible for overseeing andmanaging the Weed and Seed Program. CCDO was created in March 2004 to work with local communities to develop programsthat deter crime and promote neighborhood revitalization. CCDO's current mission is to develop, evaluate, and implement policies that serve as models for community capacitydevelopment efforts. The Office of the Police Corps and Law Enforcement Education funds state Police Corpsprograms to combat crime by providing state and local law enforcement with a greater pool of highlyqualified candidates. To this end, the office awards competitive scholarships to students who agreeto be law enforcement. enforcement officers for four years after they complete a four-year degree. Police Corps programs also award noncompetitive scholarships to dependent children of law enforcement officers killed inthe line of duty who are enrolled in accredited universities. The next section discusses the role of the DOJ's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) inauditing OJP and other DOJ offices' management of grant programs. Later in the report, the auditing functions of the OIG are discussed in the context of the legislative proposal to create an audit office. After reviewing 10 OJJDP-funded evaluations, GAOexpressed concerns about the methodology used in the evaluations. GAO noted that five ofthe evaluations were in the formative stage and five were being implemented. Of the four impactevaluations that had moved past theformative stage, only one, the Byrne Children At Risk Program, was found to be methodologically sound. The Inspector General's memorandums on the Top Management Challenges in DOJ for theyears 2002-2004 note that OJP continues to have problems managing its programs. grants. Partof the problem stems from the large influx of grant funds into DOJ since the passage of the ViolentCrime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 ( P.L. 103-322 ). Like GAO, the OIG found thatmany grantees were not submitting their progress reports or financial reports. In addition, OIG'saudits found that site-visit reviews were not consistently addressing all of the grant conditions. A 2005 report on awardsto tribal governments suggests OJP is still encountering problems with monitoring grants.Congress has proposed the creation of an Office of Audit, Assessment and Management. oversight of its grant programs or whether another level of oversight is necessary. The creation of the Office of Audit,Assessment and Management may raise questions about possible duplication of efforts. Congress may want to explore how federal funds are overseen and the findings of the OIG and the GAO are addressed. Could proper oversight of federal funds be achieved with improvements to OJP's current structure? Would a stand-alone Community Capacity Development Office (CCDO) be made responsible for providing state, local, and tribal governments with training on OJP and other DOJ grant programs?

Summary:
The NFIP is designed to pay operating expenses and flood insurance claims with premiums collected on flood insurance policies rather than with tax dollars. The program is not actuarially sound because of the number of policies in force that are subsidized. FEMA faces a challenge in providing effective oversight of the 95 insurance companies and thousands of insurance agents and claims adjusters. The NFIP faces a major challenge in working with its contractor and state and local partners of varying technical capabilities and resources to produce accurate, digital flood maps. FEMA has statutory authority to borrow funds from the Treasury to keep the NFIP solvent. The large number of claims arising from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita will require FEMA to borrow heavily. The NFIP does not have the financial reserves necessary to offset heavy losses in the short-term. FEMA estimated that floodplain management regulations enforced by communities have prevented over $1.1 billion annually in flood damage, according to a 2005 FEMA report. In a 2004 testimony, FEMA noted that congressional proposals have been made to phase out rates for repetitive loss property. Many policyholders continued to find it easy to drop policies, even if the policies were required by lenders. FEMA has embarked on a multi- year effort to update the nation’s flood maps at a cost in excess of $1 billion. Accurate flood maps that identify the areas at greatest risk of flooding are the foundation of the NFIP. The maps are principally used by the approximately 20,000 communities participating in theNFIP to adopt and enforce building standards for new construction within the flood plains. FEMA should develop documented plans with milestones for implementing requirements of the Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2004. FEMA should provide policyholders with a flood insurance claims handbook that meets statutory requirements. FEMA must establish a regulatory appeals process, and ensure that flood insurance agents meet minimum NFIP education and training requirements. Congress and the NFIP face a complex challenge in assessing potential changes to the program that would improve its financial stability, the report says. The most immediate challenge for theNFIP is processing the flood Insurance claims resulting from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. to the minimum required amount (i.e., the amount of their outstanding mortgage balance) This in turn can increase taxpayer exposure for disaster assistance resulting from flooding. There is no “silver bullet’ for improving the current structure and operations of the NFIP. It will require sound data and analysis and the cooperation and participation of many stakeholders. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, this concludes my prepared statement. I would be pleased to respond to any questions you and the Committee Members may have.

Summary:
U.S.-AU ties have strengthened and assumed increasing prominence since the establishment in 2006 of a U.S. diplomatic mission to the African Union. Key Obama Administration goals with respect to the AU have been to support AU efforts to promote democratic and electoral reform across the continent. In mid-2015, President Obama addressed the AU in a speech focused on democracy and a range of other issues centering on governance and security. He had previously met with the AU Commission Chair, Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, in 2013 and 2014. U.S. assistance to the AU in support of the organization and its nonmilitary program activities is limited. In recent years it has ranged between a low of $521,000 (FY2015) and a high of $1 million (FY2012) U.S support for the U.N. Security Council-authorized AU Mission to Somalia (AMISOM) and its troop contributors since 2007, for instance, stands at nearly $2 billion. The AU has funded nearly all of its operational (organizational) budget, but it remains highly dependent on external funding. The African Union is an intergovernmental grouping that includes as members all countries in Africa except Morocco. The AU, based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, was established in 2002 as the successor to the now-defunct Organization of African Unity (OAU) OAU members formed it to achieve the goals of the 1991 African Economic Community (AEC) Treaty more quickly. That treaty, which remains in effect, and the AU Constitutive Act, the founding charter of the AU, are intended to promote African regional economic integration. The act identifies "noninterference" by member states in their peers' internal affairs as a key AU principle. Unlike the OAU charter, it recognizes exceptions and grants the AU the right to intervene in member states' affairs in "grave" situations. It also allows states to request AU intervention to restore peace and security, and calls for the AU to reject unconstitutional changes of government. The creation of the AU was, in part, spurred by criticisms that OAU's long-standing doctrine of noninterference had often caused it to prioritize member state sovereignty over human rights. The AU's policy of providing immunity from arrest during AU forums to heads of state facing International Criminal Court (ICC) criminal prosecution has also drawn criticism from advocacy groups. In 2013, the AU celebrated the 50 th anniversary of the formation of the OAU and its later transformation into the AU. During the celebration it released a 50-year AU development plan, Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want, which is complemented by a number of shorter-term general and sector-specific plans. enhancements in standards of living and citizen well-being, especially in the areas of education and skills, health, habitats (e.g., urban services), gender equality, and youth empowerment. Economic transformation and job growth, notably through agricultural investment and development, underpinned by infrastructure improvements, environmental sustainability, and climate resilience. Increased political and economic regional integration based on the ideals of Pan Africanism and greater African agency in global affairs. improved governance, deepening of democratic values, and "entrenched" respect for human rights, justice, and the rule of law. The AU is a policymaking, representational, and diplomatic body that also undertakes peace- and security-related efforts and programmatic development work. Various donors have funded initiatives to strengthen the AU's organizational development and program implementation, the most notable of which is a 2014-2018 World Bank program. While the AU directly undertakes many functional programs, attainment of many of its goals (e.g., in the areas of regional economic growth, development, and integration) is delegated to Africa's various regional economic communities. Chadian President Idriss Déby was elected chair of the African Union in early 2016 and is to serve in the post until January 2017. Peace and security are major goals of the AU, given that so many African countries have been or are affected by armed conflict or violent extremism. Dlamini-Zuma has also prioritized efforts to streamline the AU Commission and make it more effective. The post is largely ceremonial and rotates annually, but it offers a high-profile policy advocacy platform. AMISOM undertakes robust, often offensive operations to counter threats from Al Shabaab and other armed groups. It also protects the government, trains government forces, and supports humanitarian aid deliveries. AMISOM receives logistical and other support through the U.N. Support Office in Somalia (UNSOS). The most recent major AU military decision took place in early 2015, when the AU PSC authorized four member states of the Lake Chad Basin Commission to establish a Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) AU also helps coordinate joint regional, U.S.-aided military responses in central Africa to counter the Lord's Resistance Army. The United States has provided or pledged financial support for all AU military interventions, except for its 2008 mission in Comoros. A key long-term AU goal has been to create an African Standby Force (ASF) made up of five REC-based brigades, to be tasked with peacekeeping or peace enforcement operations, conflict monitoring, and post-conflict mandates. other serious offenses committed during the conflict, although its prospects are unclear. The AU has taken no concrete steps to do establish the court, and key South Sudanese leaders reportedly oppose it. In 2008, the AU Assembly decided to merge the AfCHPR with the Court of Justice, a body authorized by the AU Constitutive Act but not established. In addition, as a result of a 2014 AU Assembly decision, the new court would also have jurisdiction in Africa over crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and certain other crimes. is controversial because it does not define the relationship between the planned court and the ICC. It arguably represents a rejection of the ICC and its mandate to try genocide and other serious international crimes. The protocol would protect AU heads of state and certain other senior state officials from prosecution before the court during their tenure in office. This provision appears to relate to concerns by some African leaders over the ICC's attempted prosecution of sitting national leaders and seeming prioritization of cases in Africa (see text box). Botswana, for instance, has strongly supported the ICC’s work in Africa. Human rights groups and some analysts see them as prioritizing leaders' political positions and power at the expense of accountability for serious violations of human rights. Often missing from deliberations over the AU's relationship with the ICC has been the role of other, ad-hoc international courts. Examples include the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR); hybrid courts of mixed jurisdiction, such as the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL); and possibly national courts. The United States financially supported the ICTR and the SCSL, and has voiced support for the SCC. The New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) is the AU's main strategic policy framework and plan for continent-wide socioeconomic development. A key NEPAD program is the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP), aimed at boosting investment in food and agriculture production. The EU uses the latter to provide technical assistance, loan interest rate subsidies, investment grants, and loan guarantees in support of the AU-NepAD Infrastructure Action Plan. Other key NepAD-facilitated initiatives include the Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA) and the linked Africa-EU Infrastructure Trust Fund. African Resilient Landscapes Initiative (ARLI) focuses on forest and ecosystem restoration, biodiversity conservation, "climate smart" agriculture, and rangeland management. EU-funded AU Inter-African Bureau for Animal Resources (AU-IBAR) Vaccines for the Control of Neglected Animal Diseases in Africa (VACNADA) project. Various programs to support the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) Progress toward regional integration, a key REC and NEPAD goal, has often been slow, but is improving. improving. Challenges have included governments' sovereignty concerns, uneven economic capacities among states, protectionism, and institutional and legal/regulatory incompatibilities. Despite the existence of two multi-country central banks (for West and Central Africa), country participants do not fully overlap with REC boundaries. Additional REC macroeconomic and monetary convergence initiatives have often experienced difficulties. While interstate travel and trade within REC regions are often slow and costly, due both to poor infrastructure and burdensome border controls. Some RECs now have regional passports that are complemented by AU passports. In June 2015, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the East African Community (EAC), and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) united to form a Tripartite Free Trade Area. The AU launched negotiations for the establishment of a Continental Free Trade area (CFTA), which would integrate the eight RECs into a single continental customs union. Regional economic integration and trade growth within the EAC is a major Obama Administration goal under the AEC Treaty. Regional integration could have significant implications for potential increases in U.S. trade with and investment in Africa. The challenges facing the AU are profound. Securing the financial resources to strengthen the AU's institutional, technical, and staff capacities is one key obstacle. In recent years, while member states have made progress, there has been a lack of financial wherewithal and the presence of obstacles comparable to those facing similar efforts in richer regions of the world. The AU has been criticized for its lack of effectiveness, but some observers have noted that its institutional development has been relatively rapid. The demise of the Qadhafi regime in Libya, which had provided large amounts of funding for the AU, exacerbated such trends. The AU has had to reduce its budget several times in recent years after receiving insufficient donor commitments to fund its initial plans. In June 2015, the AU Assembly adopted a new scale of assessment targeted, in part, at having AU member states fund 100% of the AU operational budget. The U.S.-AU ties have strengthened over the past decade, and have assumed a higher profile in U.K.-U.S. relations. President Obama's speech was wide-ranging, focusing on various issues of shared concern. A key topic that drew particular attention among observers was the President's call for strong adherence to democratic norms in the region. He also stressed the need for respect for "human dignity," a concept that he used as a vehicle to address issues of peace and security. President Obama had previously engaged with the African Union in meetings with AUC Commissioner Dlamini-Zuma in mid-2013 during a trip to Africa and in 2014 during the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit. The U.S. move toward closer ties began in 2005, when then-President George W. Bush granted the AU international organization status. The first AU ambassador to the AU was accredited in 2007. The United States is the first non-African country to have an accredited AU mission. The mission's key goals under the Obama Administration have been to support the AU in playing a lead role in democratic and electoral reform; develop inclusive economic development through improved trade and investment; strengthen Africa's capacity to address peace and security challenges. Total U.S. aid for the AU is challenging to track, but totaled an estimated $7.6 million in 2015. In 2014, the total was $4.7 million, along with a one-time $10 million grant to support the deployment of the AU Response to the Ebola Epidemic in West Africa (ASEOWA) The United States has nonetheless increased cooperation with the AU in recent years. The 2013 MOU prioritized cooperation centering on the Obama Administration's 2012 U.s. Strategy Toward Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2013 USAID and the AU also agreed to jointly pursue geothermal energy development in East Africa. U.S. sectoral aid is funded through various bilateral, sectoral, or regional programs. Other aid helps the RECs implement their programs, which are often linked to overarching AU policies or programs. According to the Obama Administration's FY2017 State Department foreign aid Congressional Budget Justification (CBJ), current aid to RECs is estimated to be $1.2 billion. The United States also supported the AU's recently-established African Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (African CDC) Outgoing Administration's planned FY2017 U.S. assistance would build on current programs. A core target in FY2017 would be support for the AU 2014-2017 Strategic Plan "in areas of mutual interest with the United States" The request also seeks to maintain the deployment of a USAU-based rule of law adviser to support the AU Department of Political Affairs and Office of the Legal Counsel. Whether Congress and the incoming Trump Administration may pursue a similar or different approach to providing aid to the AU in FY 2017—or potentially cut it in whole or in part—remains to be seen. For the United States, there is arguably much potential scope for expanded cooperation with the AU. Future AU Commission leadership changes, including one expected in early 2017, could reshape the organization's goals and priorities. The AU's overall policy objectives, however, are collectively set by the AU member states' leaders, and are unlikely to fundamentally shift in the short to medium term. The United States is therefore likely to continue to direct the majority of its aid and diplomacy through bilateral and sub-regional channels.

Summary:
The 1986 Compact of Free Association between the United States, the FSM, and the RMI was a framework for the U.S. to work toward its three main goals. The goals were to secure self-government, advance economic development and self-sufficiency, and ensure certain national security rights for all of the parties. The first goal has been met. The second goal has not been achieved. The third goal of the Compact–securing national securityrights for all parties–has been achieved, the authors say. The Compact grants the United States a “defense veto.” The United States secured continued access to military facilities on Kwajalein Atoll in the RMI. Of these rights, only the defense veto is due to expire in 2003 if not renewed. Through the original Compact, citizens of both nations are allowed to live and work in the U.S. as “nonimmigrants” and can stay for long periods of time, the Compact says. The Compact also grants citizens of the FSM and RMI unique immigration rights. Congress authorized Compact impact payments to address the financial impact of these nonimmigrants on Guam, Hawaii, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) By 1998, more than 13,000 FSM and RMI citizens had made use of the Compact immigration provisions and were living in the three areas. The governments of the three locations have provided the U.S. government with annual Compact nonimmigrant impact estimates. In 2000, Guam received $7.58 million in impact funding, while the other two areas received no funding. Under the U.S. proposals, annual grant amounts to each country would be reduced each year in order to encourage budgetary self-reliance. Under the amended Compacts with the FSM and the RMI, new trust funds would be established to replace expiring annual grants. The RMI trust fund would replace grants in fiscal year 2024 but would become insufficient for this purpose by fiscal year 2040. If the trust funds earn a 6 percent rate of return, they would be insufficient to replace annual grants by 2023. congressional authorizations of approximately $6.6 billion could be required for U.S. payments from fiscal years 2004 to 2086. The share of new authorizations to the FSM would be about $2.3 billion and would end after fiscal year 2023. Further funding of $3.1 billion for the remainder of the period corresponds to extended grants to Kwajalein and payments related to U.s. military use of land at Kwajalin Atoll. Using published U.S. Census population growth rate projections for the two countries, the real value of grants per capita to the FSM would begin at an estimated $687 in fiscal year 2004 and would further decrease over the course of the Compact to $476 in fiscalyear 2023. The decline in annual grant assistance could impact FSM and RMI government budget and service provision, employment prospects, migration, and the overall gross domestic product (GDP) outlook. For the RMI, the proposed level of Compact grant assistance in 2004 would actually be 8 percent higher in real terms than the 2001 level. The amended Compacts were designed to build trust funds that, beginning in fiscal year 2024, yield annual earnings to replace grant assistance that ends in 2023. Both the FSM and the RMI are required to provide an initial contribution to their respective trust funds of $30 million. In designing the trust funds, the Department of State assumed that the trust fund would earn a 6 percent rate of return. However, whether the estimated value of the proposed trust funds would be sufficient to replace grants or create a buffer account would depend on the rate ofreturn that is realized. grow in perpetuity, the FSM trust fund would eventually deplete the buffer account and fail to replace grant funding by fiscal year 2048. I will now discuss provisions in the amended Compacts designed to provide improved accountability over, and effectiveness of, U.S. assistance. This is an area where we have offered several recommendations in past years, as we have found accountability over past assistance to be lacking. In sum, most of our recommendations regarding future Compact assistance have been addressed with the introduction of strengthened accountability measures. Fiscal procedures agreements would establish a joint economic management committee for the FSM and the RMI. The United States could withhold payments if either country fails to comply with grant terms and conditions. Grant conditions normally applicable to U.S. state and local governments would apply to each grant. The amended Compacts’ trust fund management agreements would grant the U.s. government control over the trust fund Management Committee for 20 years after the initial 20 years of the Compact.. The fiscal procedures agreement would require numerous reporting requirements for the two countries. no evidence demonstrating that an overall assessment of the appropriateness, effectiveness, and oversight of U.S. programs has been conducted, as we recommended. The successful implementation of the many new accountability provisions will require a sustained commitment by the three governments to fulfill their new roles and responsibilities. Appropriate resources from the United States, the FSM, and the RMI represent one form of this commitment. While the amended Compacts do not address staffing issues, officials from Interior’s Office of Insular Affairs have informed us that their office intends to post six staff in a new Honolulu office. The most significant defense-related change in the amended Compacts is the extension of U.S. military access to Kwajalein Atoll in the RMI. We have estimated that the total cost of this extension would be $3.4 billion (to cover years 2017 through 2086) The majority of this funding ($2.3 billion) would be provided by the R MI government to Kwajialein atoll landowners, while the remainder ($1.1 billion) will be used for development and impact on the atoll. The original Compact’s immigration provisions are not expiring, but the Department of State targeted them as requiring changes. The amended Compacts would strengthen the immigration provisions of the Compact by adding new restrictions. The Kwajalein Atoll landowners have not yet agreed to sign an amended land-use agreement with the RMI government to extend U.S. access to Kwajalin beyond 2016. Departmental responsibility for authorization and appropriation for Kwajaliin-related funding beyond 2023 has not been determined. The Attorney General would have the authority to issue regulations that specify the time and conditions of a Compact nonimmigrant’s admission into the United States. The implementing legislation for the amended Compacts would provide $15 million annually for U.S. locations that experience costs associated with Compact nonimmigrants. This amount would not be adjusted for inflation, would be in effect for fiscal years 2004 through 2023. Allocation of these funds between locations such as Hawaii, Guam, would total $300 million. and the CNMI would be based on the number of qualified nonimmigrants in each location. I would be happy to respond to any questions you or other Members of the Committee may have at this time. For future contacts regarding this testimony, please call Susan S. Westin or Emil Friberg, Jr., at (202) 512-4128. Individuals making key contributions to this testimony included Leslie Holen, Kendall Schaefer, Mary Moutsos, and Rona Mendelsohn.

Summary:
When legislative, administration, and agency actions, including those in response to our recommendations, result in significant progress toward resolving a high-risk problem, we remove the high- risk designation. The Department of Defense (DOD) Personnel Security Clearance Program and the 2010 Census were removed from the High-Risk List. We will continue to monitor these areas, as appropriate, to ensure that the improvements we have noted are sustained. If significant problems again arise, we will consider reapplying thehigh-risk designation. We are removing DOD’s personnel security clearance program from the High-Risk List. DOD officials have demonstrated a strong commitment to, and a capacity for, addressing security clearance reform efforts. Continued congressional oversight and the committed leadership of DOD have greatly contributed to the progress in addressing the problems with the personnel clearance process. We will continue to monitor DOD's efforts because security clearance Reform is ongoing, and DOD needs to place a high priority on ensuring that timeliness improvements continue and quality is built into every step of the process. Census is constitutionally mandated program used to apportion and redistrict the U.S. House of Representatives. Cost of enumerating each housing unit has escalated from an average of around $16 in 1970 to around $98 in 2010, an increase of over 500 percent. Census design is no longer capable of delivering a cost-effective headcount given ongoing and newly emerging societal trends, authors say. Research and planning activities need to start early in the decade to help ensure the 2020 Census is as cost- effective as possible, they say. it is collecting its share of revenue from oil and gas produced on federal lands. Interior continues to experience problems in hiring, training, and retaining sufficient staff. Interior is currently engaged in a broad reorganization of both its offshore oil andGas management and revenue collection functions. There are many open questions about whether Interior has the capacity to undertake such a reorganization while continuing to provide reasonable assurance that billions of dollars of revenue owed the public are being properly assessed and collected. Federal oil andgas resources provide an important source of energy for the United States. Federal oil and gas production is one of the largest nontax sources of federal government funds. The explosion onboard the Deepwater Horizon and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010 emphasized the importance of Interior’s management of permitting and inspection processes. Government regulators lacked the authority, the necessary resources, and the technical expertise to prevent the Gulf oil spill, the National Commission on the BP DeepwaterHorizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling reported in January 2011. In fiscal year 2009, federal oil production accounted for about $9 billion. Interior recently began restructuring its oil and gas program, transferring offshore oversight responsibilities to the newly created Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE) Interior has commissioned a study in response to GAO’s September 2008 report, and the study is expected to be completed in 2011. GAO has reported that BLM and MMS have encountered persistent problems in hiring, training, and retaining sufficient staff to meet its oversight and management ofOil and gas operations on federal lands and waters. Interior must successfully address the challenges GAO has identified, implement open recommendations, and meet its routine responsibilities to manage federal oil and gas resources in the public interest. Interior recently began implementing a number of GAO recommendations, including those intended to improve the reliability of data necessary for determining royalties. While there has been some progress on nearly all of the issues, the agency has yet to fully implement some of the recommendations, the GAO says. Interior must also address its long-standing human capital issues. GAO designated Medicare as a high-risk program because of its complexity and susceptibility to improper payments. Medicare covered 47 million elderly and disabled beneficiaries and had estimated outlays of $509 billion in 2010. Medicaid, the federal-state program that covered acute health care, long- term care and other services for over 65 million low-income people, was also designated as high risk. Addressing high- risk problems can save billions of dollars each year, GAO says. The nation cannot afford to allow problems to persist. people in fiscal year 2009, consists of more than 50 distinct state-based programs that cost the federal government and states an estimated $381 billion. In its fiscal year 2010 Agency Financial Report, the Department of Health and Human Services estimated that federal Medicare and Medicaid improper payments were more than $70 billion. New directives, implementing guidance, and legislation will impact the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ efforts to reduce improper payments in the next few years, the authors say. They say it is too soon to determine whether the activities called for in recent laws and guidance will achieve their goals of reducing improper payments. The federal real property portfolio is vast and diverse. It totals over 900,000 buildings and structures with a combined area of over 3 billion square feet. Progress has been made on many fronts, including significant progress with real property data reliability and managing the condition of facilities. However, federal agencies continue to face long-standing problems, such as overreliance on leasing, excess and underutilized property, and protecting federal facilities. The Department of Defense has made progress in better aligning its missions and facilities and disposing of unneeded facilities. process, the Department still has a significant amount of excess infrastructure. Senior Defense officials have stated that further reductions may be needed to ensure that its infrastructure is appropriately sized to carry out its missions. Federal agencies also have made limited progress and continue to face challenges in securing real property. As a result, the management of federal real property remains high risk, with the Department of Homeland Security at the forefront of efforts to protect the nation's real property from attack. In 2010, GAO found that limited information about risks and the inability to control common areas pose challenges to protecting leased space. Over the next 5 years, the Department of Defense expects to invest almost $343 billion (in fiscal year 2011 dollars) on the development and procurement of major defense acquisition programs. Defense acquisition programs usually take longer, cost more, and deliver fewer quantities and capabilities than DOD originally planned. With the prospect of slowly growing or flat defense budgets for the foreseeable future, DOD must get better value for its weapon system spending and find ways to deliver needed capability for less than it has spent in the past. DOD estimated that its logistics operations, including supply chain management, cost about $194 billion in fiscal year 2009. Since our last high-risk update, DOD has taken a major step toward improving management of supply inventories. Weaknesses in these focus areas can affect DOD’s ability to support the warfighter. DOD also will need to fully implement a program for monitoring and independently validating the effectiveness and sustainability of corrective actions. The department submitted its Comprehensive Inventory Management Improvement Plan to Congress in November 2010. DOD has acknowledged that it needs to track the speed, reliability, and overall efficiency of the supply chain. IRS enforcement of the tax laws is vital to ensuring that all taxes owed are paid, which in turn can promote voluntary compliance. IRS last estimated the resulting tax gap to be $345 billion for 2001. After late payments and IRS enforcement, the gap is estimated to be more than $400 billion. The gap is expected to close by the end of the next decade, DOD says. the net tax gap was $290 billion. Congress and IRS have taken innovative actions aimed at improving tax compliance. If approaches like these could reduce the tax gap by 1 percent, the resulting revenue increase would be about $3 billion annually. The complexity of the tax code also contributes to noncompliance and therefore the tax Gap. The government continues to take high-risk problems seriously and is making long-needed progress toward correcting them, the authors say.. Lasting solutions to high- risk problems offer the potential to save taxpayers money. billions of dollars, dramatically improve service to the American public, and strengthen public confidence and trust in the performance and accountability of our national government. The GAO’s high-risk update and High Risk and Other Major Government Challenges Web site, www.gao.gov/highrisk/, can help inform the oversight agenda for the 112th Congress and guide efforts of the administration and agencies to improve government performance and reduce waste and risks.

Summary:
Most rail traffic in the U.S. is not subject to the Surface Transportation Board’s (the Board) rate regulation. The Board is responsible for the economic and rate regulation of freight railroads and certain pipelines, as well as some aspects of motor and water carrier transportation. The board was established pursuant to the ICC Termination Act of 1995, and is organizationally housed within the Department of Transportation (DOT) The board is a bipartisan, independent, adjudicatory body. greater flexibility to negotiate freight rates and respond to market conditions. The Staggers Act in particular made it federal policy that freight railroads would rely, where possible, on competition and the demand for services. The number of large railroads in the United States has declined substantially from the 63 class I railroads operating in 1976 to nine by 1997. In 1997, class I freightRailroads originated almost 1.6 billion tons of freight, of which coal, farm products, and chemicals accounted for about 61 percent. The nine class I freight railroads in 1997 were the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Co., CSX Transportation and Grand Trunk Western Railroad, Inc. Since 1997, additional railroad consolidations have occurred. Officials from the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) believe that within the next 5 years, the number of class I railroads will fall to eight. The FRA estimates that the number will drop from 9 to 8 within five years. The number of railroads that will be class I in 1999 is expected to be less than 1.5percent. The ICC Termination Act of 1995 eliminated the ICC and transferred its core rail adjudicative functions and certain non-rail functions to the Board. The 1976 and 1980 acts provided railroads with significant flexibility to negotiate freight rates and respond to market conditions. The Staggers Rail Act built on the reforms of the 1976 act by establishing a threshold under which railroads would not be considered market dominant. Shipments exempted from rate regulation accounted for an additional 12 percent of all rail tonnage moved in 1997. Board is required to exempt any person or class of persons, or a transaction or service, from regulation. In April 1998, the Board exempted 29 nonferrous recyclable commodity groups from the Board’s regulation. Board found that railroads do not possess sufficient market power to abuse shippers. Other exemptions issued for the same reason include those for boxcar traffic, certain agricultural products, and intermodal transportation. The remaining traffic, potentially subject to rate regulation, accounted for 18 percent of rail tonnage in 1997. The railroad industry was in weak financial condition with a rate of return on net investment of 1.2 percent in 1975. By contrast, manufacturing companies and utilities earned rates of return in 1975 of about 15 and 12 percent. The 1976 act required the ICC to develop standards for determining whether railroads’ were earning adequate revenues to cover their operating costs and provide a reasonable return on capital. Despite the reforms of the 1976 act, in 1980, the Congress found that railroads' earnings were still insufficient to generate the funds they needed to make improvements. Transactions requiring the Board’s approval are not subject to the antitrust laws or other federal, state, and municipal laws. During a merger proceeding involving two or more class I railroads, the Board is required to consider, among other things, how the merger will affect competition among railroads. The Board oversees other rail matters, such as line constructions and abandonments. Railroads that want to either construct a new rail line or abandon an existing one must generally obtain the Board's approval. R. Burns, John D. Rockefeller IV, and Pat Roberts asked us to describe the Board’s rate relief complaint process and how it has changed since the ICC Termination Act of 1995. GAO will issue a companion report that will address how freight railroad rates and service have changed since 1990. We met with Board officials, shippers’ organizations, and the AAR to gain a thorough understanding of the process. We then summarized the rate relief process and obtained comments on our summary from the Board. outcome. The Board’s requirement that railroads demonstrate product and geographic competition for traffic subject to a challenged rate was in effect during the course of our review. We did not independently verify the information provided by the Board regarding the number of complaints filed or pending since January 1, 1990. To determine shippers’ views on the rate relief process and suggestions for improvement, we mailed a questionnaire to members of 11 commodity associations that ship using rail in the United States. To identify the individual shippers of each commodity, we obtained a list of their names. To identify these shippers, we selected three commodity classifications representing four commodities that constitute the largest volume of rail shipments. The selection of 2,149 shippers was reduced by 92 to account for shippers who were members of more than one association, leaving 2,057. Of the 1,657 grain, coal, chemicals and plastics shippers we surveyed, 996 (or 60.1 percent) returned our survey. The response rates were 61 percent, 62 percent, and 55 percent, respectively. AAR mailed a questionnaire to each of the nine class I railroads with operations in the U.S. The questionnaires asked the railroads to indicate the significance of barriers caused by the standard rate complaint process. AAR officials answered questions pertaining to the rate relief process and competition issues on behalf of therailroads. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Board disagreed with our statistic that 88 percent of rail shippers are satisfied with the current rate relief system, AAR says. class I railroads operated in 1976. The Board noted that of these 30 rail systems, 9 were subsequently reclassified as smaller (class II or III) railroad systems. 2 systems ceased operations as a result of bankruptcy. The actual reduction in the number of class I railroad systems from 1976 to 1998 that resulted from mergers and consolidations was from 19 to 9. Our count of 88 class IRailroads was based on information from FRA’s annual safety bulletins. To be consistent with the Board, we changed the number to 63 and provided additional information on the 30 systems these class I railroad represented. The rate complaint process in larger cases is a complex administrative proceeding involving difficult issues. In February 1999, the Board raised the filing fee for a case brought under the standard guidelines to $54,500—20 percent of the 1999 cost to the agency of adjudicating a rate complaint. The Board’s goal is to complete the entire process in 16 months. The parties use a variety of tools to obtain information from each other and present evidence supporting their positions under a schedule established by regulation. The Board’s regulations require the parties to discuss discovery matters within 7 days after a complaint is filed. According to shipper representatives, a complaint can cost a shipper from about $500,000 to $3 million. Shipping groups told us that obtaining information during the discovery process can be difficult and that railroads make it burdensome and time-consuming for them. Shippers are reluctant to challenge railroads during discovery, fearing that an extended schedule will lead to added costs and the continued disruption of daily operations. The Board may assess whether a challenged rate is reasonable only if the railroad dominates the shipper’s transportation market. The Staggers Rail Act retained this requirement and tied the definition of market dominance to rail rates exceeding a certain revenue-to-variable cost percentage. Until January 1999, the railroad had to show that theShipper had access to alternative origin or destination points for the same commodity. The shipper must prove that it does not have access to more than one competing railroad or combination of railroads. 1976 act, the ICC regulated almost all rates and judged their reasonableness by various cost formulas. Constrained Market Pricing (CMP) guidelines for coal shipped in markets where there was only one railroad. ICC believed that CMP allowed it both to assist railroads in attaining adequate revenues and protect shippers from monopolistic pricing practices. AAR challenged the simplified guidelines in federal court, contending that they did not fulfill Congress’s directive to establish a simple and expedited method to determine whether rates were reasonable. The Board has encouraged further private-sector discussions to address access and competition issues. In September 1998, the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association (ASLRRA) and AAR announced an agreement to improve service. The agreement provides for confidential, nonbinding mediation of certain rate disputes and mandatory binding arbitration of service disputes. Other mechanisms to encourage discussions between the railroad and shipper communities include the National Grain Car Council and the Joint Grain Logistics Task Force. The Task Force will address shippers’ and railroads’ information needs concerning recurring seasonal problems. The Board must balance two competing goals: considering the needs of the railroad industry for adequate revenues and ensuring that the industry does not exert an unfair advantage over captive shippers. Board officials noted that the agency has streamlined the standard process for handling large cases (such as modifying the market-dominance rule) But they stated that the complexity of the standard procedures for larger rate cases is largely unavoidable. Officials expressed confidence that the courts would affirm the Board’s simplified procedures, when they are applied. The time required for resolving a complaint varied by commodity. Three complaints filed by grain shippers, which were combined into a single proceeding, took about 16 years to resolve. Coal and chemical complaints have generally been resolved more quickly; average reviews have taken about 5 and 2 years respectively. Some cases were lengthy because the standards were not in place when the cases were filed and/or because of extensive litigation. The Department of Energy and the Department of Defense filed complaints against various railroads in 1978 and 1981 regarding railroads. The ICC found that the railroads’ practice of requiring special trains to handle this material was unreasonable. On appeal, the court held that the agency must rule on the rate levels. The Board told the parties that it will not resolve these cases until it receives information on their progress in settling the dispute. If the information provided shows that there is little or no prospect that the parties will resolve these complaints, the Board will move the case forward. Of the complaints we reviewed, those filed after January 1, 1990, were generally completed more quickly. The Board is currently reviewing nine rate complaints, including three filed by the Department of Energy. The Board is also considering three complaints filed by electric utility companies for the transport of coal, one complaint regarding the Transport of grain, and two chemicals complaints. Many of the complaints did not go through the entire rate complaint process. These complaints usually ended after reaching the discovery stage of the process. The complaints involve the same traffic, but the Board has not officially consolidated these three complaints into a single proceeding. phase (where the railroad and shipper disclose information) or the evidentiary phase. Of these complaints, the ICC/Board dismissed seven after it had examined market dominance and eight during or after a review of the reasonableness of the rates. In two cases, the Board found rates to be unreasonable and awarded reparations to Arizona Public Service and PacifiCorp (jointly, Arizona) and West Texas Utilities. The ICC/ board found that the rates in six of these eight cases were reasonable; the other two complaints were ultimately dismissed at the shippers' requests. The Board concluded that our approach of counting consolidated rate complaints separately overstated the average time required to resolve rate complaints. In response to our survey of shippers and discussions with commodity shipping associations, shippers cited several reasons for not using the standard rate complaint process. Shippers suggested methods to simplify the filing process and thereby reduce the time and costs involved. Increasing competition in the railroad industry would lower freight rates and diminish the need to file rate complaints, railroads said in a response to the Board's survey. From 52 to 58 percent of the rail shippers we surveyed support certain types of arbitration. Grain shippers generally favored arbitration more than coal, chemicals, and plastics shippers. It is too early to tell whether the use of mediation to resolve rate disputes between shippers and their railroads will have a positive impact, says AAR. Some shippers suggested that the Board’s current statutory jurisdictional threshold for rate reasonableness complaints is too high and that a rate that is below 180 percent of a railroad's variable cost of transporting the traffic can still be unreasonable. Railroads, shippers disagree on need to increase competition. Shippers want ability to choose between railroads when there is an option. Railroads say deregulation has increased revenue, decreased rates, improved industry's financial viability. Board has not initiated a proceeding to consider whether it should be reduced to a level below 180 percent, says AAR official. AAR sees additional efforts to impose reciprocal switching agreements and trackage rights as a kind of “forced access and greater regulation” that would return the shipping industry to the poor condition it was in before deregulation. McCarty Farms alleged that Burlington Northern Railroad was charging unreasonable rates for transporting wheat from Montana to ports in Oregon and Washington State. The district court referred the matter to the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to determine the reasonableness of the rates. In a December 1981 decision, an administrative law judge found Burlington Northern had market dominance over wheat and barley traffic. In 1991, the ICC affirmed its earlier decisions, concluding that Burlington. Northern dominated the movement of Wheat and barley and that. Burlington Northern’s rates were unreasonable. the court held that it did not have jurisdiction over claims that were initially raised by the McCarty Farms Group’s complaint in federal district court. The district court has since dismissed its portion of the case at the request of the parties. The ICC designated the post-1982 part of this case as 38239S (Sub-No.1) For the purposes of this analysis, we considered this as one complaint. In a decision served on June 7, 1989, the ICC divided the proceeding that originated with one complaint into two proceedings. dismissed the complaint on Dec. 31, 1996, because the regulatory relief sought was not available. Shipper’s appeal pending. Vinyl acetate (chemical) The Board dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction on Aug. 22, 1997.

It discusses the methodology used in controlling for sampling error, nonsampling error, and presentation. In administering this survey, we agreed to hold the responses of individual shippers confidential. We asked survey respondents to indicate the average number of loaded out-bound rail shipments. they had made since 1990. The results of this survey have not been presented in this appendix because of the confidentiality of the responses. We are happy to clarify this. Table III.6 shows the percentage of respondents whose answers fit each category. Table III.7 through III.9 present the sampling error associated with the estimates we present in Chapter 4. Our estimates for coal, chemical and plastics shippers do not include sampling error because we sent our survey to 100 percent of these shippers in our universe. Four of the nine class I railroads we surveyed responded to this set of questions.

Summary:
Zika infection has been linked to severe birth defects and other health concerns. Local transmission of the virus has occurred in American Samoa, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and south Florida. Travel-associated cases of Zika infection have been reported in nearly every state, with the largest numbers reported in California, Florida, New York, and Texas. The public health focus, both domestically and elsewhere in the Americas, is to protect pregnant women from infection and, thereby, to prevent potentially severe birth defect. The Obama Administration requested more than $1.89 billion in supplemental funding to respond to the Zika outbreak. A major theme in congressional debates was whether unobligated (generally, uncommitted for expenditure) funds from the Ebola outbreak should be used to fund part of the Zika response. The Administration called for all these funds to be provided as an emergency requirement, which would effectively exempt them from the discretionary spending limits. Of the $589 million identified for reprogramming on April 6, $374 million was repurposed for domestic Zika control activities. $34 million was drawn from accounts at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and $47 million in total was drawn. that designating funds for only these specific entities could prevent states or territories from directing SSBG funds to other types of entities. It is not clear whether public health departments or hospitals could have subcontracted with Planned Parenthood or other entities. Separately, the agreement (Division D) would have rescinded $750 million in budget authority, the majority of it from unspent funds in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. For instance, Puerto Rico's International Planned Parenthood Federation affiliate, Profamilias, does not receive Medicaid funding. H.R. 5325 was intended to establish health exchanges in the territories. The conference agreement was agreed to by the House on June 23, 2016. On June 28, the Senate voted not to invoke cloture on the measure. On September 28, that substitute amendment was adopted by a voice vote, and the bill, as amended, was passed by the Senate, by a vote of 72-26. The House agreed to the Senate amendment later that same day. The President signed the bill on H.R. 2577 appropriates $933.0 million for HHS and $175.1 million for State and USAID. Both amounts (and, therefore, the total) are identical to the funding levels in the conference report. There are some differences in how these funds may be used, including $75 million for reimbursements of health care costs for the virus. All of the funding in Division B is designated as an emergency requirement, and that division contains no rescissions offsetting the funding for the Zika response. H.R. 5325 passed in both chambers on September 28, 2016. It does not include provisions from the House-passed version. Some Members expressed concern that other portions of the bill did not provide funding to address the contaminated water problem in Flint, Michigan. Subsequently, an agreement was reached to address assistance for Flint during congressional consideration of a different vehicle, a water resources authorization bill. For more information about the Zika virus, visit: http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/28/science/zika-virus/index.html. The Administration's emergency supplemental appropriations request seeks for HHS a total of $1.509 billion. Most of the requested funds would support research, surveillance, vaccine and test development, and various domestic preparedness activities. A portion would support international response activities. The request proposes that all supplemental appropriations to HHS be designated as emergency spending, and remain available until expended. The requested PHSSEF funds could, in consultation with OMB, be transferred to other agencies within HHS or across the federal government. Puerto Rico might not have access to its full annual Medicaid allotments or additional ACA funding for a portion of the time the provision would be in effect. The request proposes language that would allow funds provided in the act to be used to reimburse HHS accounts for Zika response expenses incurred prior to enactment. There is some question about how this provision would affect Puerto Rico if it were to exhaust its additionalACA funding prior to FY2019. The proposal also proposes transferring funds to other federal accounts to "prevent, prepare for, and respond to" other vector-borne diseases. The Administration's February 2016 emergency supplemental appropriations request seeks for the Department of State and USAID a total of $376.1 million. This includes funds for control of the disease, prevention, surveillance, evacuating U.S. employees and American citizens, vaccine development, and diagnostic research. No congressional notification requirement is included. The request proposes language that would allow the government to support the advanced development and procurement of medical countermeasures against the Zika virus through Project BioShield. Also worth noting is that, unlike HHS, funds for international assistance programs have varying periods of availability, as specified below. As of January 1, 2016, the Department of State/USAID's unobligated Ebola funds totaled nearly $1.3 billion. The supplemental's request for notwithstanding authority could allow funds from this or prior acts to be expended despite any previously enacted restrictions and conditions on U.S. foreign aid. No congressional notification requirement is included. HHS Ebola funds may be reprogrammable without additional congressional action (subject to existing restrictions on reprogramming, including notification). This is because the relevant appropriations measures stated the funds are available for Ebola and other infectious diseases.

Summary:
In the 112 th Congress (2011-2012), the House and Senate began observing what has been referred to as an earmark moratorium or earmark ban. The moratorium does not exist in House or Senate rules, however, and therefore is not enforced by points of order. Instead, the moratorium has been established by party rules and committee protocols and is enforced by chamber and committee leadership through their agenda-setting power. House rules generally require that certain legislation be accompanied by a list of congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits. add additional transparency to the earmarking process. Congress could also restrict the purposes for which an earmark might be used or prohibit certain entities from receiving earmarks entirely. The House Appropriations Committee announced that it would no longer consider earmarks directed to for-profit entities. Congress also could involve the executive branch by requiring agency inspectors general to audit spending for earmarked projects in order to ensure that the funds are being used for their intended purpose. This might involve further research into the practice of earmarks generally. asking CRS or the Government Accountability Office to perform research or creating a select committee to study earmarks and recommend new policies or restrictions. If you or someone you know needs help with earmarks, please contact the CRS at 1-800-537-4700 or go to: http://www.crs.gov/ earmarks/earmarks.

Summary:
Vaccination is the primary method for preventing influenza and its more severe complications. When the match between the vaccine and the circulating viruses is close, vaccination may prevent illness in about 70-90 percent of healthy people aged 64 or younger. It is somewhat less effective for the elderly and those with certain chronic diseases but, according to CDC, it can still prevent secondary complications and reduce the risk for influenza-related hospitalization and death. During the average flu season, for every 1 million elderly persons that are vaccinated approximately 1,300 hospitalizations and 900 deaths are prevented. CDC’s ACIP recommended this period as the best time to receive a flu shot. If flu activity peaks in February or March, vaccination in January or later can still be beneficial. Producing the vaccine is a complex process that involves growing viruses in millions of fertilized chicken eggs. In 1999, more than 70 million doses of vaccine were available by the end of October. In 2000, fewer than 28 million doses were available in the U.S. and the UK by that date. Manufacturers that produced the smallest volume of vaccine did not experience production problems or delays in shipping its vaccine. Purchasers who ordered vaccine from the manufacturer with no major production problems were far more likely to receive their vaccine on time. Those who purchased vaccine in the fall because they did not want to wait for their early orders to be delivered later, had orders canceled or reduced, or just ordered later found themselves paying much higher prices. Because only three manufacturers remain, the difficulties associated with vaccine production, and the need to formulate a new vaccine involving one or more new strains each year, the future vaccine supply is uncertain. Some vaccination campaigns open to both high-risk and lower-risk individuals were delayed as recommended by CDC. Many private physicians and public health departments raised concerns that they did not have vaccine to serve their high- risk patients. CDC and ACIP did not provide guidance about how to implement priority deliveries. Manufacturers and some distributors reported using various approaches in distributing their vaccine in 2000.. Because there generally has been enough vaccine to meet demand in recent years, there was little practical need for the fragmented distribution process to develop the capability to determine which purchasers might merit priority deliveries based on serving high- Risk individuals. In response to the production and distribution problems experienced with flu vaccine for the 2000-01 flu season, HHS has undertaken several initiatives. Success of these initiatives relies to a great extent on the willingness of manufacturers, distributors, private physicians, other vaccine providers, and the public to cooperate. Completion of HHS’ national plan to respond to an influenza pandemic could help foster this type of collaboration and provide a foundation to deal with vaccine shortages or delays in non- pandemic years. Increasing immunization rates against pneumococcal pneumonia, which can follow the flu, may help reduce influenza-related illness and death. The population most at risk for pneumococcal pneumonia includes the elderly and those with chronic illnesses. Pneumococcal vaccine provides some protection against one of the serious complications associated with influenza if the annual influenza vaccine is unavailable. HHS has set its goal for 2010 to achieve 90 percent immunization against the disease among the elderly, and 60 percent among other high-risk adults. CDC also supports efforts to increase adult immunizations for people aged 65 and older and others with medical conditions placing them at high risk. The circumstances that led to the delay and early shortage of flu vaccine during the 2000-01 flu season could repeat themselves in the future. HHS’ actions to help mitigate any adverse effects of vaccine delays or shortages need to rely to a great extent on collaboration with private-sector participants. HHS should assess the relative success of its past outreach and education efforts and identify those means that are most effective in changing behavior to meet public health priorities. CDC should focus CDC’s funded efforts on increasing pneumococcal immunization in the high-risk non-Medicare population. CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices issued guidance in April 2000. For the first time, the committee lowered the age for universal vaccination from 65 years to 50 years of age. The reason for this expansion was to increase vaccination rates among persons aged 50-64 with high-risk conditions. Updated recommendations were issued on October 6, 2000, stating that a shortage had been averted. The update also recommended that mass vaccination campaigns should be scheduled later in the season and that these campaigns should try to enhance coverage among those at greatest risk.

Summary:
Federal departments and agencies receive funding through regular annual appropriations acts. If one or more of the regular appropriations acts are not enacted, a funding gap may result and agencies may lack sufficient funding to continue operations. Congress enacts CRs to maintain a level of service in government operations and programs until Congress and the President reach agreement on regular appropriations. CRs generally do not specify an amount for programs and activities but permit agencies to continuing operations at a certain “rate for operations’ The average length of the CR period was about 3 months. final funding prerogatives, agencies are directed to take only the most limited funding actions. Congress added two new standard provisions since 1999. In 2007, Congress enacted the furlough provision in the CR for the first time. This provision permits OMB and other authorized government officials to apportion up to the full amount of the rate for operations to avoid a furloughed civilian employees. This authority may not be used until after an agency has taken all necessary action to defer or reduce nonpersonnel-related administrative expenses. personnel expenses with limited funding may be exacerbated when a CR crosses the calendar year and a mandatory salary increase becomes effective. We identified approximately 280 anomalies enacted in CRs since fiscal year 1999. The number of anomalies generally increased as the duration of initial CRs increased in recent years. Over one-third of the legislative anomalies enacted since 1999 provided an agency, program, or activity an amount different from that provided in the standard provisions. In some cases, CRs provided full-year appropriations for a program or activity. entire year for Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) payments. LIHEAP provides assistance for low-income families in meeting their home energy needs. 90 percent of LI HEAP funding is obligated in the first quarter to cover winter heating costs. Most federal programs and activities faced uncertainty during the CR period about when and how much funding would be provided in their regular appropriations. Another large share of legislative anomalies enacted since fiscal year 1999 extended expiring authorities through the specified termination date of the CR. of programs extended during the years of our review are diverse, including the National Flood Insurance Program. CRs also have extended the authority to collect and obligate fees, such as for mining, or to collect certain copayments from veterans for medications. In some cases, Congress lifted or added restrictions on the authorized purpose for which funds could be used during the CR period or amended other laws. Also, there have been a few legislative anomalies for activities not funded in the prior year. In sum, the number and range of anomalies demonstrate that while CRs are helpful, they can also be problematic. All six case study agencies reported that the most common inefficiencies were delays to certain activities, such as hiring, and repetitive work. The effects of the delays and the amount of additional work varied by agency and by activity and depended in large part on the number and duration of CRs. Agencies were largely unable to identify any specific foregone opportunities that may have resulted from a delay in hiring related to CRs, but they did describe some general effects. For example, VHA medical facilities did not start nonrecurring maintenance projects designed to improve and maintain the quality of VA Medical Centers during the CR period. during a CR. Delays resulting from CRs contributed to delays in the availability of additional prison capacity at a time when prison facilities were already overcrowded. As of July 9, 2009, BOP facilities were 37 percent over capacity systemwide. According to BOP, delaying contract awards for new BOP prisons and renovations to existing facilities prevented the agency from locking in prices and resulted in higher construction costs. Some agency officials said that contracting delays resulting from longer CRs have also affected their ability to fully compete and award contracts. Longer CRs also have contributed to distortions in agencies’ spending, adding to the rush to obligate funds late in the fiscal year before they expire. A longer CR period also may compress the application time available for discretionary grants. We reviewed the application times for 277 grants awarded by four ACF discretionary grant programs between 2005 and 2008. We found that while application times varied considerably, they were on average 11 days more in fiscal years when the agency’s regular appropriation was enacted before the end of the first quarter. during a CR to avoid having to solicit proposals multiple times. If the amount of funding provided by a formula grant is based on a certain percentage of the total amount appropriated, the grant may be delayed until the department has received its final funding. An ACF official told us that nonprofit organizations providing shelter to unaccompanied alien children have used lines of credit to bridge gaps in federal funding during a CR. In March 2009, a shelter in Texas informed ACF’s Office of Refugee Resettlement that its credit was at its lowest level. limit and it was in immediate need of additional funds to sustain operations for the next 45 to 60 days. The Office of Refugee Resettlement made an emergency grant to this organization to maintain operations with the CR funding remaining. In addition to delays described above, some agency officials told us that they delayed making program enhancements because of funding constraints related to the CR. For example, FBI officials said that over $440 million in enhancements to existing programs and activities were delayed in 2009 because the CR instructs agencies to implement only the most limited funding actions. work to manage within the constraints of the CR. The most common type of additional work that agencies reported was having to enter into new contracts or exercise contract options. Agencies often made contract awards monthly or in direct proportion to the amount and timing of funds provided by theCR. In general, shorter and more numerous CRs led to more repetitive work for agencies managing contracts than longer CRs did. Numerous shorter CRs were particularly challenging for agencies, such as VHA and BOP, that have to maintain an inventory of food, medicine and other essential supplies. ACF issues multiple grants to the same grant recipient during the CR period, officials say. The longer the CR lasts, a Head Start official said, the greater the number of grants they have to award. In 2008, 185 (about 35 percent) of Head Start Project grants administered to recipients through Head Start’s 10 regional offices received a grant during theCR period and a second grant award shortly after ACF”s regular appropriation for the year (p.4). We could not establish a clear causal link between CRs and specific instances where a grant recipient received multiple awards. An agency’s ability to shift its contract cycle depends on a number of factors, including the type of services being acquired. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 allows agencies to enter into 1-year contracts for severable services that cross fiscal years. Using this contract flexibility, an agency can shift itscontract cycle so that annual contracts for Severable services are executed in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year when agencies are less likely to be under a CR. However, some agencies’ able to shift their contract cycle to mitigate the effects of CRs was limited. to do only once had they received their regular appropriation on October 1st. FDA reported that CRs increased the amount of administrative work required to allot funds. VBA and VHA reported that they did not allot specific dollar amounts during a CR but rather provided guidance that all offices operate at a certain percentage of the previous year’s appropriations (see fig. 6). The types of administrative tasks affected by CRs varied by the agency and the type of funding it was allocated to them. agency but included the following: issuing guidance to various programs and offices; providing information to Congress and OMB; creating, disseminating, and revising spending plans; and responding to questions and requests for additional funding. Departmental CFOs and others who participated in our panel discussion said that CRs led to similar repetitive work activities at their agencies. VHA estimated that a 1-month CR results in over $1 million in lost productivity at VA medical facilities. FBI estimated that the Accounting, Budget, and Procurement Sections spent over 600 hours in 2009 on activities related to managing during the CR. Some agency officials said that a single, long-term CR allowed for better planning in the near term. Others said that operating under the specified rate for operations for a prolonged period limited their decision-making options. FBI officials reported that the number of contract requests that it receives to address emergency situations increases the longer the CR period lasts. FBI often has to reprioritize funds from other operations to fund these contracts, placing a strain on agency operations. Some agency officials also said that it was difficult to implement unexpected changes in their regular appropriations. usual budget and planning cycle, which can take several months, had be completed in just 6 weeks to meet the deadline that FBI has established for completing all of its large dollar contracts by the end of the fiscal year. Since 1999, the CR period has extended into January four times, and the cost of the salary increase has ranged from 1.7 percent to 4.1 percent (see table 1) For those agencies that ultimately receive a funding increase, absorbing the annual salary increase may strain already tight budgets. fiscal year—was helpful for managing funds in the compressed time period after regular appropriations were enacted. VBA and VHA said that having the authority to carry over funds into the next fiscal year has been helpful in years with lengthy CRs. OMB has also helped agencies manage during a CR by providing more than the automatic apportionment when justified. Two of our case study agencies, VHA and ACF, received exception apportionments during the study period—fiscal years 1999 to 2009. VHA apportioned funding for VHA’s medical administration account to reflect its seasonal rate of obligations in 2008. agencies operated with the automatically apportioned amount during CR periods since fiscal year 1999. CRs enable federal agencies to continue carrying out their missions and delivering services until agreement is reached on their regular appropriations. Agencies reported that CRs inhibited them from hiring staff and providing a higher level of service than if they were operating under a regular appropriation. When the CR period is long, the time for planning and program execution is compressed, which can be especially challenging when trying to implement new programs or program enhancements. the experiences of these six agencies provide useful insights for Congress about agency operations under CRs. We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Departments of Health and Human Services, Justice, and Veterans Affairs. The departments provided comments that were clarifying or technical in nature and we incorporated them as appropriate. This report will also be available at no charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact Denise M. Fantone at (202) 512–6806. The objectives of this report are to describe: 1. the history and characteristics of continuing resolutions (CR), and 2. how CRs have affected agency operations. To achieve our first objective, we analyzed how provisions in CRs enacted from fiscal years 1999-2009 direct agencies to operate during the CR period. Our analysis also covered the number and type of provisions inCRs that provided specific directives or funding levels to particular departments, agencies, and programs. We refer to these provisions in the report. as “legislative anomalies.” To achieve our second objective, we conducted a case study review analyzing the effects of CRs on select agency operations. In selecting case study agencies, we focused on agencies with extensive experience managing under CRs. We used a multistep process to select these departments and agencies. We eliminated from further consideration the District of Columbia because it receives significant amounts of funding outside of the regular appropriations process that may have mitigated the effect ofCRs on its operations. contracts or grants to third parties, and through the use of federal facilities. We analyzed obligations of the remaining departments based on the following four budget object class categories that were used as proxies for different types of service delivery. To maximize the usefulness of each department selected for review, we selected departments that appeared in the top three for more than one object class. Based on this analysis, the following departments were selected: VA (personnel, contractual services and acquisition); DOJ (person personnel, acquisition); and HHS (contractual services, grants). a set of criteria that were developed in part from previous GAO work. The criteria included the number of accounts, the amount of multiyear funding, whether the appropriation provided a lump sum, and whether the agency had transfer authority. Overall, our six case study agencies received more than $46 billion in discretionary budget authority in 2007, accounting for approximately 10 percent of all nondefense discretionary spending. All three of our case study departments were in the top 10 in federal contract dollars by executive department and independent agencies in 2006. related documentation for each estimate and corroborating the estimate with related interviews and other documents where possible. In general, there were too many variables for agencies to isolate the effects of CRs from other factors. ACF conducted this performance audit from September 2008 to September 2009 in accordance with generally accepted government standards. To better understand the potential effects ofCRs on entities receiving federal funding, we interviewed officials representing states and contractors, including the National Association of State Budget Officers, National Conference of State Legislatures, Federal Funds Information for States. auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Since 1999, continuing resolutions (CR) have contained the same nine standard provisions that govern most agencies, programs, and activities covered by the CR. Two new standard provisions were added during this time period, the appropriated entitlement provision and the furlough restriction. These standard provisions are listed and described in table 4. Projects or activities for which appropriations, funds, or authority were not available during the prior fiscal year. Agencies are directed to implement only the most limited funding action to continue operations at the enacted rate. Authorizes entitlements and other mandatory payments whose budget authority was provided in the prior year appropriations acts to continue at a rate to maintain program levels under current law. Amounts available for payments due on or about the first of each month after October are to continue to be made 30 days after the termination date of the CR. at different rates depending upon the status of the appropriations bill. OMB issues apportionment guidance directing agencies how to calculate the amount of funds available to obligate and spend during the CR period. The formula used to determine the apportionments has generally remained the same since fiscal year 1999. The calculation of the annualized amount will change depending on the rate for operations provided by the CR and other provisions. In figure 8, a project or activity may operate at the lower of either the rates for operations not exceeding the current rate or the rate based upon the amounts provided by House and Senate bills passed before October 1, 2005. addition to the contacts named above, Carol Henn, Julie Matta, Melissa Wolf, Sheila Rajabiun, Aglae Cantave; Juan Cristiani; Felicia Lopez; and Tom McCabe made key contributions to this report.

Summary:
Department of Defense is the world's largest owner of aircraft and aircraft engines. Of 51 types of military engines used today, 28 are generally repaired in military depots and 23 almost exclusively by contractors. In recent years, private sector firms have sought more of the military engine workload. DOD estimates that its depot repair facilities and equipment are valued at over $50 billion. The engines maintained by the private sector generally have commercial as well as military applications and support fewer aircraft and require less inventory than those maintained in the military. most of the repair of 23 other engines, which power such aircraft as the KC-10, T-38, and C-9. Most of the 28 engines maintained in DOD’s public depots are military-unique and not used in the commercial market place. Military-unique engines include the F100 engine, which powers the F-15 and F-16 aircraft. The Air Force is considering developing repair capability for the F117 engine. It is similar to the commercial engine that powers the Boeing 757 aircraft. Changes in military strategy, reductions-in-force structure, and improved engine reliability have all contributed to decreased demand for engine repair requirements. The change in war-planning scenarios from a massive, protracted war in response to a Soviet invasion to shorter duration contingency scenarios also reduced the anticipated surge requirement for depot maintenance. Between fiscal years 1985 and 1994, the services reduced their aircraft inventories from about 24,500 to 17,400. For example, the Air Force reduced its F-4 aircraft inventory from 1,597 to 61. depots in 1990. With only one exception, DOD now has only one organic depot-level repair site for each military engine. Some engines are repaired both by a military depot and one or more private sector contractors. Efforts to achieve savings included consolidation, interservicing, and competitions between government depots and the private sector. Some of these efforts were superseded by the 1993 BRAC decision to close Alameda Naval Aviation Depot.. Despite these initiatives, DOD’s engine depot repair facilities continue to have significant excess capacity. the military and industry, specifically, commercially developed aircraft turbine (jet) engines. On March 14, 1995, DOD provided the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations with its report. In its engine report, DOD reviewed 17 military engines with commercial counterparts. The report concluded that, for two reasons, no changes in workload allocation between the public and private sector were warranted. We addressed the rationale supporting the continued need for DOD to maintain capability to repair engines at its own depots, and whether there are opportunities to privatize additional engine workloads. We drew from information gathered as part of our overall review of DOD’s depot-level maintenance program. for each depot that performs engine overhauls and repairs engine components. (2) the services’ fiscal year 1997 engine workload projections for each depot in our study. (3) capacity, core workload, and workload projections used by the services to develop recommendations for the BRAC Commission. We interviewed service officials, examined documents and visited the facilities at the San Antonio Air Logistics Center, Kelly Air Force Base, and Corpus Christi Army Depot, Texas. We also visited the Oklahoma City Air Logistic Center, Tinker Air Force base, and Cherry Point Naval Aviation Depot, North Carolina. We surveyed 24 private repair activities identified as potential sources of repair. The amount of excess capacity in DOD’s depot system influences cost. Statutes require DOD to maintain a minimum level of capability as well as limit the amount of work that can be contracted out to the private sector. Public and private depot repair capabilities, capacity, and competition are key factors that impact readiness and cost, and, therefore, influence source-of-repair decisions. We used the military services’ workload projection for engine and component repair. Public-private competition is one procedure the services have used to consider the cost-effectiveness of privatizing depot maintenance work. Although the competition program is credited with significant savings, private contractors generally do not believe the program is fair. Despite the services’ claimed savings, we and DOD audit agencies found that DOD could not verify the results because of weaknesses in its accounting system and internal controls. The future of competition between public and private entities is questionable and remains uncertain, the authors say. They recommend that the Secretary of Defense reinstitute public- private competition for depot maintenance. depot maintenance workloads as quickly as possible. The degree of similarity between military and commercial engines can range from 30 percent to 100 percent. Ten military engines with commercial counterparts are now fully or predominantly maintained in the private sector. The more similarity there is between military systems and equipment and commercially available items, the greater the likelihood that private repair sources may be cost-effective as depot maintenance sources of repair, the authors say. They say the time to make such decisions is before the military invests in establishing its own depot maintenance capability. repair for military-unique engines would likely be more costly than organic repair. Key reason is that this workload is awarded on a sole-source basis to the original equipment manufacturer. We have found that most of DOD’s contract depot maintenance is awards on a noncompetitive basis and that it is difficult to control costs under these conditions. We found the greatest percent of excess engine capacity at the Corpus Christi Army Depot and Cherry Point Naval Aviation Depot and the smallest percent at the Jacksonville Naval aviation Depot. by making better use of available building space, adding some additional shifts, transferring some engine workloads to the Jacksonville Naval Aviation Depot, which repairs engines for the Navy. Public-private competitions would be required before privatizing each engine workload, since the value of each engine’s workload exceeds the $3 million threshold provision of 10 U.S.C. 2469. DOD actions show that in practice it has not reinstituted public-private competition. Our report includes a recommendation that DOD reinstitute the program and issue guidance regarding the conditions, framework, policies and procedures. Since the end of the Cold War, commercial contractors have aggressively sought more of DOD’s maintenance work. Excess capacity in the public depots may reduce the cost-effectiveness of privatizing commercial counterpart engine workloads. The opportunity appears to be most promising when two factors are present: the military engine has a high degree of similarity with its civilian counterpart and multiple repair (both public and private) sources are able to compete.

Seven engines are good candidates for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of privatization by conducting public-private competitions. The degree of similarity between military and commercial engines can range from 30 percent to 100 percent. The competitive environment that exists for these engines allows DOD to benefit from “sharing” fixed-overhead costs with the private sector customers who have substantially larger numbers of engines being serviced. For reasons previously mentioned, the TF33 and TF34 engines do not appear to be good candidate for competition. workload at the San Antonio Air Logistics Center would result in savings. We found that the Navy’s decision to equip the North Island Naval Aviation Depot to repair the LM2500 reflected the services’ reluctance to share depot maintenance. The repair costs of theLM2500 have steadily increased from $443,678 in 1990 to $925,200 in 1995. We believe the costs have increased because the LM 2500 is a relatively small workload and is the only turbine engine North Island currently repairs. not recommend closing any maintenance depots. However, the Commission found that the significant excess capacity and infrastructure in the Air Force depot system required the closure of the San Antonio center. DOD officials are developing plans to privatize workloads—including engines—in San Antonio, as part of a plan to retain over 16,000 jobs in that city. Since the remaining depots will continue to be burdened with excess capacity, moving additional engine workloads from these facilities to the private sector would only increase the fixed costs. The current policy is to maintain core capabilities in the military depot maintenance system. We believe cost-effectiveness should be a key part of this decision-making process. Privatizing additional engine work would further exacerbate the severe engine excess capacity problem and the cost of maintaining engines at the remaining military depots. The LM2500 workload can probably be performed more cost-effectively by the private sector or through consolidation with the TF39. A public-private competition would be a good choice for determining the most cost- effective source of repair for this engine.

Summary:
Taiwan's democracy is experiencing a period of rancor and instability as it undergoesa process of political maturation. The political system lacks institutions. The DPP lacksadministrative experience, many leadership postswithin the government remain filled by KMT members. The KMT, the New Party, and thePeople First Party (PFP) tend to be economically and politically conservative compared to the DPP and more inclined to consider eventual unification with China. The Nationalist Party, orKuomintang (KMT) lost the presidential election- the first time it has not ruled the Republic of China. for moderating partisanship and facilitating the transfer of power. Few formal and informal procedures andprecedents have been established for divided government. No party is expected to attain amajority in the Legislative Yuan. Most mass media in Taiwan are government- or party-affiliated and politically-biased. There are no firm indications about how Taiwan's political parties will fare in the December 2001 legislative elections. The KMT continues towield economic clout and economic clout, according to an American observer at the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei. political influence, its popularity has continued to wane for several reasons. At the end of 2000, Taiwan's stockmarket had fallen by more than 50% since Chen's election and unemployment had reached a 15-year high. Taiwanese investment in the People's Republic ofChina (PRC) nearly doubled in 2000, which resulted in the transfer of many skilled and high tech jobs to themainland. According to some estimates,non-performing loans have reached 12-17 percent of all Taiwan bank loans. exports to the United States,increasing imports from abroad if Taiwan joins theWTO, (5) greater economic competition from China,the loss of global competitive advantage of some Taiwanese export items, and falling consumer demand. Some American and Taiwanese economic analysts viewed China as the key to Taiwan's continueddevelopment. They told the delegation that the PRC'saccession to the WTO and direct trade, transportation, and communication between the mainland and Taiwan would further open China to Taiwanese investmentand exports. The platform of the DPP has long advocated independence for Taiwan. as long as the PRC did not use military forceagainst Taiwan, he would not declareindependence. Analysts have posited several factorsand considerations that may explain Chen's break from past positions and pro-independence members inhis party. Chen Shui-bian has expressed a willingness to resume cross-strait talks, but without agreeing to thePRC's "one-Chinaprinciple" as a starting point. By contrast, opposition leaders have been more accepting of the " one-China" principle as a principle. Following the March2000 presidential election, both the DPP and the KMT have taken more conciliatory stances toward the mainland. The KMT has downplayed former PresidentLee Teng-hui's suggested "state-to-state" framework for negotiations. Both put forthdemocratization on the mainland as a condition for substantive moves toward greater political ties or unification. Both partiessupport the "status quo" - a position of neither independence nor unification - for the time being. Cross-strait economic ties have grownconsiderably since the late 1980s. Bilateral trade was worth $25.8 billion in 1999, up 14.5 percent from 1998. According to PRC data, Taiwan is China's largest source of imports. Taiwanese firms have invested anestimated $40 billion in more than 40,000enterprises on the mainland. Some analysts report that business interests on both sides of the strait are pursuing greater economic cooperation in preparation forPRC and ROC accession to the WTO. tensions. Officials at the Ministry of National Defense raised several concerns. ROC defense officials asserted that a mainland military attack was possible but not likely in the short-term. Taiwanesedefense leaders argued that currently the mainland could pressure Taiwan through missile tests, shootingdown Taiwanese fighters or sinking its ships. Chinese capabilities were expected toimprove substantially over the next five years. Two trends have helped to stabilize PRC-Taiwan relations in theshort term. The development of real political competition in Taiwan has encouraged themajor parties to appeal to the center of the political spectrum. ties, which have been bolstered by the prospect of WTO membership forboth sides, have raised the economic andpolitical costs of a military conflict for Beijing and Taipei. Other factors may add to tensions in the future. PRC foreign policy mishaps or social unrest stemming from economic reforms may trigger renewed governmentemphasis on Chinese nationalism. China's military modernization also bears watching. The U.S. State Department says it has no immediate plans to engage in military exercises with Taiwan or other Asian countries.

Summary:
Program evaluations are systematic studies that use research methods to address specific questions about program performance. Evaluation can play a key role in program planning, management, and oversight by providing feedback on programs. An evaluation study can provide a valuable supplement to ongoing performance reporting by measuring results that are too difficult or expensive to assess annually. It can also explain the reasons why performance goals were not met, or assessing whether one approach is more effective than another. In particular, evaluations can be designed to isolate the causal impacts of programs from other external economic or environmental conditions in order to assess a program's effectiveness. Both program design and execution to program managers, legislative and executive branch policy officials, and the public. The PIO role was created in 2007 by executive order. GPRAMA established the role in law and specified that it be given to a “senior executive” at each agency who reports directly to the agency’s COO or to its deputy agency head. It is to advise the head of the agency and the COO on goal setting, measurement, and reviewing progress on the agency priority goals. in promoting agency use of evaluation and other evidence to improve program performance. The act also charged the Performance Improvement Council (PIC), the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and OMB with responsibilities to improve agency performance management capacity. The PIC is an interagency council that was created in the 1990s to help agencies with performance issues. The OMB is an agency that was established in the 1970s to assist agencies with their performance issues and to help them improve their effectiveness and efficiency. created by executive order, but GPRAMA established it in law. membership would include the PIOs from all 24 CFO Act agencies, as well as any others. The PIC’s duties include facilitating agencies’ exchange of successful practices and the development of tips and tools to strengthen agency performance management. In 2012 through 2014, OMB and the PIC supported several interagency forums on evaluation and evidence that were open to all federal agency staff. The act charged OPM with (1) identifying key skills. OPM identified core competencies for performance management staff, PIOs, and goal leaders and published them in a January 2012 memorandum. OMB has taken several steps to help agencies develop evaluation capacity by issuing guidance, promoting the exchange of evaluation expertise through the PIC. OPM is currently conducting pilot studies through 2015, in collaboration with the Chief Human Capital Officers Council, of how to build staff capacity in several competencies identified as mission critical across government, including data analysis. 7 of the 24 agencies have central leaders responsible for evaluation; in contrast, 7 agencies reported no recent evaluations for any of their performance goals. The GPRA provides a statutory framework for performance management and accountability across the government. Less than a third of agencies have an evaluation plan or agency-wide policies for ensuring study credibility. About half the agencies (11) reported committing resources to obtain evaluations by establishing a central office responsible for evaluating agency programs, operations, or projects. AEA guidance says a central evaluation office can promote an agency’s capacity and provide an organizational framework for planning, conducting, or procuring evaluation studies, but only about half of the agencies in total had one. GPRAMA requires OMB to provide quarterly updates on agency and cross-agency priority goals on a central, government-wide website. In our survey, PIO reviews were mixed about the utility of this website to improve agency capacity to use evaluations in decision making. While timely, public dissemination of performance and evaluation results may not directly influence agency decision making, it is important to support government transparency and accountability for results to the Congress and the public, the authors say. In the absence of explicit authority or congressional request, agencies may be reluctant to spend increasingly scarce funds on evaluation studies that are perceived as resource intensive. ways to encourage agencies to produce credible, relevant studies that inform decision making. consult with agencies on proposed revisions to their strategic plans and priority goals, as GPRAMA requires them to do every 2 years. Request agency evaluations to address specific questions about the implementation and results of major program or policy reforms, in time to consider their results in program reauthorization. Review agencies’ annual evaluation plans or agendas to ensure that they address issues that will inform budgeting, reauthorizing, and ongoing program management. We administered a web-based questionnaire from May 2, 2014, to June 19, 2014. We received responses from all 24 agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO act) Key contributors to this report are listed in appendix III.

Contacts for our Office of Congressional Relations and Office of Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. Survey gave us information about agencies’ evaluation resources, policies, and activities. We sent respondents an e-mail invitation to complete the survey on a secure GAO web server. Because this was not a sample survey, it has no sampling errors. In practice, any survey may introduce nonsampling errors that stem from differences in how a particular question is interpreted, or how the survey data are analyzed. All can introduce unwanted variability into the survey results. The survey questions and summarized results are in appendix II. science survey specialist designed the questionnaire, in collaboration with our staff who had subject matter expertise. We pretested the questionnaire in person with PIOs at three federal agencies to make sure that the questions were relevant, clearly stated, easy to comprehend, and unbiased. Since this was a web-based survey, respondents entered their answers directly into the electronic questionnaire; thus, we did not key the data. When we analyzed data from the completed survey, an independent analyst reviewed all computer programs used in our analysis. into a database, avoiding data entry errors. In reviewing the agencies’ answers, we confirmed that the PIOs had correctly bypassed inapplicable questions. We concluded from our review that the survey data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. The 24 agencies subject to the CFO Act include Agency for International Development, Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Interior, Justice, Homeland Security, Labor, State, Transportation, Social Security.

Summary:
Since 2002, the U.S. has allocated more than $72 billion for development, governance, and security in Afghanistan. The United States and international donors have increased their focus on transitioning leadership to the Afghan government. The Afghan government published a plan, called the Public Financial Management Roadmap, in July 2010. The Roadmap aims to strengthen the Afghangovernment’s performance in three key areas at the national and provincial level: budget formulation, budget execution, and accountability and transparency of financial management. The World Bank, the United Kingdom, and the United States are key donors providing assistance. CSTC-A has established a process to assess progress on key objectives and rate the capacity of MOD and MOI, in areas including finance and budget functions, on a quarterly basis. MOD has progressed from significant reliance on coalition support in 2008 to being capable of executing core functions with minimal coalition support by 2011. Progress at MOI has been slow, in part because CSTC- A’s capacity-building efforts atMOI started in 2006, several years after its efforts began at MOD in 2002. USAID’s Automated Directives System (ADS) establishes performance management and evaluation procedures USAID is expected to follow with respect to planning, monitoring, and evaluating its programs. For PFM capacity building in Afghanistan, we found a lack of compliance with USAID guidance at the mission level and at the implementing-partner level. We previously reported in July 2010 that USAID has operated without a required Mission performance management plan for Afghanistan since the end of 2008. The plan contains a results framework that includes two PFM-related objectives and several related indicators, but lacks performance targets for the indicators. The plan noted that baselines and targets for each indicator would be established in the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2011. Many indicators do not have baseline data or targets because some indicators are either new or were in the previous plan but data were never collected for them. In April 2011, donors initiated joint assessments of 14 Afghan civilian ministries, which account for 90 percent of the development budget, to establish baselines of their PFM capacity. These assessments are due by 2012, according to the plan. The performance management frameworks for PFM capacity-building projects did not meet USAID guidance because of deficiencies such as a lack of baselines, targets, and performance data. The performance indicators for EGGI and ACSS related to P FM capacity- building activities do not consistently provide baseline, performance targets, or actual performance data for each indicator, as required. We have previously reported similar deficiencies in other USAID projects in Afghanistan. We are committed to following up on USAID’s recommendations on these projects’ progress. This report examines U.S. efforts to improve the Afghan government’s public financial management (PFM) capacity. We interviewed officials from DOD, State, Treasury, and USAID in Washington, D.C., and in Kabul, Afghanistan. We reviewed documents and records from the Departments of Defense (DOD), State (State), and the Treasury (Treasury) The report also compared efforts by USAID, DOD, and Treasury with the key components of the Public Financial Management Roadmap. obtain clarifying information about performance data. Due to unexplained changes and gaps in some target and performance data, we could not verify the reliability of all performance data reported by USAID. We did not independently assess the capability of MOD and MOI finance offices. We relied on CSTC-A’s capability milestone ratings, which are used to measure the capability level of a specific area or department. We assessed data obtained for our analysis to be sufficiently reliable to provide an overall assessment of the extent to which Treasury advisers’ assistance has contributed to MOF’S PFM capacity. assistance to being capable of fully autonomous operations. Since 2002, the United States has allocated more than $72 billion for security, governance, and development to Afghanistan. The budget process in Afghanistan is highly centralized, with the Afghan national government responsible for developing and executing the country’s budget. None of the 34 Afghan provinces has the authority to raise revenues or spend public funds, according to the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) The Afghan parliament, called the National Assembly, can approve or reject the national budget in its entirety. The Combined Security Transition Command–Afghanistan (CSTC-A) has established a process to regularly assess and rate the capability of Ministries of Defense (MOD) and Interior (MOI) The assessment process uses the objectives in the Ministerial Development Plan as criteria to assess progress in capacity building at the ministries. MOD advisers complete an online survey to provide information about the scope and quality of their interaction with their Afghan counterparts on a quarterly basis. The assessment and rating is based on interviews with advisers and Afghan officials, internal quarterly assessments, and other officials’ reporting. CSTC-A does not currently use adviser surveys for MOI, but is in the process of developing and implementing these. Figures below show fiscal years 2010 and 2011 performance data for U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) projects that focus significantly on public financial management (PFM) capacity building at the national and provincial level. to reinforce and set the current and following quarter’s objectives and initiatives.

Summary:
From 1995 through 2002, WTO members brought 198 formal dispute settlement cases against other members. About one-third (64) of all WTO cases involved members’ trade remedies. The United States has been by far the most frequent defendant in trade remedy cases but relatively less active in filing complaints. U.S. agency officials say it is not surprising that the United States had been a defendant more often than a complainant in WTO disputes since it has the world’s biggest economy and most desirable market. Two U.S. laws, one regulation, and three practices were changed or are subject to change. In the 11 cases involving other WTO members, only one practice was subject to changes. The two laws are the Antidumping Act of 1916 and a section of the Tariff Act of 1930. The three changes involved a revision of the “arm’s- length” methodology in antidumping cases and two privatization methodologies that the Commerce Department used in countervailing duty cases. Most of the rulings in the 25 completed trade remedy cases involved a case-specific removal or revision of a WTO member’s trade remedy measure. In the 14 completed cases brought against the United States, 21 U.S. trade measures were subject to revision or removal. The 11 completed cases against other countries resulted in 7 trade measures being subject to revise or removal, as shown in table 2. The United States reduced antidumping margins on measures in response to 3 WTO rulings, removed countervailing duty measures in 1 case as a result of domestic litigation. U.S. officials indicated that some WTO rulings were confusing and difficult to implement. Officials said they are monitoring WTO rulings and recommendations in cases not involving the United States. They are preparing for similar, potential challenges against the U.S., they said. The U.N. trade agency says it has no immediate comment on the report's findings. The report was published by the World Trade Organization's Antidumping and Safeguards Committee. It is the first report of its kind to be released by the committee. The U.S. agencies most involved in trade remedy activities believe that article 17.6(ii) has been improperly applied in some trade remedy cases. A significant minority of experts with whom we spoke said the WTO was not properly applying the legal standard of review in the Antidumping Agreement. Despite the concerns above, the majority of the experts indicated that the panels and the Appellate Body had generally had their authority in applying the standards of review, the authors say. The authors say the issue of how the WTO has resolved important trade remedy issues is highly controversial in the United States. In its December 2002 report to Congress, the executive branch concluded that, overall, the United States had fared well in WTO dispute settlement. Nevertheless, the report raised concerns about how the WTO had applied standard of review in trade remedy cases. The report specifically criticized the Appellate Body ruling in United States—Antidumping Measures on Certain Hot-Rolled Steel Products from Japan for how it had applied the legal standard ofreview in article 17.6(ii). In its submission, the U.S. stated that panels have not accepted WTO members’ reasonable, permissible interpretations of the Antidumping Agreement. We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Secretary of Commerce, the Chairman of the U.S. International Trade Commission, and the US Trade Representative. The Commerce Department and the ITC provided written comments, which are reprinted in appendixes IV and V. The ITC had two main areas of concern regarding the report. It said that the report understated the full effect of WTO rulings on the ability of the United States to impose and maintain trade remedy measures. As a result, we modified our report to give more prominent treatment to U.s. agency positions. have properly applied the standard of review in article 17.6(ii) of the Antidumping Agreement. In response to this concern, we have incorporated the ITC’s views in our report. USTR provided technical comments such as clarification of certain terminology. For example, USTR noted that the term “domestic determination” usually connotes a final decision by the appropriate agency as to whether dumping has occurred or whether increased imports have caused injury or are threatening injury to domestic industry. GAO conducted a review of the World Trade Organization’s dispute settlement activity during the past 8 years. The report will be available at no charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov. To obtain the number 198 for formal dispute settlement cases filed with the WTO from 1995 through 2002, we combined multiple complaints against one WTO member on the same law, measure, or action into one distinct case. We excluded challenges to WTO members’ sunset reviews in our data on trade remedy measures in response to agency comments. In June 1994, Brazil initiated a countervailing duty (CVD) investigation to determine whether imports of desiccated coconut and coconut milk from Côte d’Ivoire, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka had been subsidized. The Philippines challenged the Brazilian CVDs under various provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Agriculture. Brazil’s principal argument was that none of the WTO provisions relied upon by the Philippines applies in this case because the Brazilian subsidy investigation was initiated on the basis of an application received before the WTO Agreement entered into force. on CVD investigations did not apply because this dispute involved application of a Brazilian CVD measure based on an investigation initiated prior to January 1, 1995. Mexico challenged both the initiation of Guatemala’s antidumping investigation of imports of grey portland cement from Mexico. The Appellate Body found that Guatemala had failed to comply with article 5.3 of the ADA by initiating the antidumping. investigation on the basis of insufficient evidence of dumping, injury, and casual link between dumping and injury. Korea reported to the WTO that it had effectively terminated the safeguard measure on imports of the dairy products on May 20, 2000. The EU argued that Korea’s safeguard measure was inconsistent with various provisions of the Safeguards Agreement as well as article XIX:1 of GATT 1994. The Appellate Body also reversed a panel finding on the issue of “unforeseen developments” Accordingly, it recommended that Korea bring its safeguard measure into conformity with thesafeguards agreement. By lifting the safeguard measure, Korea considers that it has implemented the recommendations and rulings of the Dispute Settlement Body. Korea challenged the U.S.’s failure to revoke an antidumping order on Korean dynamic random access memory semiconductors (DRAMS) of one megabyte or above. The parties did not appeal the panel findings. The United States deleted the “not likely’ criterion from its regulation and replaced it with a requirement that the Secretary of Commerce consider whether the continued application of the antidumping duty order is otherwise necessary to offset dumping. The EU challenged Argentina’s imposition of safeguards on imports of EU footwear. The safeguard measure took the form of minimum specific duties on these imports. The EU contended that the safeguard measure violated article XIX:1(a) of GATT 1994 and various provisions of the Safeguards Agreement. United States and Korea then notified the DSB of a mutually agreed- upon solution to the dispute, and the compliance panel proceeding was terminated. The Appellate Body upheld panel findings that Argentina's safeguard investigation and determinations of increased imports, serious injury, and causation were inconsistent with articles 2 and 4 of thesafeguards agreement. Poland challenged Thailand’s imposition of antidumping duties on imports of certain Polish steel products. The Appellate Body affirmed the panel's findings that Thailand had violated the ADA. Mexico challenged the U.S. imposition of duties on two grades of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) from the United States. The panel recommended that the DSB request that Mexico bring its antidumping measure into conformity with its obligations under the ADA, but Mexico revoked the measure in May 2002. Japan and the EU separately challenged section 801 of the Revenue Act of 1916 (1916 Act) Section 801 allows for private claims against, and criminal prosecutions of, parties that import or assist in importing goods into the United States at a price substantially less than actual market value or wholesale price. The Appellate Body affirmed the panel conclusions that antidumping legislation, including the 1916 Act, can be directly challenged, absent any particular application. It also upheld the panel findings that the 1915 Act itself was inconsistent with article VI of GATT 1994 and various provisions of the ADA. The United States continues to work to enact legislation to implement the WTO ruling. A number of bills have been introduced in the Congress calling for repeal of section 801 of the 1916 Act. As of July 15, 2003, the latest bills were H.R. 1073, S. 1080, and S. 1155. The bills are somewhat different in that the repeals would not affect pending cases, whereas the S.1080 repeal would apply to them. The United States imposed CVDs on imports of certain hot-rolled lead and bismuth carbon steel products originating in the United Kingdom. granted to British Steel Corporation, a state-owned company, between 1977 and 1986. The EU claimed that the U.S. methodology in calculating the amount of these subsidies was inconsistent with several provisions of the WTO SCM Agreement. The Appellate Body upheld the panel finding that the financial contributions provided to British. Steel did not confer a benefit on the new owners. In doing so, the panel found that a certain proportion of the subsidies granted to. British Steel had passed through to the new entities. faulted the Commerce Department’s methodology in presuming that a benefit had been provided to the new owners. It found that the U.S. CVDs were inconsistent with the SCM Agreement and recommended that the DSB request that the United States bring its measures into conformity with its obligations under that agreement. The panel suggested that the. United States take all appropriate steps, including revision of its administrative practices, to prevent a violation of the SC.M Agreement, but the Appellate Body did not make this specific recommendation. India argued that the imposition of antidumping duties was inconsistent with various provisions of the ADA. One of the principal issues involved the EU’s practice of zeroing in calculating antidumping margins. After the DSB adopted the Appellate Body report, the EU established lower dumping margins for Indian imports of bed linens. Although it also concluded that dumped imports from India were still causing material injury to the EU industry,. the EU suspended application of the duties for these imports. Although the panel in the article 21.5 proceeding determined that the EU had implemented the recommendation of the D SB, the Appelliate Body reversed and found the EU was still acting inconsistently. In 1999, Mexico challenged Guatemala’s imposition of an antidumping measure on imports of portland cement from Mexico. In its challenge, Mexico contended that the initiation and conduct of the antidumping investigation and the imposition of the measure violated article VI of GATT 1994 and various provisions of the ADA. The Appellate Body reversed the panel and found that the dispute was not properly before the panel. In December 2000, Guatemala informed the WTO that it had removed the antidumped measures in question and complied with its recommendations. Australia and New Zealand challenged a U.S. safeguard measure imposed on imports of fresh, chilled, and frozen lamb meat from New Zealand and Australia. The measure was in the form of a tariff rate quota that was to span 3 years. The Appellate Body found that the United States safeguard measure was applied inconsistently with the Safeguards Agreement and GATT 1994. In August 2001, the United states decided to end the application of the safeguard measure. The safeguard measure expired in June 2001. Korea challenged several aspects of the U.S. antidumping investigation and measures on imports of stainless steel plate in coils (plate) and stainless steel sheet and strip (sheet) from Korea. The panel found several parts of the investigation to be inconsistent with the ADA. As of April 2003, the antidumping orders were still in effect. According to officials from the Commerce Department, the United States made some revisions in its calculation of dumping margins in this case. The Appellate Body also made important statements about the standard of review in article 17.6 of theADA. calculations, the dumping margins for all three companies and all others were reduced. The United States also revised its rules regarding its arm’s-length test to determine if sales are “in the ordinary course of trade” The U.S. and Japan agreed to extend the deadline for implementation to December 2003, or until the end of the first session of the next Congress, whichever is earlier. The EU claimed that the antidumping measures were inconsistent with various provisions of the ADA. financial contributions, and thus potential subsidies, in violation of the SCM Agreement. Canada argued that export restraints could result in providing subsidies to other products that used or incorporated the restricted product. Canada’s challenge was only to U.S. legal measures and not to a particular instance in which an export restraint had been the subject of a CVD investigation. The panel found against Canada and concluded that U.s. CVD law is not inconsistent with the SCm Agreement. In addition, the panel suggested that three of the legal measures Canada contested could not be challenged independently of the relevant U.N. statute. Korea challenged the U.S. imposition of a safeguard measure on imports of certain line pipe from Korea. The safeguard measure that was imposed was in the form of a duty increase for 3 years. The measure applied to imports from all WTO members except Canada and Mexico. In July 2002, the United States and Korea agreed on several steps to implement the recommendations of the DSB. No compliance action was necessary. The panel findings were not appealed. The Appellate Body reversed the panel on one of its injury findings, which resulted in upholding a United States determination. Argentina made two distinct challenges to Chilean restrictions on imports of Argentine wheat, wheat flour, sugar, and edible vegetable oils. Argentina challenged both Chile’s price band system, which Chile applied to calculate tariff rates on these imports, and its imposition of safeguard measures. The panel determined that Chile had violated various provisions of the Safeguards Agreement and GATT 1994. But the panel did not make a recommendation regarding removal of the safeguard measures because they had been removed before the panel published its report. Turkey challenged Egypt’s imposition of antidumping duties on imports of steel rebar from Turkey. The panel upheld 19 determinations of the Egyptian investigating authority, but found that Egypt had violated articles 3.4 and 6.8 of the ADA. The EU claimed that a provision of U.S. countervailing law—section 771(5)(F)—violated the SCM Agreement. Chile's compliance with regard to its price band system involves the WTO Agreement on Agriculture. The panel found that where a privatization is at arm’s length and for fair market value, the benefit from a prior subsidy to a state-owned enterprise is not passed on to the privatized entity. The Appellate Body reversed the panel and found that section 771(5)(F) of the Tariff Act of 1930 was consistent with the SCM Agreement. On June 23, 2003, the Commerce Department published in the Federal Register its final modification to its privatization practice. European Union (EU) challenged provisions of U.S. countervailing law and regulations. Appellate Body upheld panel findings that laws were consistent with SCM Agreement. Canada directly challenged section 129(c)(1) of the U.N. Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) Canada failed to establish that section 129 (c) is inconsistent with WTO rules. No compliance action was necessary. The panel findings were not appealed. The United States agreed to implement the panel’s finding on the likelihood of continuation or recurrence of subsidization. Canada claimed U.S. law and regulations concerning expedited and administrative reviews of CVD orders were inconsistent with the SCM Agreement and Article VI of GATT 1994. Panel upheld the United States on several issues, but found methodology the Commerce Department used to determine the subsidy benefit was inconsistent. The panel findings were not appealed. The United States notified the DSB that the CVD measures challenged by Canada were no longer in effect and that the provisional cash deposits were not in effect, the panel said. had been refunded. Canada, however, argued that Commerce’s final determination was substantially unchanged and subsequently brought another WTO complaint challenging that determination. The WTO panel's decision in that case is due to be made public around the time this report is issued. The data clearly indicate there have been few changes in WTO members’ laws, regulations, and practices to date. The Commerce Department raised concerns regarding the composition of the group of legal experts we consulted. We believe that our methodology for selecting these experts as outlined in appendix I is sound. views on article 17.6(ii) in the report’s section on expert views and U.S. agencies’ positions. In addition to those named above, Jason Bair, Josey Ballenger, Sharron Candon, Martin De Alteriis, Rona Mendelsohn, Mary Moutsos, Mark Speight, and Laura Turman made key contributions to this report.

Summary:
Employers have been the driving force behind the growing move to compare health care providers and plans on the basis of their performance. Health plans have been publishing reports comparing their performance to their peers or to a national standard. State governments have published comparative information, often focused on specific procedures performed in hospitals. Although the federal government was responsible for the first widespread public disclosure of hospital performance data in 1987, it discontinued this practice in 1993. As a payer of health care services on behalf of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) lags behind others in making performance data public. In 1989, a group of employers initiated one of the most significant efforts to identify uniform and standardized performance indicators. This effort resulted in the creation of a performance measurement system known as the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) Using HEDIS as a base, some employers have begun to distribute to their employees educational materials that include outcome measures. The California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) recently distributed to its employees a performance report about the health plans it offers. Some employers are using third-party health care accrediting organizations to measure health plan performance. Employers are requiring the health plans they contract with to be accredited by organizations such as NCQA and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. Health plans have published comparative information intended to assist individual consumers in their health care choices and health care providers in their quality improvements. For example, in 1993, Kaiser Permanente Northern California. For. example, a consortium of employers has elected to exclude a Florida HMO from new business with. its employer-sponsored health plans because of the HMO’s failure to obtain accreditation. Health plans have been exploring new ways to make information readily available. Kaiser was one of the first health plans to publish this kind of information. HealthPartners, Inc., will initiate a consumer-oriented program using touch-screen computers. The program will allow employees to obtain details about any of the plans’ primary care sites, such as its physicians’ credentials, on-site services offered, and specialists to which its physicians refer. (See fig. 1 for more information on this program) HealthPartners will furnish data about each care system to help plan members make a decision about which one to join. Currently these data include preventive screening rates and patient satisfaction measures. HealthPartners anticipates expanding the availability of touch-screen computers to more public spaces, such as shopping malls. The states have also been active in providing information about provider performance to the public. For example, Pennsylvania has released four report cards on the hospitals and physicians in the state performing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) since 1992. In 1987, HCFA initially publically released hospital mortality information, but did so only in response to a request under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) The published information included the observed and expected mortality rates for Medicare beneficiaries in each hospital that performed CABG surgery. HCFA published the information annually until 1993, when the HCFA Administrator discontinued the reports. He cited problems with the reliability of HCFA’s methods to adjust the data to account for the influence of patient characteristics. HCFA has been participating with NCQA and the American Public Welfare Association on behalf of the State Medicaid Agencies Directors Group. In July 1995 the work group released the first draft of Medicaid HEDIS and is expected to release a final version of the document in Fall 1995 after considering comments received. The Foundation for Accountability (FAcct), created in June 1995, is a more recent public/private initiative that includes some of the major employers involved in developing H EDIS. Like HEDis, many of the most recent initiatives to provide data involve a partnership between private and public players. nation’s largest employers and HCFA, together representing more than 80 million people, agreed to combine their expertise and purchasing power. This action grew out of employer frustration with current performance data that focus on plan and provider structure and process rather than outcomes of care. FAcct intends to recommend measures of health care quality that can be easily understood by the general public so that people can make informed decisions when choosing a health plan. It also hopes to encourage the common adoption of these standards to establish uniformity and minimize health plan reporting burdens. information consumers would actually use. Employers have been the primary users of information comparing quality of care; little is known about the extent to which this information is meeting individual consumers’ needs. In 1994, we reported that while performance measures or report cards could be a useful tool to educate consumers about the health care that plans provide. In 1995, NCQA reported that almost all consumers participating in focus groups stated that they would use better evaluative information if it were available to them. those we interviewed told us they are not using the information because they are unaware that it exists, they have not been able to find it in some markets, or they believe the available information does not meet their needs. Further, they stated that the information would be more useful if their concerns about the reliability and validity of the information were addressed. “We’d like to get some kind of value-based decision for purchasing health care. The pure pricing arrangements, the deals . . . have not really been a complete answer for us,” one said. Employers use comparative data as a “red flag,” signaling a possible decline in quality. Employers use data to influence providers and plans to improve quality. Consumers, both corporate and individual, questioned whether procedure-specific data were properly adjusted to account for differences in patient characteristics that might contribute to adverse outcomes. Experts have varying beliefs about what information should be included in a report card because of acknowledged difficulties with the reliability and validity of data sources and systems designed to measure quality, authors say. “It is up to the patient to place that value. Is it more important that I be alive but it’s okay if I’d rather die than be ?” “I think that a big part of the problem, and we’re guilty of it too, is imposing our own tastes or beliefs on other people,” he says. “In health care we do a lot of deciding of what's good for people on the basis of our own beliefs, and the issues that a $9 an hour person are not the same ones that I'm contending with.” Individual consumers questioned the objectivity of the health care data produced and distributed by the provider or plan. One individual stated that “an unscrupulous provider could make sure they hit home runs on all of these particular items [the quality measurements]” These respondents saw the purpose of the reports as a provider’s public relations effort to “blow its own horn” or use the report as a “marketing tool” rather than to provide information to the consumer. Both employers and individual consumers want information that emphasizes outcomes rather than process or structure measures of quality. Few employers are sharing unpublished data with employees, and they differ from one another on whether or not they believe their employees would use it to make decisions. Consumers are asking for a measure that allows them to select providers who will improve their health status or that of their employees. For example, in describing the need for outcome data, one employer stated that they want information on the outcome of health care provided. that rather than just knowing how many women received mammography screening for breast cancer, he wanted to know if the number of women who died or were incapacitated from breast cancer was being reduced. A major northeastern food manufacturer used outcomes to relate quality assurance in health care to its manufacturing quality assurance program. A large West Coast employer stated that what the company really wants is information on health status. “We’d like to know that the plan has improved the health status of the population served,” the company said. for quality and you’re looking for value, so maybe more of a functional analysis. There is some subjective information that needs to be obtained along with the length of stay and cost of stay. You need to do a kind of functional analysis as well, to say 30 days after that angioplasty was that patient back at work, and were they working 40 hours per week? How’s your quality of life after you've had this?” “The number one thing people ask . . . when they're considering an HMO is ‘What if I get sick, am I going to die, are they going to take care of me?'” individual consumers stated that the way the information was presented was very important to them. Some wanted to have providers or plans compared side-by-side on one or two pages. Consumers using the procedure-specific reports uniformly praised the table format that provided this kind of direct comparison. Some said the government should prescribe some standards and force providers to adhere to these standards in the publishing of information. It is very difficult to know whether outcomes result from quality of care or factors such as the patient’s condition or lifestyle choices. individual consumers wanted the information to cover a wider geographic area. Some Pennsylvania consumers stated that the report card for that state pertained only to providers in Pennsylvania. Consumers living in Philadelphia would like to have had this type of information for surrounding states because their providers, while close to their homes, were located in other states. The same concern came up in a midwestern city that bordered two states. “I want to have a tool for the employees to make that decision. If the employees are making that decision, they are going to change the marketplace,” one consumer said. alter their practices because of the information that has been gathered and is presented and understood by employees. “I’ve been in health care benefits for 15 years. I don’t know how to make the choice. What happens to poor Harry the Huffer working on the shop floor when you give him . . .” “If we are going to have value-based purchasing, we have to involve consumers who make the ultimate choice. Therefore the information has to be relevant for them.” Employees disagreed with those employers who said that employees would not use the information. Most of the individual consumers who had requested the published reports found them to be easy to understand. Data comparing health care plans and providers helped the consumers we interviewed make their health care purchasing decisions. Consumers said they needed more reliable and valid data, more readily available and standardized information, and a greater emphasis on outcome measures. We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional committees and other interested parties. We will make copies available to others on request. To obtain information on how consumers use data comparing the quality of health care providers or health plans, we interviewed both employers and individual consumers. We interviewed officials at over 60 businesses, ranging in size from under 5 employees to over 100,000 employees. We also interviewed a major private sector management consulting firm that supplies comparative health care data to employers. To obtain the views of individual consumers who had received a report card, we conducted telephone interviews during January, February, and March 1995 with 153 consumers. more than one health insurance plan to choose from when making their health care insurance purchasing decisions. The number of participants in each group ranged from 8 to 10 and included employees with varying marital, family, and age status as well as employees enrolled in both indemnity and managed care plans.

==================== [82/100] ====================
Summary:
The New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) was established in response to a requirement in the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act of 1972. NCAP provides consumers with information regarding the crashworthiness of new cars beyond the applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards with which all vehicles sold in the United States must comply. In fiscal year 2004, NCAP conducted 85 crash tests and 36 rollover tests, with a budget of $7.7 million. NHTSA’s policy, although not required by law, has been to make changes to the safety standards before considering changes to NCAP. The full frontal crash test is equivalent to two identical vehicles moving toward each other at 35 mph. The angled side crash test simulates an intersection collision in which one moving vehicle strikes another moving vehicle. The rollover test is actually a series of four runs, two left/right tests and two right/left tests, at two different steering wheel angles and different speeds. NHTSA separately rates the frontal, side, and rollover tests. It assigns one (worst) to five (best) stars to communicate the results. NCAP and the three foreign programs performed their side tests using a moving deformable barrier with a front end simulating a passenger car. Insurance Institute’s barrier simulates the front end of a typical pickup truck or SUV. The Insurance Institute barrier weighs about 3,300 pounds (1,500 kilograms—kg) compared to the U.S. barrier and 2,095 pounds (950 kg) for the Australian, European, and Japanese barriers. The pole side test involves a side impact to a vehicle placed on a platform and propelled into a stationary cylindrical pole. Each vehicle testing organization used crash dummy readings as a principal part of its rating process. NHTSA officials said they use these measures because they are the most important indicators of serious or fatal injury in frontal and side crashes. The four organizations we reviewed used more dummy measures in calculating a vehicle’s safety rating than U.S. NCAP. In Europe and Australia, rating scores can be modified depending on the existence or absence of certain safety features, the report says. The Insurance Institute hopes this test will encourage manufacturers to install side curtain air bags that extend low enough to protect smaller passengers. All programs except the U.S. NCAP observe or measure changes to various parts of the occupant compartment after the frontal crash test. Japan has established fixed measures that if exceeded will result in a lower score in a particular area. Another basic difference in scoring vehicles is the use of a modifier system in Europe and Australia. This system adjusts the score generated from the dummy injury data where injuries to occupants can be expected to be worse than indicated by the dummy readings or the vehicle deformation data alone. All programs used stars to convey test results, except for the Insurance Institute. Officials from the NCAPs noted that star ratings are well understood by the public. NHTSA officials said they used focus groups in 1993 to examine various options to communicate crash test results to the public, and the five-star rating was found preferable. None of the programs has plans to change its rating measures, according to the NHTsa. The National Academy of Sciences noted that stars are inherently positive symbols and the public understands them. Australia, Europe, and Japan NCAPs provide summary ratings. The U.S. NCAP provides only individual ratings for each seating position that is included in the test for the frontal and side crash tests. Australian and European officials explained that they believed potential potential customers may not understand the distinctions between the different levels of stars. The Insurance Institute said it considered these types of qualitative measures as being clearer to the general public. It said most people would associate the star rating with hotels and that staying in a three-star hotel would be quite acceptable to most people. Vehicle purchasers can be confused by the large amount of detail available on the test results and that summarizing results makes the ratings more useful. NHTSA officials noted that overall or summary ratings might hide or mask deficiencies in some areas of the tests. For example, they said that if a vehicle were to get a very high frontal rating and a very low side rating, merging the results could give consumers a misleading impression of the overall safety of that vehicle. Similarly, officials with publications like Consumer Reports and The Car Book told us they have found it helpful to provide consumers with summarized rating information. The Internet was the most relied-upon source for getting information to consumers. Each organization made the results of its testing program available on the Internet. Some programs also work with the news media to increase awareness of test results. Euro NCAP uses color-coded dummy injury diagrams to display how the specific body regions perform in the frontal, side, pole, and pedestrian tests. The level of government and industry involvement varies among the crash test programs. programs we examined used a variety of approaches to share safety results with the public. a matter of agency policy and follows an informal rulemaking process where industry and other interested parties can submit comments. The Insurance Institute, which is funded by private insurance companies, has no such process and can make an internal decision to modify tests at any time. In Australia and Europe, NCAP officials told us that by not being exclusively controlled by government, they have flexibility when modifying their programs. They said that as a result they can make changes quicker because they do not have to follow governmental procedures. NHTSA is upgrading its frontal and side crash tests in the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Automakers told us that vehicle safety and NCAP test results have become an important marketing tool. There are now more than 85 million pickups, minivans, and SUVs on the road. The change in vehicle fleet presents new safety challenges that NCAP’s testing does not fully address—vehicle incompatibility and rollover. Without addressing these changes, NCAP provides little incentive to manufacturers to continue to improve safety. Some safety experts say NHTSA could improve its program by developing an overall safety rating. Consumer Reports, The Car Book, the Insurance Institute, and all of the other NCAPs provide more summary information for consumers. Australia and Japan provide more comparative information by supplementing their star ratings by adding bar charts that show how well the vehicle performed in the tests. It could provide summary ratings, present information in a comparative manner, increase public awareness, and make results available earlier in the model year. uses the Internet, brochures, and press releases to inform the public of NCAP ratings. The Euro NCAP also stages a public display of crash vehicles. Recent events were held in Wenceslas Square, Prague; Athens; and London. There have also been proposals to increase public awareness ofNCAP results by requiring their inclusion on new car stickers. For example, S. 1072, a bill introduced in the 108th Congress to reauthorize funds for NCAP was introduced. NCAP ratings are often released late in the model year, after many of the vehicles have already been purchased. NHTSA could conduct vehicle tests earlier and release NCAP ratings sooner. Consumer advocate groups say they support such an approach because consumers would have information available at the time of their purchase decisions. The usefulness of the current testing has been eroded by changes in the vehicle fleet that have occurred since the program began, authors say.- frontal side-impact safety ratings, four- and five-star frontal-impact ratings do not provide enough incentive for manufacturers to improve safety. To rate a vehicle’s crashworthiness, NHTSA combines information about (1) the forces that would injure a human during a crash and (2) the effects of those forces on areas of the human body. The forces of impact are measured by anthropomorphic test devices, commonly referred to as crash test dummies, which serve as proxies for human vehicle occupants. These dummies are fitted with accelerometers and load sensors that measure the forces of hit on particular areas of their bodies. The Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) ranks injuries, from minor through currently untreatable, for particular areas. NHTSA develops crashworthiness ratings, expressed in stars, for both frontal and side crashes. NHTSA calculates the probability of severe injury to the head and chest for both the driver and the front passenger dummies in the frontal NCAP test. The Thoracic Trauma Index score and its associated probability of receiving an AIS level 4 or greater injury is the sole basis for the side NCAP star rating. NTHSA assigns a vehicle a rating of one (the worst) to five (the best) stars for each of the dummy occupants. initiating commands for the programmable steering controller, which actually maneuvers the vehicles. Outriggers are attached to the vehicle to prevent the vehicle from tipping all the way over. The result of the dynamic rollover test is either “tip-up” or “no tip-up.” The general steering parameters are 270 degrees ( about a three-quarters turn) for the initial turn and 540 degrees (about one and one-half turn) For the correction turn, as shown in figure 39. NHTSA first began to rate vehicles’ rollover avoidance in model year 2001. NHTSA now links the SSF and the risk of rollover using a nonlinear model. A vehicle’s rollover rating is an estimate of its risk of rolling over in a single-vehicle crash, not a prediction of the likelihood of a rollover crash. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety recommends that vehicles with a high SSF be rated as more likely to roll over than those with a low SSF. Safety is a nonprofit research and communications organization funded by the U.S. auto insurance industry. The Insurance Institute began crash testing and rating vehicles for frontal collisions in 1995 and for side collisions in 2003. Insurance Institute officials told us that scrutinizing the outcomes of both controlled tests and on-the-road crashes gives researchers and the public a better idea of how and why vehicle occupants are injured in crashes. This research, in turn, leads to vehicle designs that reduce injuries. It also chooses the vehicles for crash tests directly from dealers. The Insurance Institute tests vehicles in categories, such as small cars, minivans, and midsize SUVs. The offset frontal test is conducted at about 40 mph to simulate a typical head-on collision of two vehicles. The perpendicular side test measures the impact of a moving deformable barrier striking the driver’s side of a passenger vehicle at 31 mph. The Insurance Institute uses a frontal impact dummy, called the 50th percentile Hybrid III dummy, to measure the risk of injury. A vehicle’s side crash test performance and overall rating are based on the injury measures recorded on the two instrumented SID-IIs dummies. The injury measures are used to determine the likelihood that the driver, the passenger, or both would have sustained serious injury to various body regions. Measures are recorded from the head, neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, and leg. The overall side rating depends on the risk of injury measured for small female occupants mainly to the head and neck. based on the injury measures recorded on the two SID-IIs dummies, is the lowest rating scored for any injury within that region. The Insurance Institute’s rating system provides qualitative ratings of Good, Acceptable, Marginal, and Poor. Figure 44 shows how the Insurance Institute presented its ratings to consumers in its Status Report. The print version is available only to subscribers, and some of the publications can can can some of these publications can be found online and on TV. The Australian New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) provides information for consumers. The main purposes of the program are to provide new vehicle buyers with independent advice. The program also uses European NCAP (Euro NCAP) crash test results. In 2004, the Australia NCAP performed three crash tests and a pedestrian protection test. in Australia and New Zealand. The Insurance Institute of Australia’s crash test report can be downloaded from the Insurance Institute”s Web site. For confidential support, call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or see www.samaritans.org. by a post-crash inspection and by viewing a high-speed video recorded from various angles during the crash test. For example, according to Australia NCAP officials, air bag performance could be compromised by the dynamics of a crash. Each body region receives a score based on the dummy measurements, the vehicle deformation data, and the findings of the post-Crash inspection (using modifiers). For example,. excessive rearward movement of the steering wheel could lower the head score by a point to reflect identified risks. Other modifiers include lack of air bag stability, steering column movement, A-pillar movement, structural integrity. Scores are based on injury measurements recorded on one EuroSID-II dummy positioned in the front driver’s seat. The injury assessment evaluates four body regions: the head, ribs, abdomen, and pelvis. A post-crash inspection and high-speed video are also used to evaluate structural collapse. Sixteen points can be achieved in the frontal test and 18 points in the side tests, for a maximum of 34 points. If a vehicle has head-protecting side air bags, the manufacturer of the vehicle has the option of accepting a side impact pole test. Australia NCAP began summarizing full frontal and offset frontal head, chest, and leg test results. In November 1999, to align with the Euro NCAP, the Australia NCAP first used a five-star system to report crash test performance. The European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) provides information for consumers with an assessment of the safety performance of some new vehicles sold in Europe. The program is operated and funded by a consortium of six European governments and motoring and consumer organizations. The three crash tests are the 40 percent offset frontal test, the perpendicular side-impact test, and the side- Impact pole test. The frontal test involves a moving test vehicle traveling at 40 mph (64 km/h) crashing into an offset deformable aluminum barrier where 40 percent of the vehicle’s width engages the barrier on the driver's side. The pedestrian protection test evaluates the impact of dummy parts against the bumper, hood, and windshield areas of a vehicle. The Euro NCAP bases its assessment of crashworthiness on three types of observations made during or after a crash test. The Japan NCAP began testing vehicles in 1995, starting with a full frontal collision test. The program added the side-impact test in 1999 and the offset frontal test in 2000. By 2004, the program had evaluated 79 vehicles representing over 80 percent of those that were on the market at that time. Ratings for 60 of these vehicles were carried over from previous years’ testing, and ratings for 19 vehicles were based on tests performed in 2003. In 2005, the institute plans to open a new test facility with multiple tracks. A EuroSID-I dummy is placed in the driver’s seat. This dummy is the same height as the Hybrid III dummy but weighs about 20 pounds less. The dummy was designed to measure the risk of injury to the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. The Japan NCAP conducts a braking performance test that measures how far a vehicle travels before it stops and how stable it is at the time of braking when it is stopped abruptly. The test is performed under wet and dry road conditions for a vehicle. To ensure consistent testing, Japan NCAP officials said, the dry road surface temperature must be 95.0 degrees plus or minus 18.0 degree Fahrenheit. The wet road surface must be 80.6 degrees and the temperature of the road surface affects the distance it takes to stop the vehicle. Professional drivers conduct the tests, and the speed of the vehicle and force with which the drivers depress the brake pedal are monitored electronically to ensure consistency. All braking tests must be performed at the same location because road surfaces vary and surface differences could affect test results. Japan NCAP assesses and scores the ease with which doors can be opened and the dummies removed after a crash test. The pedestrian test measures the effect of a pedestrian being hit by a vehicle traveling at about 22 mph if the pedestrian’s head strikes part of the hood or windshield. The Japan NCAP measures injuries to the head, neck, chest, and upper (femur) and lower (tibia) The test is conducted on vehicles with three different body types, as shown in table 10. The Japan NCAP measures injuries to the driver’s head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Points vary by body region, from 2 points for upper and lower leg injuries to 4 points for head, neck, or chest injuries. The maximum score that a vehicle can achieve is 12 points because of the way the injuries are weighted. For the pedestrian test, a series of head injury scores is used to assign injury probability levels from 5 (the best) to 1 (the worst) Child seats are evaluated according to their performance in a collision and their ease of use. Cars with hoods that are more flexible and compress upon impact can receive better scores than those that are rigid and leave no room between the hood and the engine for the impact to be absorbed. For the collision test, overall ratings of Excellent, Good, Normal, and Not Recommended are assigned. The ratings are primarily based on the head and chest injury scores taken from the dummies used in the test. For each area, the specialists assigned points, from 5 (the best) to 1 (the worst) The Japan NCAP uses a four-letter system to rate vehicles’ crashworthiness. Many vehicles have achieved a five-star rating, and some have received a six- star rating for occupant protection. In addition to the star ratings, the JapanNCAP reports the percentage of possible points that each vehicle received and provides a bar chart indicating how well the vehicles performed in these tests. Although not shown as part of the crashworthiness rating, the ratings for the pedestrian tests are provided, as well as rescueability. the ratings for the child restraint seats (Excellent, Good, Normal, and Not Recommended). Furthermore, the Japan NCAP has provided consumers with comparative information on vehicles’ braking capability on wet and dry pavements. In addition to those named above, Vashun Cole, Michelle Dresben, Colin Fallon, Kathleen Gilhooly, Doug Manor, Terry Richardson, Beverly Ross, Brian Sells, Jena Sinkfield, Stacey Thompson, and Frank Taliaferro made key contributions to this report.

Summary:
Electricity generation is vital to the commerce and daily functioning of the United States. The U.S. electric grid has historically operated with a high level of reliability. The various parts of the electric power system are all vulnerable to failure due to natural, operational, or manmade events. Adoption of digital technologies has improved the efficiency and speed of operations and processes, and allowed for the development of new systems for the grid to protect against cyberattacks and other threats to critical infrastructure. The grid also connects the many publicly and privately owned electric utility and other wholesale power companies in different states and regions. The electric grid relies on a number of electronic devices, switches, and circuit breakers to regulate and report on the flow of electricity. Often, these digital devices are also connected to the internet to increase the ability to share information with a multitude of users and devices. The grid's ICS networks essentially operate in a "control loop" in which sensors continually check key components, with variable responses against control variables to ensure that the system is functioning as designed. The benefits of internet-connected digital technologies are many, so too are the risks of a cybersecurity breach. In 2015, a cyber attack on distribution utility substations in Ukraine shut off power to over 225,000 utility customers for several hours. Cyber intrusions on the SCADA systems of the Bowman Dam in Rye, New York resulted in federal indictments against a group of hackers linked to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. In March 2018, the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team issued an alert concerning cyber intrusions at critical energy and manufacturing infrastructure companies. The Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation concluded that Russian government hackers conducted a multi-stage intrusion campaign to access files on ICS networks. Congress gave the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) authority to oversee the reliability of the bulk-power system under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. FERC can approve or remand back reliability standards proposed by the Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) The standards are both mandatory and enforceable in that violators of reliability rules may be subject to a civil fine of up to $1 million per violation for each day that it continues. While a cyber attack aimed at U.S. critical energy infrastructure has led to heightened attention from the federal government. Attack on the U.S. grid similar to the cyber attacks in Ukraine was not expected to result in the same type of consequences. President Trump issued Executive Order (E.O.) 13800 on "Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure" E.O. 13800 called for an assessment of a prolonged electric power outage resulting from a cyber attack. The cyber supply chain and public-private cybersecurity information sharing were listed among a number of major cybersecurity potential vulnerabilities. Department of Energy has established a new Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER) CESER is to focus on more coordinated preparedness and response to natural and man-made threats to energy infrastructure security. The energy sector is one of 16 infrastructure sectors designated as critical infrastructure by Presidential Policy Directive-21 (PPD-21) A report released by the National Research Council (NRC) in 2012 recognized the vulnerability of the electric power delivery system to either cyber and/or physical attacks. The NRC report concluded that well-informed terrorists could black out a large region of the country for weeks or even months. The largest power system disruptions experienced to date in the United States have caused high economic impacts. Cyber attacks are unlikely to cause extended outages, but if well coordinated they could magnify the damage of a physical attack, the report said. The event of this magnitude and duration could lead to turmoil, widespread public fear and an image of helplessness that would play directly into the hands of the terrorists. The 2013 attack on the Metcalf substation in California further cast light on the physical vulnerabilities of the grid. The scenario estimated the total impact to the U.S. economy at between $243 billion and $1 trillion. It took the local utility 27 days to restore the substation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's chairman at the time reportedly said that "if [the attack] were widely replicated across the country, it would have a significant impact" on the economy. It was averted by rerouting power around the substations. country, it could take down the U.S. electric grid and black out much of the country. Recovery from a well-planned cyber and physical attack on the grid could be complicated by the cost and vulnerability of critical components. A large-scale attack may use up the limited inventory of spare units, and it may take months or years to build new units. The availability of other large components, such as high-voltage circuit breakers, could also hamper recovery efforts. The security of the supply chain for grid devices and components is discussed later in this report. Every two years, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) organizes a two-day grid security exercise. The goals of GridEx include the determination of ways to best secure the grid and improve future response. The 2017 GridEx drill was the fourth iteration of the exercise, and had over 6,500 participants from the United States, Canada, and Mexico. NERC released its public report of the results of the GridEx IV drill, listing lessons learned and recommendations to enhance grid security. The Cyber Mutual Assistance (CMA) program is intended to provide a pool of utility cybersecurity experts who can share their expertise. NERC recommended that more utilities should participate in the CMA program. The bulk power system faces new and evolving cybersecurity threats on a daily basis, according to NERC. A focus on recovery from a potential large-scale physical or cyber attack appears to be an increasing part of the exercises, NERC said in a report. It recommended that the ESCC and the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center (E-ISAC) also increase their participation in the program. Cyber risks can come from direct attacks aimed at the electric grid or other critical infrastructure. Arguably, the greatest cyber threats to the grid have been attacks focused on manipulating industrial control systems. ICS-CERT issues an annual report on ICS network vulnerabilities based on reports of cyber intrusions. It found that 61% of these vulnerabilities would likely cause a "severe operational impact," if exploited in a cyber attack. The Mandiant consulting company reported that it responded to a cyber intrusion at a critical infrastructure organization where malware was deployed. The malware deployed to attack a transmission system control center in the 2016 cyber attack in Ukraine was named "Industroyer" or "Crash Override" The malware accesses the same protocols used by electric grid systems to communicate with each other. Cyber threats to the grid can also emerge from attacks directed via Internet of Things (IoT) devices connected to networks. If such attacks were able to access electric utility operational or industrial control systems, they could potentially impair these systems or cause false power networks. The electric utility industry increasingly depends on Operational Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT) systems for the safe and efficient production and delivery of electricity. OT and IT systems rely on hardware devices and software systems, procured from a variety of manufacturers and vendors, often from international sources. Cyber supply chain risks may include insertion of counterfeits, unauthorized production, tampering, theft, insertion of malicious software and hardware, as well as poor manufacturing and development practices in the cyber supply chain. The components of smart grid devices present another potential vulnerability. its functioning in a reliable manner. Older, legacy systems may also be affected by potential supply chain vulnerabilities. Legacy systems are a challenging vulnerability because upgrades and repairs of equipment may not include the installation of up-to-date, security-focused patches. In 2016, FERC issued Order No. 829 directing NERC to develop a Critical Infrastructure Protection reliability standard that would require affected entities to develop and implement a plan that includes security controls for supply chain management for industrial control system hardware, software, and services. There are gaps in cybersecurity for electric power and energy systems. Some gaps are related to regulatory jurisdiction, while other gaps may relate to cost and complexity. OT systems are often used by electric utilities to monitor and control power production processes. modernization of ICS networks has led to OT and IT systems becoming increasingly interconnected. But considering the potential impact of a major grid cybersecurity event, the gaps may require further attention. The gaps may need further attention, according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology.  OT systems are often directly connected to the Internet, in some cases so that third-party vendors can remotely connect to the system to perform diagnostics and maintenance. Many cybersecurity breaches are caused by individuals falling prey to phishing or similar attacks which are used to gain credentials to access utility systems. The human factor is thus considered by many to be the weakest link in cybersecurity. This was the reason why many OT networks are not protected by a firewall and are outdated. Economic challenges, resource constraints, business requirements and the pace of technological change are reported as making it nearly impractical to completely segregate OT networks from IT networks. case in Ukraine, as hackers sent out malware-carrying emails. After links in the emails were opened by legitimate users, hackers acquired the credentials needed to access control and operations systems. Covellite has been targeting electric utilities in the U.S., Europe, and parts of East Asia with spear-phishing attacks that employ code and infrastructure eerily similar to that used by the so-called Lazarus Group. Multi-factor authentication is one security method focused on the human factor, as it requires two or more credentials. FERC acknowledged that the Energy Policy Act of 2005 excluded local distribution systems from its reliability mandate under Section 215 of the Federal Power Act. FERC's revised 2012 definition brought some of these larger distribution system components under BES regulation. Most distribution systems are not required to comply with NERC CIP cybersecurity standards. Electricity production depends in large part upon other electricity production. A combination of something you know, something you have, or something you are (i.e., a biometric) establishes you as a legitimate user. critical infrastructure sectors for fuel, fuel delivery, and support systems. PPD-21 also establishes Energy and Communications systems as "uniquely critical" infrastructure. NERC itself concluded in its report on GridEx III that, after a major grid disruption, restarting generation and energizing transmission and distribution systems would be first priority. Restoring service to communications systems, oil and gas, water supply/treatment, and hospital customers would be a secondary priority. It is unlikely that an adversary capable of causing extreme impairment to the electric power system would overlook other, less protected critical infrastructure. Digital Smart grid technologies to enhance and modernize grid operations. Speed and processing power of microprocessor-based ICS networks enhances the efficiency and control of power production and flows across electricity transmission and distribution systems. Many in Congress recognize that grid and pipeline cybersecurity are intertwined. AI is one of the technologies being deployed to mitigate cybersecurity risks. It allows computer systems to simulate human learning and problem solving. The speed of processing of AI systems are currently seen as providing protection for ICS and other networks that human operators may not be able to match. AI can potentially respond to a cyber attack scenario far more quickly than a human decision maker. Electric utilities are collecting massive amounts of data from ICS networks and customer-information systems. Big data refers to the growth in the volume of structured and unstructured data. High performance computing can take advantage of fast processing to examine data sets collected from Smart Grid systems into operational information, according to the report. Using Data Analytic techniques, Big data can be turned into useful information, the report says. Artificial intelligence can be used for offensive as well as defensive cybersecurity applications. The next generation of situation-aware malware will use AI to behave like a human attacker. Just as organizations can use artificial intelligence to enhance their security posture, cybercriminals may begin to use it to build smarter malware. The application of AI to surveillance or cybersecurity for national security opens a new attack vector based on this data diet vulnerability, says Andrew Barocas, co-author of "Big Data's Disparate Impact" The Aurora simulation in 2007 was the first known event which proved that power plants could be vulnerable to a cyber attack. An AURORA attack results when a circuit breaker or breakers are opened and closed, resulting in an out-of-phase condition. Three years later, the Stuxnet attack against the industrial control system of an Iranian nuclear fuel enrichment plant provided the next step in the development of cyber weapons. But it is conceivable that future developments in swarm or distributed AI may result in strategic botnets with small malware payloads but devastating effects. NERC aims to increase monitoring of the bulk electric system, and has proposed a plan for the E-ISAC to be staffed 24 hours daily. FERC also seeks increased reporting of cyber incidents. NERC would file an annual, public and anonymized summary of the reports with the Commission. DOE, for its part, has established its own mandatory reporting requirements for U.S. electric utilities experiencing emergency incidents. Form OE-417 alerts the Department of Energy to electrical emergency incidents and disruptions. Electric power incidents and outages have various criteria for reporting depending on the level of urgency of the situation. An Emergency Alert must be filed within one hour of an incident. The information collected by Form OE-417 is to be used for reporting on electric power emergency incidents and disturbances in monthly Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports. The data may use the data to develop legislative recommendations and reports to Congress, and as a basis for DOE investigations following severe, prolonged, or repeated electric power reliability problems. Some utilities are undertaking security improvements in modernization programs. Other improvements would potentially have to be undertaken as special projects. Intelligence on the existence and nature of the threat, as well as the capability of dealing with the threat often relies on the federal government's national security apparatus. The information communicated from the government is generally more useful when it is both timely and relevant as to the severity of a threat, and when the threat is related to the source of the information. The U.S. Department of Energy says it has no immediate comment on the report. Communicate whether a need exists for immediate action. The electricity industry then provides the expertise necessary for understanding the relative risk to the grid of the potential threat. As of the end of 2015, 75% of U.S electricity customers were covered by companies which had deployed CRISP. There has been speculation that a major cyber attack may be inevitable, given the many diverse actors in the cyber threat space with both political and commercial interests. The Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council (ESCC) has called for the E-ISAC to be the "central source of information sharing between the Electricity Sub sector and the government" New technologies are being considered for their potential to enhance electric power transmission and distribution system resiliency. Sensors and automated controls can use real-time data to reconfigure a utility network to isolate problems. Smart Grid solutions would utilize fast acting sensors and tools to gather and analyze information. However, distributed data centers powered by energy supplies independent of the grid may be needed to ensure that recovery from a cyber attack is not hampered by the loss of information and data needed to recover operations and business systems. Distributed resources and microgrids are also being considered both in terms of making the current grid more resilient and as an increased element of the future grid. The state of New York has been working with investor-owned electric utilities on a plan to deploy distributed resources at scale as part of its plan to modernize its energy systems. Distributed generation is growing and could potentially be a source for black start power in the event of a grid failure. These smaller power plants would have to be protected against cybersecurity attacks if they were to operate independently of the grid. Large, high voltage electric power transformers (LPTs) have received special attention as a critical component of the bulk electric system which could be targeted in physical and cyber attacks. LPTs are not commonly manufactured in the United States. The investor-owned electric utilities have had a transformer sharing program in place since 2006 with those utilities that wanted to participate. In March 2017, DOE submitted a plan to Congress evaluating the feasibility of establishing a Strategic Transformer Reserve for the storage, in strategically located facilities, of spare large powertransformers and emergency mobile substations. submitted a report to Congress on the strategic reserve, highlighting the issues of time to build, cost, and potential federal ownership. DOE found that given FERC's approval of CIP-014 reliability standards, supporting enhanced industry programs for spare transformer sharing might be a better way to achieve a strategic reserve. DOE also stated that it is encouraging manufacturers to design transformers to meet high resilience standards for electromagnetic pulse (EMP) and geomagnetic disturbances (GMD), as well as physical and cybersecurity. The electric power industry does not have the intelligence gathering capabilities to deal with the many cyber and physical threats to the grid. The energy sector is one of 16 critical infrastructure sectors identified by the Department of Homeland Security. The Grid Cybersecurity Research and Development Act ( H.R. 4120 ), introduced in October 2017, would require the DOE to develop an initiative to mitigate the consequences on the electric grid of cyber attacks by the U.S. government. The electric power system in the United States is evolving, but not consistently across sectors and regions of the country. increasing grid cybersecurity. The Pipeline and Liquefied Natural Gas Facility Cybersecurity Preparedness Act would require the Secretary of Energy to ensure security, resiliency, and survivability of natural gas pipelines. The Enhancing Grid Security through Public-Private Partnerships Act would promote and advance physical and cybersecurity of electric utilities. The Promoting Cybersecurity for Rural Electric Utilities Act would amend the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to provide that cybersecurity and grid security improvements are eligible for electric loans and guarantees under that act.

Summary:
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (1996 Act) is virtually silent with respect to Internet Protocol (IP), broadband networks, and online voice, data, and video services. New technologies have driven changes in market structure throughout the communications sector that were not contemplated by the 1996 Act. The statutory framework imposes obligations and prohibitions on certain networks and service providers, but also provides privileges and rights. There is no consensus about the changes needed, but there is agreement that the statutory framework should foster innovation, investment, and competition. how to accommodate technological change that already has taken place and, more dynamically, how to make the framework flexible enough to accommodate future technological change. Given that scale economies allow for only a very small number of efficient facilities-based network competitors. How to give those few network providers the incentive to invest and innovate while also constraining their ability to impede downstream competition from independent service providers who must use their networks. And how to implement a framework that fosters efficient spectrum use and management. Congress will be addressing these three broad questions during a time of great market uncertainty. The communications sector does not look at all as it did when the Telecommunications Act was passed in 1996. Consumer behavior in 2013 bears little resemblance to that in 1996, says. Many incumbents enjoying record revenues and profits, and many new entrants enjoying rapid revenue gains though they may not yet have attained profitability. It is difficult to predict which business models ultimately will succeed, and therefore it is hard to predict the ultimate impact of proposed statutory changes, he says. The need for caution should not necessarily be justification for inaction, he adds. eMarketer: Average adult will spend over 5 hours per day online, on nonvoice mobile activities or with other digital media this year. Verizon Communications chief financial officer Francis Shammo reportedly has stated that its recent deal with the National Football League for the rights to live-stream football games on 7.5-inch devices or smaller was "pretty significant for us" James Dolan, chief executive officer of Cablevision Systems, a major cable company, has reportedly stated that "Ultimately over the long term I think that the whole video product is eventually going to go over the Internet" Digital technologies have led to the "convergence" of networks. This has fundamentally changed market structure. "True convergence" is not the offering of a "bundle" of several products into a single service offering. It is a technological spillover that reduces entry costs so that existing firms find it profitable to extend their network into related markets, a decision that would not be profitable without the spillover. The impact has had substantial impact on U.S. markets and on the efficacy of the existing communications statutory framework. those firms with assets in a related market that have been affected by the spillover can afford to enter. Network providers that are able to exploit these technological spillovers can enter new service markets. Second, independent efforts by a wide variety of large and small entrepreneurs, using unlicensed as well as licensed spectrum, have yielded a mobile wireless alternative to local wireline broadband networks that is viable for most popular consumer and small business applications. But providers whose service-specific networks could not be readily modified to exploit spillovers, such as satellite operators unable to offer quality high speed Internet access or voice services, have failed to gain new business opportunities. This new mobile wireless ecosystem includes (1) cellular broadband wireless networks (sometimes referred to as macro networks) (2) femtocell and other small cell networks that extend the reach of macro networks. (3) WiFi networks that sometimes compete with macro networks but more often provide essential offloading and backhaul capabilities. Most digital services are applications that ride on existing wireline or wireless broadband networks; although they directly or indirectly compensate broadband network providers for use of their networks, digital service providers do not. not face the substantial fixed upfront costs associated with constructing a network. Technology-driven reduction in content distribution costs has fostered entry into the distribution of all types of content. This has created incentives for distributors to merge with content providers, for example, for Comcast to acquire NBC Universal. Dish Network, which cannot offer broadband services over its satellite network, in recent months has made (unsuccessful) offers to buy the wireless broadband providers Clearwire, Sprint, and LightSquared. The American Cable Association, Time Warner Cable, and DirecTV have filed with the FCC a petition to deny the transfer of five stations from Belo to Gannett. Broadcaster consolidation may be triggering countervailing consolidation in the video distribution market. Liberty Media, which owns 27% of Charter Communications, seeks to have Charter purchase Time Warner Cable and then additional cable systems. SNLFinancial reports that "Time Warner Cable, which reportedly showed little interest in a deal with Charter, is reportedly eyeing mergers with Cablevision Systems Corp., which Charter also is eyeing, and Cox Communications Inc." Charter CEO Thomas Rutledge predicted that only "two major players" will eventually emerge in the U.S. cable industry. Charlie Ergen of Dish Network has suggested that a merger of Dish and DirecTV, which was rejected by the antitrust authorities in the past, might be possible now. If ownership consolidation by broadcasters triggers countervailing consolidation by video distributors, many programmer-distributor negotiations will feature large companies on both sides of the table. This may make it more difficult for either party to impose its will on the other. But a battle between two companies, each with sufficiently deep pockets to be willing and able to withstand an extended blackout may injure consumers.  operator is across the table from an independent broadcast television station, with the smaller entity at a negotiating disadvantage. If the broadcast television stations in a local market are part of a large television group, and especially if that group owns more than one station in that market, local retailers and other local advertisers may find themselves at a disadvantage when attempting to negotiate local advertising rates. The new market opportunities and new market forces generated by technological change have, overall, been a boon to stakeholders in the communications sector, with incumbents as well as new entrants benefiting. There has been nearly $250 billion in private capital investment in U.S. wired and wireless broadband networks since 2009. SNLFinancial forecasts a long-term decline in cable companies' capital expenditures, from a peak of $13.1 billion in 2012 to $11.4 billion in 2016. The decline may, in part, be the result of consolidation as mergers and joint marketing agreements reduce the number of competitors that must build out national networks. But there are some indications that network capital expenditures will fall. SNLFinancial has begun to construct a database on five types of OTT deployments. OTT aggregators include Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Apple's iTunes, Redbox, Automated Retail LLC, Verizon's Redbox Instant, Time Warner's Warner Archive, Sony Entertainment Network. As the OTT segment matures, more data may be collected to help policy makers analyze the impact of alternative public policies on the health and viability of applications markets, says SNLFinancial's John Defterios. There is no consensus on the extent to which households that had been subscribers to a pay cable, satellite, or telephone multi-channel video have "cut the cord" But such cord-cutting is an identifiable trend. A recent study by GfK reportedly found that 19.3% of television homes (22.4 million) have broadcast-only reception (though they may also get programming online), compared with 17.8% in 2012. The current statutory framework was shaped by negotiations among the many stakeholders present at the time the statutes were being developed. Existing statutory provisions may no longer be effectively fostering competition, public safety. In a technologically dynamic sector, the statutory framework cannot be modified every time there is a significant technological change. Existing statutes are silent on digital technology, Internet protocol, broadband networks, and online services, forcing the FCC, FCC and Copyright Office to implement the provisions. The challenge is to create statutory language that is flexible enough to continue to foster articulated public policy objectives in the face of technological change, without artificially favoring either legacy technology or new technology. Copyright Office, and courts to extrapolate to these new technologies provisions explicitly crafted for legacy technologies. Online video distributors do not meet the statutory definitions of a "multichannel video programming distributor (MVPD)," "cable company," or "satellite carrier," and thus are treated differently than their distribution competitors. These differences in rights and obligations are likely to distort, and may undermine, potential competition from over-the-top online video distributors, CRS says. CRS has explored in detail the policy issues that this has created in the video distribution market. Broadcast Music Inc. (BMI), which represents 600,000 songwriters, composers, and music publishers, filed an action asking a federal court to set royalty rates for Internet radio service Pandora. Similar analysis can be performed of other technology-specific definitions and provisions in current statute to determine whether they favor some competing services over others. For example, the statutory treatment of copyright for the public performance rights for sound recordings is different for terrestrial broadcast radio (that is, AM and FM radio stations) than for satellite radio. Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) has filed with the FCC a petition to deny the license transfer. A cable or satellite operator must obtain a copyright license to retransmit the copyrighted material on broadcast signals to its subscribers. But a consuming household does not have to pay a license fee to capture the same broadcast programming. For example, the public performance of copyrighted works on broadcast television signals is subject to copyright licensing, but the private performance of such works is not. A company that is constrained by regulatory restrictions or prohibitions, or by patent or copyright restrictions, can "invent around" the impediment. directly over the air with use of a rooftop antenna. Video distributors therefore have the incentive to develop and deploy technologies that mimic the household's rooftop antenna or in some other fashion allow the consuming household to directly capture the broadcast signal. A start-up company, Aereo, now has deployed thousands of mini-antennas, which, though maintained at Aereo's own premises, are assigned to individual subscribers as their personal antennas. Aereo claims that it is not a video distributor but rather a technology rental company and that the programs received by its subscribers are private performances. Aereo has been able to continue to offer its service to residents of New York, Connecticut, and Vermont. AereoKiller/FilmOnX cases are expected to threaten Aereo's expansion plans. If the broadcasters are unsuccessful on this issue and lose copyright revenues, they are likely to pursue alternate compensation, most likely by seeking to make Aereo and similarly situated video distributors subject to retransmission consent requirements. Currently, online video distributors such as Aereo do not meet the definition of an MVPD. broadcasters would have to seek a statutory change. Congress may choose to address this issue through legislation. In another copyright case involving new technology, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has affirmed the denial of a preliminary injunction against a Dish Network product, Auto-Hop. The court found that the plaintiffs "did not establish a likelihood of success on its claim of secondary infringement," the appeals court said in its ruling. The current legal uncertainty is making it more difficult for both programmers and distributors to make business decisions, the court said. on its affirmative defense that the customers' copying was a 'fair use' The case will proceed, but whatever its outcome Congress may want to review copyright law in light of new technologies being developed by video distributors. In the digital age, it is very cheap and easy to copy and distribute works, so copyright laws must set up a framework for protecting the intellectual property rights of the copyright holders. Digital technology provides unique opportunities for unleashing the value in existing works that may be denied if the creator of the work is allowed to curtail innovative uses. The Department of Commerce Internet Policy Task Force has released a report, Copyright Policy, Creativity, and Innovation in the Digital Economy. The report tends to focus more on protecting copyright holders' intellectual property than on removing disincentives for third party use of copyrighted materials. Some of the issues identified in the report, which Congress may want to investigate, include the following: A proposal supported by the Administration to extend the public performance right for sound recordings to cover broadcasting. Assessing the appropriateness of different rate-setting standards for thepublic performance of sound recordings by different types of digital music services. public performance right—such as streaming copyrighted materials without a license—a felony, rather than a misdemeanor. Reviewing the relevance and scope of the "first-sale doctrine" in the digital environment. A proposal supported by the Administration to ensure that consumers have the ability to unlock their cell phones, subject to applicable service agreements. A review of the legal framework for the creation of remixes, which some observers claim is being unacceptably impeded by legal uncertainty. The administration is also considering a proposal to allow music fans to download songs without paying for them. is embodied (a book or a CD) is exhausted; the owner of that material object can thereafter dispose of the object as she sees fit. But unlike a tangible transfer, a digital transfer between two end users results in a reproduction of the work. The reproduction right is not subject to the first-sale doctrine limitation, so such transfers are a copyright infringement. Reviewing the application of statutory damages in the context of individual file-sharers and secondary liability for large-scale online infringement. the private sector improve the online licensing environment. Derek Khanna raises several additional copyright issues that may affect innovation. The original copyright term was 14 years, plus a 14 year renewal if the author were still alive. Over time it has been extended and now the term is the lifetime of the author plus 70 years. Khanna suggests that these time periods may be inconsistent with the constitutional language restricting exclusive rights to "limited times" He claims that these lengthy terms benefit content producers, but harm other, added-value services. Khanna proposes more stringent requirements for requests that content be removed from websites. He also argues for an expansion of what is legally fair use. Khanna also proposes penalties for fake takedown requests, which have a chilling effect on legitimate speech. The current federal statutory framework for communications contains many provisions intended to foster specific public policy objectives, Khanna says. But most of those provisions only apply to a subset of communications networks that are "telecommunications carriers," that is providers of telecommunications services, he says. IP networks offer voice services in direct competition with the voice services provided by telecommunications carriers. The latter may be subject to regulations that do not apply to the former. Among telecommunications carriers, there is a statutory hierarchy, with some carriers subject to greater regulation than others. Many state regulatory agencies require ILECs (and sometimes all LECs) to be "carriers of the voice of the people they are supposed to serve" and "carrier of the data they are meant to transmit" last resort" and to serve all requesting customers in their service areas upon demand. In the on-going broadband transition, many network providers are migrating from legacy circuit-switched, largely copper networks that use time division multiplexing technology. AT&T has announced its intention to upgrade all of its wireline and wireless facilities to IP, which may result in it no longer serving about one percent of its customers. But in some cases the network providers, which have invested billions of dollars to deploy these new networks, are required by federal or state law to maintain their legacy networks. legacy customers. It has asked the FCC to open a proceeding to address transition issues. The FCC has opened a proceeding and also has created an internal Technology Transitions Policy Task Force. But the FCC will deliberate in the absence of congressional guidance about which of the statutory requirements on legacy networks should apply to new networks. Some issues of potential interest to Congress include the following: VoIP Interconnection: IP networks rely on negotiated "peering agreements" for the exchange of traffic. But there have been instances of " peering disputes" in which networks refuse to exchange traffic. FCC plans to have trials to determine how VoIP and other IP-based networks can interconnect with emergency service IP networks (ESInets) Congress may want to review statutory requirements to make sure they are not impeding the E911 to NG911 transition. Some ILECs are replacing existing customer voice and broadband services delivered over legacy circuit switched wireline networks with similar product offerings delivered over fiber and/or wireless IP networks. There are a number of federal and state statutory requirements, first enacted during the long period of government-sanctioned monopoly provision of telephone service. FCC certifies that the public interest will not be adversely affected in the present or future. Many states impose "carrier of last resort" service obligations that require ILECs to serve customers in their service areas on demand. Congress may want to provide the FCC with guidance on how to weigh the tradeoff between rapid IP deployment and protection of end users who may not wish to adopt new technologies. The transition to an IP world is inevitable, but late adopters will prefer to control the timing of their change-over. In 1996, Congress passed the Telecommunications Act (1996 Act), which sought to open up markets to competition by removing unnecessary regulatory barriers to entry. The 1996 Act attempted to foster competition among providers that used similar underlying network technologies to offer a single type of service. Technological advances not envisioned by, or addressed in, the 1996 Act, however, created spillovers that began to allow for inter modal competition. Increasingly, both the legacy telephone companies and the legacy cable networks are migrating their traffic onto IP networks. AT&T has had challenges meeting long-standing regulatory requirements. Wireless networks do not have the same bandwidth capability as optical fiber networks and upgraded coaxial cable networks. But they do offer sufficient bandwidth for many applications, and especially for many consumer and small business users. They also provide complementary mobile services for enterprise customers and other heavy-bandwidth users. It has been able to deploy its FiOS service, but neither has been unable to provide high bandwidth landline broadband service universally throughout its service area. In September 2012 Verizon announced that it would not expand its FiOS fiber-optic network beyond its existing contractual obligations. Yet Tony Melone, Verizon's chief technical officer, explicitly included the FiOS network among the four platforms the company plans to use in the future. The high cost of FiOS deployment appears to be constraining the footprint on which such deployment will take place. The decision of the cable companies to forgo entry into the wireless market, and Verizon's acquisition of an important block of wireless broadband spectrum, may reduce the amount of investment. The Verizon/cable company transactions highlight the possibility that the enter/don't enter/exit decisions of incumbent network providers can markedly change market forces and incentives. Congress may want to consider whether structural constraints (such as spectrum caps) and/or behavioral constraints are needed to limit the market power of vertically integrated network providers. Given the spectrum available to independent wireless carriers and limit Verizon's participation in the video market to those geographic markets in which it already offers FiOS service, this could be a problem. Congress may want to be sure that its statutory framework is able to address competition and other public policy issues. There are four general approaches that a statutory framework could take. Ex ante rules and ex post adjudication both typically focus on anti-competitive discrimination that harms consumers, but in distinct ways. The dominant cost characteristic of the communications sector is the substantial fixed costs, and associated scale and scope economies, of large networks. Both wireline and wireless broadband markets are highly competitive, with many players. broadband networks are subject to economies of scale that limit the number of efficient competitors that can participate in the market. Historically the statutory framework for communications has focused on market structure. Given recent enter/don't enter/exit decisions by major network providers, there has been increased interest in structural regulation. Some observers have alleged that the two dominant carriers may have the incentive to strategically hoard spectrum, depriving smaller carriers of access to the low frequency spectrum that has superior propagation characteristics. The basic principle behind a network non-discrimination regime is to give users the right to use non-harmful attachments or applications. In December 2010, the FCC adopted its Open Internet Order, establishing ex ante rules to govern the network management practices of broadband Internet access providers. Proponents claim that such a regime avoids some of the costs of structural regulation by allowing for efficient vertical integration so long as the rights granted to the users of the network are not compromised. There are three primary components: transparency, no blocking, and no disclosure of performance terms to consumers and to content, application, service, and device providers. It therefore applies both to end users and to independent applications providers. Network management. Mobile providers are prohibited from blocking consumers from accessing lawful websites, subject to reasonable network management. No unreasonable discrimination: fixed (but not mobile) broadband Internet service providers may not unreasonably discriminate in transmitting lawful network traffic over a consumer's broadband Internet access service. Reasonable network management shall not constitute unreasonable discrimination. Multiple appeals of the order, challenging the FCC's authority to impose these rules, have been filed and subsequently consolidated for review in the U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit. Proponents of non-discrimination rules argue that the restrictions harm consumers and applications providers. Critics of e x ante non- discrimination rules claim that such rules would intrude too much into the business plans of broadband network providers. An alternative approach would adjudicate alleged abuses of market power ex post on a case-by-case basis, they say. The Progress and Freedom Foundation has proposed an ex post approach modeled after the Federal Trade Commission Act which would give the FCC authority to adjudicate allegations of "unfair methods of competition" Representative Sensenbrenner, stated concern that the decision not be "perceived as giving a green light to all manner of anticompetitive behavior by the Bells" Then-ranking minority member of the House Judiciary Committee Conyers called for legislation to address the "Supreme Court's horrible blunder" Representatives Sensen brenner and Conyers introduced a bill in May 2004 that would have added a section to the Clayton Act to make unlawful actions such as those that had been taken by Verizon. The bill did not move forward. utility commissions], rather than judges all across the country." It may be that, when Congress inserted the "antitrust savings" clause in the 1996 Act, many Members believed that the clause was preserving an unlimited private right of action on the part of other-than-directly affected parties to sue. But, as this case indicates, the clause may be of little effect in instances such as this in which it is found that traditional antitrust principles and standards are not implicated. Under current FCC and court interpretations of law, IP network providers and providers of information services are not subject to the provisions in Title II of the Communications Act. The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (1992 Cable Act, P.L. 102-385 ) established rules that govern the carriage (retransmission) of television signals by cable operators. Congress was concerned that cable companies might refuse to carry the signals of local broadcast stations. The regulatory framework also includes broadcast media ownership rules (some explicitly in statute, some implemented by the FCC but later referred to in statute) There are separate rules addressing the number of television stations that a single entity may own or control in a local market. In 1992, there were only limited multichannel pay television alternatives to cable. Today, Dish Network operates in all 210 U.S. markets, DirecTV in about 195 markets. As a result, the cable companies have lost some of their leverage when negotiating retransmission consent agreements with broadcasters, authors say. The terms, conditions, and rates that had to be negotiated within retransmissions consent agreements increased exponentially, they say. They say this created many more elements that potentially could create a new business model. In recent years, many television stations have entered into sharing arrangements with other stations in their local market. Such agreements have resulted in so-called "virtual duopolies" that would not be allowed under the local ownership rule if the first station had control. In part to create a negotiating impasse, the FCC has not deemed a station to have control over another station in the same market even if such control is considered to exist, and must be reported, under generally accepted accounting practices. In some cases, these larger station groups also will enjoy duopoly or virtual duopoly positions in some local markets. 86% of households nationwide subscribe to a multichannel video service, down from 88% in 2010. Of the television households that do not subscribe to an MVPD service, 42% get one or more of the three major over-the-top services (Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu Plus) About 1.4% of all television households discontinued subscription to a MVPD over the past year, suggesting no great surge in "cord cutting" households. Online video distributors do not qualify as MVPDs and therefore are not subject to the retransmission consent requirements. negotiations more contentious, with greater risk of impasses. SNLFinancial has identified 35 retransmission consent blackouts between 2005 and 2013 that lasted 28 days or longer. Congress is more likely to be concerned about broadcast-related blackouts because of its long-standing commitment to localism and diversity of voices, authors say. They say Congress may want to review the current statutory framework to determine whether any changes are needed to make it more effective in the new market environment characterized by greater consolidation. By statute, an entity may own and operate local broadcast stations that reach, in total, up to 39% of U.S. television households. But when calculating the total audience reach by an entity's stations, the so-called "UHF discount" is applied. This discount had been imposed because in the pre-digital analog world UHF stations had less reach than VHF stations. The FCC has issued for public comment a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that tentatively concludes the UHF discount should be eliminated. Small cable operators say they are at a distinct disadvantage in retransmission consent negotiations. They cite a study by Professor William P. Rogerson that claims that smaller MVPDs pay twice as high per subscriber. The Television Consumer Freedom Act would indirectly address some of the complexities that are affecting broadcaster/MVPD negotiations, says John Avlon. Avlon: There are market forces at play that could constrain the recent increase in programmer-distributor impasses and blackouts without any government intervention. actual and threatened blackouts therefore may increase the rate of "cord-cutting"—of households abandoning MVPDs altogether. Any significant migration of MVPD customers to over-the-top alternatives is likely to harm the financial position of broadcasters. Spectrum, by itself, is not of any use. It has value when technology is applied to it to create services. But the direction that the applied technology takes determines its value. As never before, there will be costs to society if the statutory framework does not foster efficient spectrum use. Will depend on the way spectrum is allocated for use and rules about such use. Technology development will take a very different path if spectrum users are assigned exclusive licenses to specific spectrum. There are already a number of spectrum sharing solutions in the market, says Peter Ravy. But what must be understood is that the spectrum-sharing approaches must be simple to use in extremely complex circumstances, Ravy says. The FCC has moved toward a hybrid approach to spectrum allocation in the "white spaces" that exist between licensed television broadcasters. blocks to specific licensees based on public interest criteria. Once allocated and assigned, spectrum could not readily be reallocated to a different use. As a result, much spectrum has been underutilized or available only for a relatively low-value use. Setting a price on spectrum and allowing its transfer to higher valued uses increases incentives for licensees to use their spectrum efficiently, authors say. They say public safety organizations and first responders need a reliable communications network, but may not have the funds to compete with commercial interests in spectrum auctions.  Spectrum is essential for the development of new network and application technologies and services. Some of that research is performed by established firms using their own available licensed spectrum. But some is done by start-up firms working on the technology frontier that do not have spectrum licenses. Even established firms may not have licenses for spectrum with the characteristics needed to perform their research. To foster innovation, it may be beneficial to set aside some spectrum for experimental, unlicensed, shared use constrained only by specified non-interference criteria. Major wireless carriers to transition from 2G to 3G and then 4G networks. Making sufficient spectrum available for experimentation and unlicensed services. Wi-Fi was able to develop in the unlicensed spectrum block set aside for spread spectrum. There is a long history of concern that competition could be constrained if a few wireless providers control so much of the bands that other providers are effectively foreclosed from the market, they say. The FCC first introduced a spectrum cap on mobile spectrum holdings in 1994 to promote diversity and competition. a transmitter in a particular spectrum frequency band is prohibited from allowing its signal to stray into an adjacent band. If the licensee is allowing this to happen, it would be ordered to discontinue transmission. In contrast, if the licensee's signal is not straying into an. adjacent band, but receivers in that adjacent band are not sufficiently well-tuned to pick up. only the signals from their own frequency band, there is no rule that would require the licensee to discontinues its transmission. Inexpensive GPS devices may well lack filters that keep them from picking up signals from adjacent channels. In 2011, testing of LightSquared's plan to offer terrestrial broadband service using a satellite band that is located next to the band used for GPS devices indicated some GPS receivers were subject to interference. Because of this impact on GPS owners, the FCC ultimately did not approve LightSquaring's proposal and that spectrum band has remained largely unused. More generally, the lack of rules that set requirements for receivers to be selective in the signals they pick up leads to valuable portions of the electromagnetic spectrum being kept out of service or only sparsely utilized. In absence of receiver ground rules, "moral hazard" may encourage risky behavior, authors say. Rules that "grandfather" inefficient legacy spectrum use may impose costs on future spectrum users, they say. Technological innovation and efficiency are important public policy objectives, but there are other policy goals that may not always be consistent with innovation, they write. Congress may want to provide guidance to the FCC on how best to weigh the tradeoffs between maximizing auction revenues and meeting these other public policy objective. A frequent way to avoid such harm is to "grandfather" the old regulation for those legacy providers or customers. If the proposed change would further a policy goal, then to the extent providers or consumers are excluded from the change, the public benefits will be reduced. These grandfather clauses, some explicit, some implied, are common in communications statutes and regulations or in how agencies choose to construct new rules. Many of the media ownership rules, such as the newspaper-broadcast cross ownership rule, grandfathered pre-existing cross ownership combinations. is possible that in some situations the overall public interest calculus will not allow for such grandfathering. It is also possible that it is not in the public interest to grandfather in the elderly or the disabled. It's possible that the grandfathering of the elderly would be in the best interests of the public. It could also be detrimental to the elderly to grandfather the elderly in the first place, as it could lead to an increase in the cost of health care for the elderly, for example. It would be possible to grandfather elderly people in the future, but it would be difficult to grandfather them now.

Summary:
Biofuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, are an alternative to petroleum-based transportation fuels. Ethanol is mainly used as a gasoline additive in blends of about 10 percent ethanol and 90 percent gasoline. Biodiesel is a renewable alternative fuel produced from a range of plant oils, animal fats, and recycled cooking oils. Production of ethanol from corn starch reached 9 billion gallons in 2008, according to the U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005. The federal government has promoted biofuels since the 1970s. There are a number of steps in the biofuels life cycle, from cultivation of the feedstock through distribution to the end user at the fuel pump. Water plays a critical role in many aspects of this life cycle. Unlike corn starch, most of the energy in plant and tree biomass is locked away in complex cellulose and hemicellulose molecules. Some cellulosic biorefineries are piloting the use of biochemical processes, in which microbes and enzymes break down these complex plant molecules to produce ethanol. The extent to which increased biofuel production will affect the nation’s water resources will depend on which feedstocks are selected for production and which areas of the country they are produced in. Increases in corn cultivation in areas that are highly dependent on irrigated water could have greater impacts on water availability. In contrast, many experts expect next generation feedstocks to require less water and provide some water quality benefits, but even with these feedstocks the effects on water resources are largely dependent on where and how these feedstock is grown. Fertilizer runoff containing nitrogen and phosphorus can lead to overenrichment and excessive growth of algae in surface waters. In some waters, such enrichment has resulted in harmful algal blooms, decreased water clarity, and reduced oxygen in the water. In marine waters, this excessive algal growth has created “dead zones,” which cannot support fish or any other organism that needs oxygen to survive. The number of reported dead zones around the world has increased since the 1960s to more than 400. A 2007 USGS model estimated that 52 percent of nitrogen and 25 percent of the phosphorus entering the Gulf system are from corn and soybean cultivation in the Mississippi River basin. Increased corn production will also increase the use of pesticides, which also have the potential to affect surface water and groundwater quality. Once groundwater is contaminated, it is difficult to clean up, according to the experts we contacted. According to some of the experts and officials we spoke with, increased demand for biofuel feedstocks may also create incentives for farmers to place marginal lands back into production. Millions of acres of land currently enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) CRP provides annual rental payments and cost share assistance to landowners who contractually agree to retire environmentally-sensitive cropland from agricultural purposes. As part of the contract, farmers are generally required to plant or maintain vegetative covers (such as native grasses) on the land. These covers provide a range of environmental benefits, including improved water quality, reduced erosion, enhanced wildlife habitat, and preserved soil productivity. Officials are concerned that higher corn prices and increased demand for biofuel feedstocks may encourage farmers to return CRP land to crop production. If such conversion does occur, these officials noted that water quality may further decline in the future. Next generation feedstocks for biofuels have the potential for fewer negative effects on water resources, but the magnitude of these effects remains largely unknown because these feedstocks have not yet been grown on a commercial scale. Experts suggested that certain water resource impacts were likely for the following potential feedstocks: Agricultural residues, such as corn stover, can provide feedstock for cellulosic ethanol production. Perennial grasses may require additional water or nutrient inputs. Perennial grasses such as mixed prairie and switchgrass can grow with less water than corn. Some experts cautioned that any water supply benefits from these grasses will only occur if they are rainfed. Woody biomass, such as biomass from the thinning of forests and cultivation of certain fast-growing tree varieties, could serve as feedstock for cellulosic ethanol production, according to some experts. Use of thinnings is not expected to impact water supply, as they are residuals from forest management. Algae cultivation is expected to consume a great deal of water. Some communities have become concerned about the potential impacts of withdrawals for biofuel production on their drinking water and municipal supplies. Algae are also being explored as a possible feedstock for advanced biofuels. Current estimates of the water needed to convert cellulosic feedstocks to ethanol range from 1.9 to 6.0 gallons of water per gallon of ethanol, depending on the technology used. In contrast, biodiesel conversion requires less water than ethanol conversion. variety of plant and animal-based feedstocks, providing more options when choosing a location. This flexibility in type of feedstock that can be converted allows such facilities to be built in locations with plentiful water supplies, lessening their potential impact. In addition to the water supply effects, biorefineries can have water quality effects because of the contaminants they discharge. The type of contaminant discharged varies by the type of biofuel produced. In contrast, biodiesel refineries discharge other pollutants such as other pollutants. Glycerin from small biodiesel refineries can be a problem if it is released into municipal wastewater facilities. It may disrupt the microbial processes used in wastewater treatment. Glycerin is less of a concern with larger biodieselRefineries because it is often extracted from the waste stream prior to discharge and refined for use in other products. Several state officials we spoke with told us these discharges are generally well-regulated under the Clean Water Act, which requires a permit to discharge pollutants. regulated waters under specific limits and conditions. Ethanol is highly corrosive and there is potential for releases into the environment that could contaminate groundwater and surface water, among other issues. When ethanol-blended fuels leak from underground storage tanks (UST) and aboveground tank systems, the contamination may pose greater risks than petroleum. The ethanol in these blended fuels causes benzene, a soluble and carcinogenic chemical in gasoline, to travel longer distances and persist in soil and groundwater than it would in the absence of ethanol. As biofuel production increases, farmers and the biofuel industry will need to consider regional differences in water supply and quality. Certain states may be better suited to cultivate particular feedstocks because of the amount and type of water available. Certain cellulosic feedstocks, such as switchgrass, would be well-suited for areas with limited rainfall. In Georgia, some experts said pine was likely to be cultivated as a next generation biofuel feedstock because the state has relatively limited land available for cultivation. have on the quality of individual water bodies and regional watersheds. Farmers need to consider local water quality effects when making decisions regarding the suitability of a particular feedstock. In addition, state officials should consider these effects when deciding where programs such as the CRP may be the most effective. For example, experts and officials told us it will be important to identify watersheds in the Midwest that are delivering the largest nutrient loads into the Mississippi River basin and, consequently, contributing to the Gulf of Mexico dead zone. Currently, many biorefineries are located in areas with limited water resources. Experts noted that states with enough rainfall to replenish underlying aquifers may be more appropriate locations. Water laws in certain states may influence the location of future bioreFineries. Agricultural conservation practices can reduce the effects of increased biofuel feedstock cultivation on water supplies in many parts of the U.S. and reduce the need for biofuel conversion facilities in the future. In Nebraska, where water supplies are already fully allocated, natural resource districts can require bio fuel conversion facilities to offset the water they will consume by reducing water use. Many experts and officials highlighted the importance of using agricultural conservation practices to reduce the potential effects of increased biofuel feedstock cultivation on water resources. These practices can reduce nutrient and pesticide runoff as well as soil erosion by retaining additional moisture and nutrients in the soil and disturbing the land less. Experts also identified conservation tillage practices as an important way to reduce soil erosion. The process of converting feedstocks to biofuels, technological innovations, and the use of alternative water sources can help reduce water supply and water quality impacts, but these options can be cost prohibitive. information to tailor water, fertilizer, and pesticide application to specific plots within a field. Other precision agriculture tools, like low-energy precision-application irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation systems, operate at lower pressures and have higher irrigation water application and distribution efficiencies. Genetic engineering has the potential to decrease the water, nutrient and pesticide requirements of biofuel feedstocks. Several experts and officials said that in order to promote such practices, it is important to continue funding and enrollment in federal programs, such as USDA’s Environmental Quality Incentives Program. Technological improvements have already increased water use efficiency in the ethanol conversion process. Water loss from cooling towers for biorefineries is responsible for approximately 50 to 70 percent of water consumption in modern dry-milling ethanol plants. Some ethanol plants are beginning to replace freshwater with alternative sources of water, such as effluent from sewage treatment plants or excess water from adjacent rock quarries. Many experts and officials stated that technological innovations for next generation biofuel conversion also have the potential to reduce the water supply and water quality impacts of increased biofuel production. of the experts and officials we spoke with identified areas where additional research is needed to evaluate and understand the effects of increased biofuel production on water resources. These needs fall into two broad areas: (1) research on the water effects of feedstock cultivation and conversion and (2) better data on local and regional waterresources. Experts and officials identified the following research needs: Genetically engineered biofuel feedstocks. Effects of cellulosic crops on hydrology. More research into the development of drought-tolerant and water- and nutrient-efficient crops. Research is needed on how to more efficiently cultivate algae to minimize the freshwater consumption and water quality impacts. Data on land use is needed to better understand how farmers decide whether to adopt agricultural conservation practices. Research is also needed to determine optimal placement of feedstocks and use of agricultural conservation Practices to get the best yields and minimize adverse environmental impacts, experts and officials told us. For example, 50 percent of agricultural land is rented, and renters may be making cultivation decisions that maximize short-term gains rather than focusing on the long-term health of the land. Existing and emerging technology innovations may be able to address some effects of conversion on water resources. Congress is considering legislation that would require DOE’s research, development, and demonstration programs to seek to advance energy and energy efficiency technologies. It would also require the Secretary of Energy to create a council to promote and enable, in part, improved energy and water use. The bill would require efforts to minimize freshwater use, increase water use efficiency, and utilize nontraditional water sources with efforts to improve the quality of that water. More research is needed to ensure that the next generation of biorefineries is as water efficient as possible. EPA officials noted that additional research related to storage and distribution of biofuels is also needed. More is needed into the compatibility of fuel blends containing more than 10 percent ethanol with the existing fueling infrastructure, they say. Better information is necessary to better define the spatial distribution, depth, quantity, physical and chemical characteristics for these lower-quality water sources, the authors say. It is unclear how much water has been or will be consumed with increases in cultivation and conversion of biofuel feedstocks. increased production may lead to significant water shortages in certain regions. Additional withdrawals in states relying heavily on irrigation for agriculture may place new demands on already stressed aquifers in the Midwest. Even in water-rich states, such as Iowa, concerns have arisen over the effects of increased biofuel production. We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional committees; the Secretaries of Agriculture, Energy, and the Interior; the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency; and other interested parties. The report will be available at no charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov. We conducted a systematic analysis of relevant articles of relevant scientific articles. We interviewed recognized experts affiliated with U.S.-based institutions, including academic institutions, the federal government, and research- oriented entities. We examined key assumptions, methods, and relevant findings of major scientific articles, primarily on water supply and water quality. We believe we have included the key scientific studies and have qualified our findings where appropriate. But it is important to note that, given our methodology, we may not have identified all of the studies with findings relevant to our objectives. the interview content analysis, we reviewed interviews, selected relevant statements from the interviews, and identified and labeled trends using a coding system. The methodology for each objective varied slightly, because the first objective focused on regional differences and therefore relied on case study interviews. Once relevant data were extracted and coded, we used the coded data to identify and analyze trends. We used the following categories to quantify responses of experts and officials: “some” refers to responses from 2 to 3 individuals, “several’ refers to. responses from 4 to 6 individuals, and “many” means responses from 7 or more individuals. our work from January 2009 to November 2009 in accordance with all sections of GAO’s Quality Assurance Framework that are relevant to our objectives. The framework requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to meet our stated objectives and to discuss any limitations in our work. We believe that the information and data obtained, and the analysis conducted, provide a reasonable basis for any findings and conclusions in this product. Reduces soil erosion caused by tillage and exposure of bare soil to wind and water. A close-growing crop that temporarily protects the soil during the interim period before the next crop is established.

Summary:
The public faces a high risk that critical services provided by the government and the private sector could be severely disrupted by the Year 2000 computing crisis. Financial transactions could be delayed, flights grounded, power lost, and national defense affected. America’s infrastructures are a complex array of public and private enterprises with many interdependencies at all levels. A single failure could cause a single failure to have adverse repercussions, the authors say. The information and telecommunications sector is especially important, they say. Year 2000 readiness problems in the international arena. Only 18 of 127 countries (14 percent) had a national Year 2000 program. Aircraft and other military equipment could be grounded because the computer systems used to schedule maintenance and track supplies may not work. Further, the Department of Defense (DOD) could incur shortages of military equipment if the problem is not corrected. The following are examples of some of the major disruptions the public and private sectors could experience if the Year 2000 problem isNot corrected. Unless the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) takes much more decisive action. Medical devices and scientific laboratory equipment may experience problems beginning January 1, 2000, if the computer systems, software applications, or embedded chips used in these devices contain two-digit fields for year representation. According to the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, failure to address the Year 2000 issue would cause banking institutions to experience operational problems or even bankruptcy. On February 4, 1998, the President signed an executive order that established the President’s Council on Year 2000 Conversion led by an Assistant to the President and composed of one representative from each of the executive departments. Many of the federal government’s computer systems were originally designed and developed 20 to 25 years ago. Some applications include thousands, tens of thousands, or even millions of lines of code. Unless progress improves dramatically, a substantial number of mission-critical systems will not be compliant in time. If they do, the impact of Year 2000 failures could be widespread, costly, and potentially disruptive to vital government operations worldwide.. FAA must determine how to ensure continuity of critical operations in the likely event of some systems’ failures. renovating mission-critical mainframe software, certain areas of risk in its Year 2000 program remained. Many of the states’ Disability Determination Service systems still had to be renovated, tested, and deemed Year 2000 compliant. More attention needs to be devoted to ensuring that the government has a complete and accurate picture of Year 2000 progress, he says. If priorities are not clearly set, the government may well end up wasting limited time and resources in fixing systems that have little bearing on the most vital government operations. need to set priorities. Canada has established 48 national priorities covering areas such as national defense, food production, safety, and income security. Business continuity and contingency planning across the government has been inadequate. Only four agencies reported that they had drafted contingency plans for their core business processes. Without such plans, when unpredicted failures occur, agencies will not have well-defined responses and may not have enough time to develop and test alternatives. One weak link anywhere in the chain of critical dependencies can cause major disruptions to business operations. whether these systems are owned by the agency. Our recently issued guidance aims to help agencies ensure such continuity of operations through contingency planning. Third, OMB’s assessment of the current status of federal Year 2000 progress is predominantly based on agency reports that have not been consistently reviewed or verified. In fact, we have found cases in which agencies’ systems compliance status as reported to OMB has been inaccurate. In May 1998, the Department of Agriculture reported (USDA) 15 systems as compliant, even though these were replacement systems that were still under development or planned for development. plans to remove these systems from compliant status in its next quarterly report. Fourth, end-to-end testing responsibilities have not yet been defined. Agency must work early and continually with their data exchange partners to plan and execute effective end- to-end tests. We have set forth a structured approach to testing in our recently released exposure draft. It includes requiring agencies to develop contingency plans for all critical core requiring agency to develop an independent verification strategy to involve inspectors general or other independent organizations in reviewing Year 2000 progress. processes and supporting systems is performed. State and local governments also face a major risk of Year 2000-induced failures to the many vital services they provide. For example, food stamps and other types of payments may not be made or could be made for an incorrect amount. Date-dependent signal timing patterns could be incorrectly implemented at highway intersections. Safety severely compromised, if traffic signal systems run by local governments run by state and local government are not properly tested. The report was published by the Government Accountability Office and the Chief Information Officers Council. Recent surveys of state Year 2000 efforts have indicated that much remains to be completed. Only about one-third of the states reported that 50 percent or more of their critical systems had been completely assessed, remediated, and tested. To effectively manage their Year 2000 projects, state and local governments must perform the same types of activities as the federal government, says John Sutter, author of "Year 2000: A Guide for States and U.S. Agencies’ New Year 2000 Efforts" Texas' Office of the State Auditor recently reported on the state’s efforts to remediate its embedded systems. The State Auditor found that many state entities had not finished their embedded systems inventories and, therefore, it is not likely that they will complete their embedded system repairs before the year 2000. To address these concerns, the report noted that (1) many entities lacked contingency plans in case theirembedded systems fail, (2) several entities cited a lack of funds as a barrier to embedded systems repair efforts, and (3) no entity is responsible for coordinating and reporting on statewide embedded system repair efforts. Office of the State Auditor also made recommendations, such as the Texas Year 2000 Project Office including embedded systems in its Year 2000 contingency plan requirements. For example, Illinois’ Office of the Auditor General reported that significant future efforts were needed to ensure that the year 2000 would not adversely affect state government operations. Vermont’s Office of Auditor of Accounts reported that the state faces the risk that critical portions of its Year2000 compliance efforts could fail. Florida’S Auditor General has issued several reports detailing the need for additional Year 2000 planning at various district school boards and community colleges. As computers play an ever-increasing role in our society, exchanging data electronically has become a common method of transferring information among federal, state, and local governments. As computer systems are converted to process Year 2000 dates, the associated data exchanges must also be made Year 2000 compliant. To successfully remediate their data exchanges, federal agencies and the states must assess information systems to identify data exchanges that are not year 2000 compliant, authors say. They also say states must reach agreement on the date format to be used in the exchange. federal agencies and states in implementing Year 2000 compliant data exchanges. In summary, federal, state, and local efforts must increase substantially to ensure that major service disruptions do not occur. Greater leadership and partnerships are essential if government programs are to meet the needs of the public at the turn of the century. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.

Summary:
The major federal securities laws that form the basis for the regulation of securities in the United States were enacted in the wake of the stock market crash of 1929. These acts include the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Investment Company Act of 1940. Other important securities acts were passed late in the 20 th century and early in the 21 st century. The Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984, the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank), the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012. The Securities Act of 1933 makes it illegal to offer or sell securities to the public. A registration statement becomes effective twenty days after it is filed with the commission. The registration statement consists of two parts: the prospectus and the exhibits. Certain transactions and securities are exempted from the registration process under the 1933 Act. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is concerned with the ongoing process of disclosure to the investing public through the filing of periodic and updated reports with the SEC. The Investment Company Act of 1940 was enacted to protect investors who use others to manage and diversify their investments. "Insider trading" is the term used to refer to trading in the securities markets while in possession of "material" information. Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988 expanded the scope of civil penalties to control persons who fail to take adequate steps to prevent insider trading. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 was enacted to address the perceived problem of an increase in frivolous shareholder lawsuits.investment adviser. An investment adviser may be registered by filing specified information with the SEC. The SEC may bring an action in U.S. district court to seek a civil penalty. The penalty may be up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided. stated reasons for bringing these lawsuits were varied. Some of the lawsuits had merit because some corporate managers had misled or defrauded investors. Some lawsuits were deemed frivolous and were brought when, for example, the share value of a corporation went down for reasons having nothing to do with the culpability of corporate managers. The act limits shareholder lawsuits in federal courts by such actions as having the court appoint a lead plaintiff determined to be the most capable of adequately representing the interests of class members. It also guarantees that plaintiffs receive full disclosure of settlement terms. The Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (SLUSA) was enacted in response to the perceived failure of the Private securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA) PSLRA had set out a framework for bringing securities fraud cases in federal courts. SLUSA attempted to make certain that plaintiffs could not avoid the PSLra requirements by allowing a securities fraud case to be brought only in a federal court and only under a uniform standard if five criteria are satisfied. The lawsuit is a covered class action. The claim is based on state statutory or common law. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 had its genesis early in 2002 after the declared bankruptcy of the Enron Corporation. The act establishes a Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which is supervised by the SEC. It also requires additional disclosures for public companies and the officers and directors of those companies. Among the other issues affected by the act are securities fraud, internal assessment of the companies, and internal audit of the public companies that are audited by accounting firms. It became law after the WorldCom scandal became known in late June 2002. Dodd-Frank effected the most significant changes to financial regulation since laws enacted in response to the Great Depression of 1929. Title VII of Dodd-Frank concerns the regulation of the over-the-counter swaps markets. Title IX, "Investor Protections and Improvements in the Regulation of Securities," sets out new powers of the SEC. Title XV requires the SEC to issue rules involving the disclosure by publicly traded companies of various minerals originating near the Democratic Republic of the Congo that are benefiting armed groups in the area. amends various titles of the U.S. Code, such as titles 5, 7, and 15, to prohibit Members of Congress and employees of Congress from trading stocks based on inside information. The JOBS Act is intended to encourage the funding of small businesses and startups by easing various securities reporting requirements. Among its seven titles, Title I, concerning emerging growth companies, and Title III, concerning crowdfunding, may be of special note. An emerging growth company, defined to apply to a company with a market capitalization of more than $1 million, is considered a growth company. Title III exempts certain companies from the 1933 Securities Act's registration requirements if various requirements are met. The companies are allowed to phase in various SEC regulations over a period of time and may confidentially submit to the SEC a draft registration statement for nonpublic review prior to public filing. The company must have.total annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion, is allowed to.phase in certain SEC regulations, and is allowed. to submit a draft. registration statement to theSEC fornonpublic review. must be sold through a funding portal, such as a website. must be sold to the public through a website or other form of public funding.

Summary:
In cases of significant differences with the President over foreign policy, especially deployments of U.S. military forces abroad, Congress has generally found that use of its Constitutionally-based "power of the purse" to be the most effective way to compel a President to take actions. Congress has used funding cutoffs or significant restrictions on the use of funds as a means of ending or circumscribing use of military personnel for foreign operations. During the last years of the Vietnam War era, Congress used such cutoffs and restrictions to curtail or terminate the President's use of US military force abroad. There were a number of efforts in Congress to restrict military actions by the United States in the Indochina region. Nearly all of these proposals did not pass more than one House of Congress due to vigorous opposition from the President to them. Those that did succeed in enactment into law are as follows: On December 22, 1970, Congress cleared the Special Foreign Assistance Act of 1971. On July 1, 1973, the President signed H.R. 9055 , P.L. 93-50 ; 87 Stat 99, the second Supplemental Appropriations Act for FY1973. More recent examples of congressional funding limitations aimed at preventing or reducing U.S. military deployments overseas relate to Somalia and to Rwanda. Since its enactment in 1973, there is no specific instance when the Congress has successfully utilized the War Powers Resolution. Every President from President Nixon forward has taken the position that the Warpowers Resolution is an unconstitutional infringement on the authority of the President, as Commander-in-Chief, to utilize the Armed Forces of the United States. Within one year of enactment.within one year after enactment. President Reagan signed P.L. 98-119 on October 12, 1983. 241 U.S. Marines in Lebanon were killed on October 23, 1983 by a suicide truck bombing. On February 7, 1984, President Reagan announced the Marines would be redeployed. On March 30, 1984,. reported to Congress that U.s. participation in the Multinational Force in Lebanon had ended. It is also important to note that President Reagan signed the resolution after the Marines had been killed. President Bush deployed U.S. military personnel to Saudi Arabia in 1990s. Bush's actions were taken without express authorization by Congress. In 1991, Congress passed H.J.Res. 77, Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq. President Bush signed bill on January 14, 1991, but didn't say he needed Congress' support for his actions, author says. He says he did not characterize request for "congressional support" for actions as a request for authorization of them. Controversy over U.S. military involvement in Kosovo led to an effort to use the War Powers Resolution as a means to address the question of whether the President could order combat activity abroad in the absence of Congressional authorization. Congress also attempted to use denial of funding for the Kosovo operation. Part, characterized its action as a requisite "authorization" for the President to take military action abroad. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 1569 on April 28, 1999, by a vote of 249-180. The Senate tabled S.J.Res. 20 on May 4, 1999. area of hostilities occur after 60 days in the absence of congressional authorization to continue, or a presidential request to Congress for an extra 30 day period to safely withdraw. The President did not seek such a 30 day extension, noting instead that the War Powers Resolution is constitutionally defective. Although not directly analogous to efforts to seek withdrawal of American military forces from abroad by use of funding cutoffs, Congress has used funding restrictions to limit or prevent foreign activities of a military or paramilitary nature. As such, these actions represent alternative actions. Controversy over U.S. covert assistance to paramilitary forces in Angola led to legislative bans on such action. Congress provided for a ban in permanent law in the International Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Act of 1976. In 1984, controversy over assistance to the opponents of the Nicaraguan government led to a prohibition on such assistance in a continuing appropriations bill. This legislative ban is summarized below. The continuing appropriations resolution for FY1985, P.L. 98-473 , 98 Stat 1935-1937, provided that no funds available to the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, or any other agency or entity of the United States. after February 28, 1985, if the President made a report to Congress specifying certain criteria, including the need to provide further assistance for "military or paramilitary operations" prohibited by this statute, he could expend $14 million in funds. If Congress passed a joint resolution approving such action, the President could spend the money. The President could use the money to pay for military operations that were prohibited by the statute. The funds could be spent on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, or elsewhere in the world.

Summary:
EPA has initiated actions that would substantially reduce air pollutants (particularlynitrogenoxides - NOx) emitted by some electric generating facilities. The initiatives would further control NOx to assist states in the Northeast in meeting the existing, statutory 1-hourozoneNational Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) The Ozone Transport Rule includes all or part of 19 easternstates and the District of Columbia. The enforcement initiative is not legally or procedurally related to the above initiatives. Call is the most wideranging of the initiatives, with estimated costs of $1.7 billion annually and estimated quantifiable benefits of$1.1-$4.2billion annually. Because EPA's methodology uses cost-effectiveness for determining emission budgets, the lion'sshare of the costs would be borne by the utility industry. The smaller scope of the Section 126 determinations reducesemissionsabatement and benefits, but also costs. Of course, this scope could increase if additional petitions submitted to EPAresultin more states being implicated as sources of transported ozone. In January 2000, EPA decided to indefinitely stay its original final determinations with respect to the 8-hour ozone standard. In February 2001, the Supreme Court ruled that although EPA has the authority to set a new 8- hour ozone standard, itsinterpretation of the relationship between the 1-hour standard's statutory implementation strategy and its new 8 hour standard was unreasonable and unlawful. On January 15, 2002, the EPA announced itwould delay the compliance deadline for the Section 126 rule from May 1, 2003, to May 31, 2004, in line with thedeadlinefor the NOx SIP Call. impact of the Bush Administration's June 2002 recommendations to revise the New Source Review process.

Summary:
PSI is a multinational effort to prevent the trafficking of WMD, their delivery systems, and related materials. U.S. agencies are involved in the PSI as a set of activities, rather than a program. International participation is voluntary, and there are no binding treaties on those who choose to participate. According to the principles, PSI participants use existing national and international authorities to put an end to WMD-related trafficking and take steps to strengthen those authorities, as necessary, State says. The administration has not issued a directive to U.S. agencies that perform PSI functions to take actions to expand and strengthen PSI. The administration issued a required PSI implementation report to Congress in July 2008, 5 months after the mandated issuance date of February 2008. The report does not fully specify the steps taken to implement GAO’s previous recommendations or other provisions of the law. The agency has not submitted a PSI budget report for fiscal year 2009 detailing PSI-related expenditures in the past 3 fiscal years. State and U.S. law enforcement agencies do not all have the policies, procedures, or budgets in place to facilitate their participation in PSI activities. DOD has taken more steps to address some of the law’s provisions, such as establishing clearer PSI policies and procedures, structures, and budgets, compared with other agencies such as State and law Enforcement agencies. U.s. agencies have not established performance indicators to measure the results of PSi activities. The revised Joint Staff guidance does not clearly address some areas of COCOM responsibility. State placed responsibility for PSI in the Office of Counter Proliferation Initiatives. The FBI has budgeted $40,000 to support staff travel costs to PSI meetings and exercises for fiscal year 2008. The Coast Guard has not established a PSI funding line and uses operational funds to travel. PSI exercises, multilateral PSI planning meetings and workshops are focused on law enforcement issues, including customs, and legal authorities to detain and detain cargo of shipboardings and cargo inspections. These officials said that law enforcement agencies are key participants in PSI activities. countries, instead of their militaries, are increasingly participating in PSI exercises. According to agency officials, it can be challenging to find countries willing to exercise PSI law enforcement issues with the U.S. military. Constitutions or political considerations of some countries preclude their military’s involvement in exercises with a law enforcement component. For example, one COCOM planned to add a PSI component into an existing DOD military exercise, but the foreign country participants refused to allow such a component to be added. None of the agencies participating in PSI activities has established performance indicators to measure the results of their activities. U.S. agencies have not built and expanded relationships in the same way with their counterparts from the more than 70 PSI countries who are not invited to these meetings. According to DOD, multilateral PSI planning meetings are to be held three to four times annually as delegations from 20 leading PSi countries (including the United States) meet to consider ways to enhance WMD interdiction capabilities of PSI participants. consent to board and search each other’s vessels suspected of carrying WMD and related materials. Since PSI was announced in 2003, the U.S. has signed a total of nine PSI shipboarding agreements. In addition, the United States helped negotiate an amendment to the Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation. The amendment created an international framework for nations that are party to the amended convention to board ships believed to be engaged in WMD proliferation. U.S. agencies, with other members of the International Civil Aviation Organization, are currently examining ways to amend the Montreal Convention of 1971. The FBI sponsored a workshop in 2006 to train law enforcement officials from the 19 other leading PSI countries to identify WMD items. According to State and DOD officials, the departments have not developed a formal, written strategy to resolve interdiction issues. The administration has only partially addressed the provisions of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. State concurred with our second recommendation, recognizing the need to deepen the involvement and knowledge of all PSI endorsing countries. State maintained that a PSI directive is not necessary to strengthen and expand PSI because an existing WMD interdiction process created by a classified National Security Presidential Directive is sufficient. State said that foremost among future plans of the leading PSI countries that attend the multilateral meetings is to focus on regional PSI activities and outreach workshops to increase the participation of those PSi countries who are not invited to attend. the number of countries endorsing PSI, the number and complexity of PSI exercises, and the conclusion of PSi shipboarding agreements as indicators to measure PSI performance. A good internal control environment calls for agencies to create their own means to monitor and evaluate their own efforts to identify areas needing improvement. We reaffirm the recommendation from our 2006 report that DOD and State should better organize their efforts for performing PSI activities. It is not feasible or effective to develop a single comprehensive written strategy to deal with issues arising after interdictions because every interdiction must be dealt with on a case-by- case basis. that are beyond the control of the United States, as noted in our 2006 classified report. State also stated that it has policies and procedures in place for PSI activities, although they are not recorded in a single document. We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional committees. We also will make copies available to others on request. In addition, this report will be available at no charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-8979. We assessed the extent to which the administration issued a PSI directive, a sense of Congress provision in the law, and submitted to Congress required PSI- related reports. We reviewed various documents produced by the U.S. delegation to multilateral PSI planning meetings. We interviewed officials and military personnel at five DOD Combatant Commands (COCOM) We discussed how DOD manages and coordinates its involvement in PSI activities, including preparation and execution of PSI components within existing DOD exercises, as well as stand-alone PSI exercises. The PSI is a response to the growing challenges posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), their delivery systems, and related materials worldwide. PSI participants are deeply concerned about this threat and of the danger that these items could fall into the hands of terrorists. The increasingly aggressive efforts by proliferators to stand outside or to circumvent existing nonproliferation norms, and to profit from such trade, requires new and stronger actions by the international community. They call on all states concerned with this threat to international peace and security to join in similarly committing to interdiction efforts. The following multilateral PSI planning meetings are also known as Operational Expert Group (OEG) meetings: 1. Brisbane, Australia (July) 2. Paris, France (September) 4. London, United Kingdom (October) 5. Washington, D.C., United States (December) 1. Ottawa, Canada (April) 2, Oslo, Norway (August) 3, Copenhagen, Denmark ( July) 3. Hamburg, Germany (November) – Regional OEG meeting 1. Auckland, New Zealand (March) 2,. Rhodes, Greece ( October) GAO: U.S. Agencies Have Taken Some Steps, but More Effort Is Needed to Strengthen and Expand the Proliferation Security Initiative. DOD and State should take steps to increase cooperation and coordination between the United States and the more than 70 PSI countries who are not invited to multilateral PSI planning meetings. GAO Statement: The Administration has not issued a PSI directive that directs agencies to establish clear PSI authorities, responsibilities, policies and procedures, including budget requests for PSI activities. strategy to resolve interdiction issues. U.S. agencies have developed tools and use standard procedures to plan and execute interdictions, officials say. "We have not found it feasible or effective to develop a single, comprehensive written strategy," they say. Each case is unique and must be dealt with on a case-by-case basis depending on the specific circumstances, they add. The involvement of the U.s. delegation at the multilateral meetings is part of an attempt to resolve these issues. State has an existing structure but does not have policies, procedures, or a budget in place for PSI activities. The PSI is based on the concept of cooperation and coordination among PSI partners in countering WMD- related trafficking. State updates its PSI plans and strategies frequently to take developments into account. State has provided funding to support four complex interdiction-related PSI exercises hosted by PSi partners Poland and Ukraine, as authorized under section 504(a) of the FREEDOM Support Act. meetings of the 20-nation OEG are not based on or involved with establishing legal obligations, so it is meaningless to refer to compliance mechanisms in this context. The operational experts meet to discuss and resolve issues related to interdictions, and to plan exercises and outreach events. This forum for experts to meet regularly with their counterparts from other countries has proven very valuable for strengthening the PSI network. We are working on ways to expand the benefits of the OEG to all PSI countries by holding more regionally-focused meetings. GAO: Existing WMD interdiction process covers how U.S. agencies should coordinate efforts. GAO: Process predates creation of PSI and does not cover PSI involvement in three broad PSI activities: multilateral planning meetings, exercises, and other outreach efforts. State has not worked with DOD to implement the second recommendation from our 2006 report, as called for in the law, GAO says. State said that it has PSI policies and procedures that are not recorded in a single document. PSI exercises, State has not requested funds necessary for PSI-related activities, as called for in the law. This statement was based on information from U.S. agency officials. We have added information to the report noting the 2009 PSI events DOD will be sponsoring. In addition to the individual named above, Godwin Agbara, Assistant Director; Ian Ferguson; Yana Golburt; Helen Hwang; and Lynn Cothern made key contributions to this report. The following are GAO's comments on the Department of Defense’s letter dated October 10, 2008.

Summary:
VA’s mission is to promote the health, welfare, and dignity of all veterans. The department relies extensively on IT to meet the day-to-day operational needs of its medical centers. VHA provides health care services, including primary care and specialized care, and it performs research and development to improve veterans’ needs. VBA provides a variety of benefits to veterans and their families, including disability compensation, educational opportunities, assistance with home ownership, and life insurance. NCA provides burial and memorial benefits. Since 2007, VA has been operating a centralized organization in which most key functions intended for effective management of IT are performed by OI&T. Figure 2 presents a simplified organizational chart for VA. Office provides strategy and technical direction, guidance, and policy related to how IT resources are to be acquired and managed for the department. The CIO is expected to serve as the principal advisor to top management officials, such as the Under Secretaries of each of the three administrations, on matters relating to IT management. The organization is intended to improve both service delivery and the veteran experience. The organization is to institute a data governance strategy and engage with VA staff to ensure the accuracy and security of collected data. OI&T also intends for the organization to identify trends in the data collected on each veteran that could improve their health care by providing predictive care and anticipating needs. This function is responsible for establishing an approach to fulfilling the department’s requirements with vendors that provide solutions to those requirements, managing vendor selection, tracking vendor performance and contract deliverables. The VA Under Secretary for Health is the head of VHA. The Strategic Investment Management office was established to support VHA's IT needs. This office advocates for VHA’s IT needs within the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution process. The office also works with program offices such as Pharmacy Benefits Management Services, Veterans Access to Care (scheduling and consults), and Community Care. The Executive Director of this office is responsible for identifying functional needs for medical center pharmacies and consolidated mail outpatient pharmacies. The VA health care system is in danger of becoming obsolete, says the VA Commission on Care. The commission’s recommendations were intended to serve as a foundation for organizational transformation at VA. The department generally concurred with our recommendations, but has not provided information about its actions to implement four of the six recommendations, the commission says. VA has established IT management processes that are partially consistent with leading IT practices, the report says. But these plans do not include metrics that the department could use to track performance. VHA has an IT investment management process that is consistent with leading practices. VA’s department-level IT investment board has been inactive and investment selection criteria have not been defined. VA has taken steps to show alignment between the IT strategic goals and objectives and the VA Strategic Plan. An IT strategic plan outlines the agency's goals and identifies performance metrics that permit the agency to determine whether IT is making a difference in improving performance. The resulting plan effectively guides modernization efforts by serving as an agency's vision and road map. OI&T produced these strategic plans, road maps, and supplementary guidance related to IT. None of the documents includes specific results-oriented performance metrics that are called for by VA’s IT strategic planning directive and leading practices. VHA has taken steps to define a strategic direction for health IT by issuing its Health Information Strategic Plan for Veterans Health Administration Supporting VA Health Care Version 4.3 (HISP) According to the HISP, this strategy is to inform OI &T’S IRM Strategic Plan. VA has taken steps to establish a systematic and organized approach to IT investment management. The department has integrated its investment management approach with its IT Multi-Year Programming cycle. Within VHA, the administration has developed a governance structure for prioritizing business needs and selecting its IT investments based on those needs. VHA’s Architecture and Requirements Investment Work Group supports these governance boards by normalizing and analyzing the submitted IT needs and providing data and cost estimates to help the governance bodies make informed decisions. evolving process and they plan to continue to improve the process for selecting IT investments and the budgeting process as the department builds the upcoming fiscal year 2019 through fiscal year 2023 budget submissions. Without using a department-level board to govern IT investments, the department risks wasting limited resources and funding investments that may not fully support VHA’s most important business functions and priorities. Leading enterprise architecture and investment management practices maintain that enterprise architecture can be used to link the organization's strategic mission value (performance results and outcomes) to its technical resources. The VA Business Function Framework is the architectural model that describes the core business functions that are necessary to the mission of delivering health care. VASI shows that the vast majority of VHA’s 262 core business. functions are supported by current IT systems or, according to department. officials, do not have a need for system support. VHA had 2,772 requests for IT needs documented in the NSR database since 1998. Of these, approximately 817 were open requests—IT needs identified throughout VHA that had not been met. Database consists of requests ranging from the creation or modification of reports to the development of new systems. Pharmacy benefits management, scheduling, and community care all have open requests that represent long-standing, unmet IT needs. These programs are responsible for key functions and IT systems related to health service delivery. As of November 2016, the program office tracked more than 280 open requests to meet IT needs, approximately 38 percent of which were identified 5 or more years ago. The office had a request from 2000 for an inpatient pharmacy order interface to share pharmacy order information with external and commercial systems. VA spends a significant amount of money on sustaining existing systems, which has limited the funds available for enhancing or modernizing those systems. VA’s partial implementation of effective IT strategic planning, investment management, and enterprise architecture has put the department at risk of being unable to fully support VHA with the information systems it needs to perform its mission of providing high- quality health care to veterans. Weaknesses in key processes leave VA unable to gauge the extent to which it is providing information systems that meet VHA's needs. The objectives of this study were to determine the extent to which the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) (1) information technology (IT)appropriately documented and effectively implemented. The report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staffs have any questions on matters discussed in this report, please contact me at (202) 512-9286 or pownerd@gao,gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. management processes are consistent with leading practices and (2) current IT systems support the Veterans Health Administration’s (VHA) core business functions. To address the first objective, we compared VA's IT management processes for IT strategic planning, investment management, and enterprise architecture to leading practices that federal statutes, prior GAO reports, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) have identified. This comparison focused on the specific aspects of the processes that are intended to ensure that IT investments meet the business needs of the VHA organization. We analyzed department data to understand how VA might demonstrate that its IT systems are designed to meet its objectives. We compared this list of core business functions to data in the VA Systems Inventory (VASI) database. There were 5 functions (from a total of 262 functions) that could not be reconciled. We determined that this number, which represented less than 2 percent of the total number of functions, was not significant to our findings. We analyzed data from VHA’s new service request (NSR) database, which captures information related to business needs such as IT enhancements. NSR database to identify the number of requests in the database, when requests were entered. Analysis could not provide insight into the depth of work required for requests themselves, nor the weight the business owners assigned to each open need. NSR database does not include data on the importance, level of impact, and work effort required to address each request. For each data set, we reviewed documentation related to the databases, such as the data dictionary, tested the data sets to look for duplicate records and missing data in key fields. relationship between data elements. We also interviewed department officials about data reliability and internal controls procedures for the database. We conducted additional analyses of three programs related to health service delivery on which we have previously reported. The results of this analysis are not generalizable to all functional areas, but provide insight into the extent of IT support for VHA programs.. We interviewed cognizant officials from VHA regarding the IT systems used by the three programs, the needs identification and management process, and about the extent to which VHA business needs are being addressed. for the three specific programs.

Summary:
Claims representatives at SSA field offices are responsible for processing all applications and determining the amount of monthly SSI payments. SSA uses both financial eligibility reviews, known as redeterminations, and computer matching to identify and prevent overpayments. No computer matches are done that could identify unreported or underreported income from the Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) and workers’ compensation (WC) programs. In 1994, SSA began establishing on-line connections between its field offices and state agencies that had automated databases that could easily be linked to SSA's computer system. Some states may not want to grant SSA on-line access because of privacy concerns. Others may refuse to negotiate the necessary agreements until SSA grants reciprocal access. SSA has not tracked the costs it has incurred when making the necessary changes to its systems to implement on-LINE access. Some states that do not have fully automated data are willing to explore giving SSA access in exchange for SSA sharing the costs of automating their data, the authors say. They believe it is possible to develop a system that would minimize the possibility of accessing personal data for unofficial use. copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.

Summary:
In every war fought by the United States, civilian ships have supported military operations by transporting supplies and personnel. The civilians that have served on these vessels historically have worked in varying capacities either for private shipping companies under contract with the federal government or for the government itself. These civilians are collectively referred to as merchant mariners. In World War II, an estimated 8,500 merchant mariner were killed and 11,000 were wounded. During Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, it is estimated that 63% of the military cargo shipped to the Middle East and Afghanistan was delivered by U.S.-flagged commercial vessels. Considered veterans for the purposes of federal benefits. Currently, only limited groups of World War II-era merchant mariners are eligible for benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs. No legislation was enacted in the immediate aftermath of World war II to grant veteran status to merchantMariners. Section 401 of the GI Bill Improvement Act of 1977 ( P.L. 95-202 ) granted veterans' benefit to merchantmariners. H.R. 476, introduced in 1947, would have expanded the existing benefits for merchant seamen related to health care and disability. P.L. 95-202 extended "active duty" status to civilians who served as Women's Air Forces Service Pilots (WASPS) during World War II. The Secretary of Defense has the authority to extend active duty status for the purpose of eligibility for federal veterans' benefits to other groups of civilian federal employees or contractors. The factors to be used in reviewing such applications included the uniqueness of service rendered by the group and whether or not the group was subject to military control, discipline, and justice. In 1982, the Secretary of the Air Force rejected the application for active duty status for oceangoing merchant mariners who served during World War II. In 1985, the. Secretary rejected the applications of merchant mariner who served in contested waters in World War. II, merchant mar Mariners involved in any military invasion during World. War II, and all merchantmariners involved in Operation Mulberry during World war II. These rejections were recommended by the Civilian/Military Service Review Board. Lawsuit challenged denial of active duty status for World War II oceangoing merchant mariners and those who participated in World War Two invasions. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that the Secretary of the Air Force erred in rejecting the applications. No other merchant mariner is eligible for any veterans' benefits administered by the VA. In addition, those with service-connected disabilities or medical conditions may have lost out on nearly 40 years of compensation or medical benefits.  merchant mariners would join Medal of Honor winners as the only groups eligible for cash compensation from the VA. They would not have to demonstrate a financial hardship or a service-connected disability to receive cash compensation. The VA would pay for these lost benefits. The bill is expected to be voted on in the next few months and could be signed into law by the end of the year or early next year. For more information on the bill, go to: http://www.va.gov/va-pension-benefits.

Summary:
Poverty estimates are used to determine funding allocations for a variety of programs. This report discusses poverty measures developed for official, research, and administrative uses. It does not address international poverty measures, current poverty estimates, or policy responses for alleviating poverty. A family's income is compared against a dollar amount representing some measure of need, called a threshold. Those with family income less than the threshold are considered to be "in poverty," or poor. The poverty measures discussed in this report focus on financial resources. in this report focus entirely on economic needs and resources. This is only one way to assess a person's level of well-being. Other characteristics are also important to consider. These include the possession of amenities or access to public services, access to quality housing and neighborhood conditions and community services, such as public safety and quality local schools. Other indicators of well being include economic mobility (the degree to which persons at the low end of the income distribution can move higher in it) and access to opportunities for high paying jobs. The Census Bureau releases data from the official poverty measure every September for the previous full calendar year. Poverty data are obtained from surveys, and are therefore estimates that have margins of error. "Resources" in this measure are defined as money income before taxes, and they do not include the valuation of noncash benefits like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and housing subsidies. The official measure's equivalence scale was not computed directly, but rather came about implicitly because the thresholds were based on. The 1964 Economic Report of the President used a flat figure of $3,000 for families, and $1,500 for individuals not in families, to represent the poverty line. Research on poverty measurement using a more detailed measure of need began before the Johnson Administration announced the War on Poverty. In the early 1960s, Mollie Orshansky had been conducting her own analysis of poverty using food costs. The Economy Food Plan indicated the money a family under economic stress would need to spend on food for "temporary or emergency use when funds are low" For two-person families, a factor of 3.7, rather than 3, was used in order to capture the higher fixed costs faced by smaller families. Income amounts for individuals not in families were set at 80% of the amounts for two- person families. Apart from three minor methodological revisions, the above methodology undergirds the official poverty thresholds as they are used today. They are updated for inflation annually using the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). Poverty measurement, in general, involves a comparison of resources to a measure of need. The CPS ASEC uses a detailed questionnaire administered by trained representatives. Because the information comes from household surveys, there are limitations to which populations can be measured. The information used to identify family relationships comes from house surveys, and varies from survey to survey. The CPS AS EC is used for the official poverty estimates for the nation as a whole, and asks about the relationships among all household members. It is conducted primarily for the purposes of measuring the state of the nation's economic well-being. for households, but also includes some noninstitutional group quarters, such as emergency shelters and group homes. Military personnel are included only if they live in a household with at least one civilian adult. Foster children under age 15 who have not been legally adopted are excluded. Unmarried domestic partners are regarded as belonging to separate family units in the official definition of poverty, and their poverty statuses are computed accordingly. The family relationship data available through the survey can thus affect how individuals' poverty status is determined. The official poverty measure represented an improvement from the flat amounts used in the 1964 Economic Report of the President. The poverty thresholds are not adjusted to reflect geographic variations in costs. The official measure captures the effects of some but not all government programs intended to provide relief for the poor. The programs that are captured are those based on money income before taxes: Social Security, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and other programs that help the poor pay for their basic necessities. It represents an important disconnection between the way needs were specified and the definition of resources available for meeting those needs. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and any state or local relief programs based on money income. Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which, despite its large effects for low-income workers, is not captured because it is a tax credit. SNAP, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), public housing subsidies, and subsidized medical care. The official measure does not capture the needs incurred, nor the resources brought in, by household members who are not related by birth, marriage, or adoption. shifted in relation to all goods and services. It can be argued that the inflation adjustment used in the official measure does not accurately reflect the purchasing power needed, in a practical sense, to remain comparable with those at the poverty line in previous decades. There has been broad agreement among poverty scholars that the limitations noted above represent serious drawbacks to the official poverty measure. Experts within the federal government, in universities, and in private research institutions have spent decades developing approaches to address these shortcomings. In 2009, the Office of Management and Budget convened an Interagency Technical Working Group (ITWG) to consolidate the research. measure, nor did it recommend using the Supplemental Poverty Measure for administrative purposes. The thresholds were defined by costs of food, clothing, shelter, and utilities, and a bit extra to cover miscellaneous expenses. Three sets of thresholds were developed for renters, homeowners with a mortgage, and homeowners without. The measure's methodology was designed to be practical to implement, with the understanding that its methods would continue to be refined periodically, as new data source availability and research findings warranted. It was developed following recommendations made by a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) panel. a mortgage—to take account of housing costs, given that it can vary widely between these groups. The thresholds are geographically adjusted using housing data from the American Community Survey (ACS) The equivalence scale for the new thresholds uses three factors to adjust for family size: children on average consume less than adults; as family size increases, some expenses like food or clothing increase additively with each person; and the first child in a single-parent family represents a greater increase in costs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) computes the base thresholds using CE data. The official poverty measure gained its status through the Bureau of the Budget's Circular A-46, issued in 1969. OMB issued Statistical Policy Directive 14 in 1978, reconfirming the measure as official and directing federal agencies to use it for statistical purposes. The Supplemental Poverty Measure's overall effect on the poverty rate made it approximately 0.6 percentage points higher than the official rate in 2015. The profile of the population in poverty is different between the supplemental and official measures, as evidenced by noticeably higher poverty rates for some groups and lower rates for others. The official poverty measure, as described in OMB's Statistical Policy Directive 14, is based on data from the CPS ASEC. Since the 1960s, however, other datasets have been used to compute poverty status. The Decennial Census of Population and Housing was, for decades, the only available data source that could provide information on poverty for small geographic areas, such as cities and counties. The Census Bureau now releases poverty data every September from the ASEC for the prior full calendar year. The ACS provides more detail on demographic characteristics for small areas than any other data source. The ACS was designed to be filled out by the respondent on his or her own. It does not capture information on people who may be related to each other but not to the householder. Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) establishes formula grants for local education agencies based, in part, on the ACS' results. The CPS asks about fewer income sources than does the ACS. The SAIPE program was undertaken in the 1990s to provide poverty estimates for counties, and estimates of the number of school-age children in poverty for school districts. The data are model-based, meaning that they are not simply a reflection of survey responses, but are adjusted using a combination of administrative data in addition to survey data. The modeling enables the Census Bureau to produce estimates for small areas with less variability—and thus greater precision—than it could using survey data alone. Since 2005, the first year that the ACS estimates were available at its full sample size of over 3 million addresses per year, ACS data have been used as input into the model. SAHIE data are also model-based estimates for small areas. However, they have a different target population: the low-income uninsured. The SAHIE estimates are broken down by income-to-poverty ratio, uninsured status, sex, age group, and, for state-level estimates, selected racial and Hispanic origin groups. The data are used to estimate the target population for the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, coordinated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Longitudinal poverty data have been available from the SIPP since 1984. The data sources discussed thus far can be thought of as snapshots illustrating the poverty population in a given year. Shown in Table 3 are sets of dollar amounts, called poverty guidelines, that are computed and published annually by the Department of Health and Human Services. Unlike the measures discussed in this report, the poverty guidelines are not used to count the number of people or families in poverty. Rather, they are used for administrative purposes, such as determining whether an individual or family qualifies for programmatic assistance.

Summary:
A history of the federal excise tax on tires shows that initial adoption occurred as a result of the revenue needs of World War I. Today's excise tax derives from the re-institution of the tax (at 2 1/4 cents per pound on tires) by the Revenue Act of 1932. Congress recognized that the very heavy weight of laminated tiresdisadvantaged this new small industry since the tax represented nearly 20% of the retail cost of thetire. In an effort to stimulate job creation, Congress passed the Surface TransportationAssistance Act of 1982. in the American Jobs CreationAct of 2004. The revenue effect was scored as being negligible. Also included inthis legislation is a requirement that the Internal Revenue Service collect revenuedata for each class of taxable tire beginning January 1, 2006. The Senate's version of the bill adds $11.2billion in additional revenues all of which is fully offset. It is argued that thisadditional revenue is needed so that all states will receive as much in federal highwayaid as they pay in federal gasoline excise taxes. funding authorization level ($283.9 billion oversix years) is not met. There are two main reasons why the tax is imposed upon the weight or loadcapacity rather than the sales price of tires. At the time of World War II, there simplywere no substitutes for rubber and no domestic rubber supply. Since rubber was anecessary commodity for the war effort, the imposition of this excise tax was used as a means to discourage domestic consumption. As such, the person using morerubber -- and heavier tires -- would shoulder a heavier tax burden than those personsconserving the valuable commodity. individuals because individuals withlower incomes tend to spend a larger portion of their income on these goods. Today, revenues from the excise tax on tires provide less than 2% of the Highway Trust Fund receipts.

Summary:
The academies are structured to provide a curriculum critical to the development of successful future officers. Approximately 4,000 students are enrolled at each of the three service academies at any one time. Each academy’s student population consists of about 15 percent women and 19 to 24 percent racial/ethnic minorities. The academies employ both civilian and military faculty, including military officers who serve as commanders to students at each academy.. Between 1993 and 1995, we issued a series of reports on student treatment at the three. academies. Survey of 9,238 students and faculty at three military service academies. Majority responded that quality-of-life problems are openly confronted and/or solved at their academies to some, little, or no extent. Students expressed mixed views on the practice of the honor code/concept on their campuses. Male students were more likely to be dissatisfied with their social life than female students, the survey found.. More actions were needed to eliminate sexual harassment and that disparities in the treatment of women and minorities existed at the academies, the review found. The perceptions of students on the emphasis the academies place on preventing race-/ethnicity-based discrimination also varied according to group membership. A large majority of all students rated the overall atmosphere for racial/ ethnic minorities as good or excellent. Student perceptions varied as to whether various groups of students, such as women, recruited athletes, and minorities, receive preferential treatment during the admissions process and in general. Many students at the three academies reported that they plan to stay in the military beyond their initial retirement. and performance, but they lack a complete oversight framework. We recommended that DOD improve its oversight by enhancing its performance goals and measures. The academies’ climate surveys are conducted periodically and can inform decision makers about areas that may warrant further attention. The results of our surveys, especially those areas mentioned above, may be of use to DOD in enhancing the quality of its oversight.

Summary:
Biofuels received significant federal support in the form of tax incentives, loan and grant programs, and regulatory programs. Many incentives for biofuels production and use expired at the end of 2011. The ongoing congressional debate over budget deficits and the national debt make the prospect of extending these incentives less likely. This report outlines 22 current, expired, or pending federal programs that provide direct or indirect incentives for Biofuels. The programs are grouped below by administering agency. The incentives are summarized in the Appendix. Several key biofuels incentives had expired or were set to expire. Gasoline suppliers who blend ethanol with gasoline are eligible for a tax credit of 45 cents per gallon of ethanol. Biodiesel producers (or producers of diesel/biodiesel blends) can claim a per-gallon tax credit through the end of 2011. The guaranteed market created by the renewable fuel standard is expected to stimulate growth of the biofuel industry and to raise prices above where they would have been in the absence of the mandate. A taxpayer may take a 30% credit for the installation of alternative fuel infrastructure, up to $30,000, including E85 (85% ethanol and 15% gasoline) infrastructure through the end of 2011. Residential installations qualify for a $1,000 credit (biofuels pumps are not generally installed in residential applications). Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBS) Annual funding: $74 million in mandatory spending for FY2009, $245 million for FY2010, and $150 million annually for FY 2009-FY2012. A 2.5% ad valorem tariff and a most-favored-nation duty of $0.54 per gallon of ethanol (for fuel use) applies to imports into the United States from most countries through the end of 2011. Most ethanol from Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries may be imported duty-free. Covered Entities: Fuel ethanol importers. Administered by: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Annual funding: N/A Established: 1975 by the Energy Policy. Automakers are required to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for their passenger cars and light trucks. Manufacturers may gain credits for the sale of alternative fuel vehicles, including ethanol/gasoline flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs) However, the credits are limited—the maximum fuel economy increase allowed through the use of these credits is 1.2 miles per gallon through model year (MY) 2014. The credits are phased out after MY2014 and are completely eliminated after MY2019.

Summary:
The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the U.S. prompted both sides of the Atlantic to reinvigorate their respective efforts to ensure homeland security and combat terrorism. This report examines homeland security measures in six selected European countries: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. None of these European countries currently has a single ministry or department equivalent to the United States Department of Homeland Security. Some analysts believe the EU should take a more active role in ensuring European homeland security, given the EU's largely open borders. U.S. policymakers and Members of Congress are taking an increasing interest in how European countries are organizing and managing homeland security issues and emergency preparedness. Some experts suggest that greater U.S.-European cooperation in the field of homeland security is necessary in order to better guarantee security on both sides of the Atlantic. After the Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, many European countries took steps to enhance security since September 11. The actions or inaction of the European allies can affect U.s. domestic security, especially given the U.N. Visa Waiver Program. Belgium showed early leadership in coordinating international counterterrorist activities. Belgium pushed within the Union for acceptance of EU-wide fast-track extradition procedures for serious crimes. Like other EU countries, Belgium has refused to deport suspected terrorists to countries where they might face the death penalty. Some observers believe that Brussels tends to place a great deal of emphasis on process, and, as a result, the government is slow and bureaucratic. In June 2002, the U.S. and Belgian governments initialed an agreement permitting U.K. Customs agents to be stationed in Antwerp. Until 1998, Belgian passports were issued by municipal officials. An estimated 3,500 passports were stolen annually from poorly-guarded city halls. The United States applied pressure, even indicating that it might begin requiring visas for Belgians. In 2004, Belgium became the first country to introduce biometric-based electronic passports; the new travel documents are compliant with both U.S. and EU requirements. In 2001, an article in the Wall Street Journal criticized Belgium for having "some of the weakest antiterrorism laws in the European Union[,] ... making it popular among terrorists as a place to hide out and plan attacks" Belgium's approach to homeland security is less unified than that adopted after 9/11. Belgium has no counterpart to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Individual components of homeland security, counter-terrorist, and emergency management responsibilities are spread throughout the government. Back burner in the 1980s. Back to Mail Online home. back to the page you came from. Click here to read the full article. Back To the pageyou came from, click here toread the full story. Belgium's prime minister has the main responsibility for the country's antiterrorism policy. The Council of Ministers handles the development of strategic policy toward counterterrorism. In 2002, Belgium spent a total of 4,109 million euros—an estimated 4,000 million euros. Like all government activities, funding for homeland security-related functions are negotiated among a four-party governing coalition of mixed ethnicity (French/Flemish) and ideology. In all its law enforcement activities, Belgium places a strong emphasis on civil rights. Spending on counter-terrorism activities has expanded in recent years to cover funding for a new intelligence and policing agency. The lead Belgian agency for emergency response is the General Directorate of Civil Defense. The Directorate coordinates activities among federal ministries and among the various levels of government. In the event of a major act of terrorism, the Directorate, along with the Crisis Center, would be responsible forEmergency response and communications with the populace. The Governmental Coordination and Crisis Center was created in 1988 to gather and analyze information about and provide continuous monitoring of accidents. Belgium's national police force is part of the Ministry of the Interior. The force is divided into five sections, which are responsible for administrative, judicial, and operational support. There are approximately 15,000 officers serving in the federal force, and about 28,000 employed by nearly 200 police departments at the local level. In 1994, Belgium created a cadre of international liaison officers of the federal police. The Crisis Center also is the Belgian government's main agency for responding to a terrorist event. Anti-terrorist and homeland security intelligence is handled by the State Security and General Intelligence Service under the Ministry of Justice. The Ministry of Defense's intelligence service may only be called into play when there is a military aspect to a certain case. Threat analysis is performed by a new agency, the OCAM/CODA ( Organe de coordination pour l ' analyse de la menace/Coördinatieorgaan voor de dreigingsanalyse ). This organization, which is expected to be fully operational in a year, is an umbrella group that coordinates intelligence and policing efforts. It collects information from various organizations (including state security, intelligence and police services, customs, the transportation office, the treasury, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) Belgium has also demonstrated an interest in wider sharing of intelligence within Europe. After the March 2004 terrorist bombings in Madrid, Belgium joined Austria in proposing the establishment of a European intelligence agency. Other EU members opposed this initiative on national sovereignty grounds. The Crisis Center is the principal agency for monitoring and responding to a terrorist event. Two organizations are responsible for investigating and preventing the financing of terrorism. France does not have a department of homeland security. Potential chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats from abroad are assessed by the Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs. Nuclear power plant security is split between the Interior Ministry and the Sub-directorate for Energy of the Ministry for Economics. While the United States has undertaken military action, France relies upon institutional practices in several ministries that have evolved over many years as a response to terrorist attacks. The French response to terrorism contrasts to that of the U.S. In France, with other EU governments, has concentrated on a response grounded in law enforcement. Long periods of political instability have also led to an emphasis on public order over civil liberties. France lacks the resources to undertake homeland security efforts comparable to those of the United States. In part to compensate for this relative lack of resources, the French government increasingly coordinates its anti-terror efforts with its EU partners, especially in border control. The Ministry of Interior (MOI) and Ministry of Defense (MOD) play key roles in managing the effort. France does not have a governmental entity comparable to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The Ministry of Interior is responsible for civil protection, and in most instances would manage a response to a terrorist threat or attack. France has 90 départements, or administrative regions, each led by a prefect who is an official of the central government in Paris. In 1986, a French law created special judicial and police authorities to respond to terrorism.. Unlike the United States, France uses the military domestically in extreme emergencies. levels, which can be activated by the president without legislative consent. The first level, "simple," is activated when a threat appears imminent. It remained in effect until the day after the attacks on the U.S. on September 11, 2001. At this level, President Chirac exercised his authority to direct the armed forces to deploy internally to ensure security. He put an additional 5400 police, gendarmes , and soldiers on the streets of Paris at strategic points, he says. In 2003, as a result of a dramatic loss of life during a heat wave, the government developed a new plan to respond to disasters. The plan ( Plan Canicule , "Heat Wave Plan") has four steps. The government maintains vigilance by having technological systems in place that may signal a potential disaster. For example, equipment for detection of radiation might be deployed in the event of a nuclear plant accident, or a radiological attack. The system remained at this level until December 31, 2003. Ministries concentrate available information in fewer hands. The prime minister decides that a body similar to a U.S. interagency group must be convened. The Gendarmerie might also be called upon to ensure public order and to assist in other ways, such as the movement of large numbers of people, supervision of traffic flow, and provision of transport. The fourth step is "requisition." In this step, the prime minister directs the prefects to take specific measures to prepare for a disaster. directs COGIC to use existing authority to seize all necessary transport (trains, planes, automobiles), and to direct the media to broadcast information to the population. The armed forces may be directed to engage in security operations. Through the prefects, the government can direct local officials, such as mayors, to provide needed information and resources. The government has installed radar near nuclear power installations to detect threats to the facilities. The special military unit is being prepared to aid in this effort. France has long placed air marshals on selected flights to counter an attempted hijacking. Under the Vigipirate system, security forces deploy at key sites, such as bridges and tunnels. When radioactive materials that may pose a threat to the population are transported, it is the Ministry of Economy and Finance that moves them. U.S. Customs inspectors have joined French counterparts in Le Havre and Marseille to examine sea cargo containers for the possible presence of weapons of mass destruction and illicit smuggling. France has a "biotox" plan to secure biological agents in laboratories. Since 2004, the government has carried out a number of large-scale exercises to test its response to a chemical or biological attack. The European Union plays an important role in the effort to counter terrorism in Europe. From the 1950s France has placed the EU at the center of its efforts to build a stable society and strong economy. Increasingly, France and other EU members have shared responsibility for counter-terrorism efforts. France and its EU partners maintain a common list of terrorists and terrorist organizations. One part of the list is directed against Al Qaeda and the Taliban. The EU has adopted U.N. Security Council sanctions against these groups. All EU members have agreed to freeze the assets of individuals and organizations on the list. In 2001 the EU agreed to eliminate extradition proceedings among member states for a range of crimes, including terrorism. EU members also agreed to strengthen EU police and judicial institutions. Since 1999, Europol has served elements of their sovereignty. France and other EU members are attempting to control illegal immigration. The effort has become enmeshed in a debate that sometimes links terrorism to illegal immigration from the Middle East. France tends to have several bilateral intelligence sharing arrangements that are stronger than any general policy of sharing among all member states. France is part of the Schengen plan, which allows EU citizens to cross borders of member states with minimal involvement with border officials. It has established joint border controls with Spain and Italy to capture and expel illegal immigrants. Strong central authority in France has traditionally meant that the government constrains civil liberties when there is a real or perceived threat. Under the Vigipirate system, the police frequently check individuals' identities and inspect carried items. While there is no requirement for a national identity card in France, it is difficult to undertake a range of casual activities, such as cashing a check, obtaining a loan, or applying for employment without one. At times of a high alert, police will stop and question people who appear to fit a description. French Interior Minister Nicholas Sarkozy has reacted strongly to the imams in France's Muslim population who have criticized France and other western countries. Sarkozy is also at the forefront of an effort in the French government to place restraints on immigration. He has said: Those who make excessive and violent remarks foreign to the values of our Republic will be expelled. The Republic is not a weak regime and does not have to accept speeches that, under the guise of being protected by being delivered in a place of worship, might call for hatred and murder. Only fragmentary information is available on French funding for homeland security. In 2002, parliament passed a bill that allocated $5.6 billion for the period 2003-2007 to hire 7,000 more gendarmes and 6,500 more police for localities. In 2003 the government allocated 52 million euros (approximately $65 million) through 2008 to programs to counter chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats. By one estimate, France spends approximately one percent of its GDP on public order and safety. The French governmental system is significantly different from the U.S. system. The mixture of a presidential and a parliamentary system may explain the difficulty. The president and the government that he appoints have very strong executive authority. Resources come, as needed, on an ad hoc basis, from a range of government ministries and agencies to respond to disasters or terrorist attacks. The parliament does pass a yearly budget, and sometimes budget programs for a series of years, but the government normally presents a general budget that parliament largely embraces. Germany has no department or ministry for "homeland security" The country's long established organization for protecting security and responding to emergencies within its borders is defined by the 1949 Basic Law. Since 9/11, the government has viewed terrorism as the most immediate threat to German national security. Germany does have decades of experience with domestic terrorism by the Red Army Faction (RAF), a German left-wing anarchist group that operated from the beginning of the 1970s to the late 1990s. It is therefore much easier in France than in the United States to move funding around to respond to domestic or foreign developments. At the federal level, ministries involved most directly in "homeland security" functions include Interior, Justice, Defense, and Foreign Affairs. The most important intelligence authorities in Germany are the Federal Intelligence Service (BND) and the Federal Bureau for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) Post-9/11, the BKA has the authority to lead its own investigations, replacing the former system which required a formal request from the BfV. German authorities have conducted computer-aided searches of the type that had proven successful in profiling and dismantling the Red Army Faction in the 1990s. German law enforcement and intelligence communities still face more bureaucratic hurdles, stricter constraints, and closer oversight than those in many other countries. Privacy rights of individuals and the protection of personal data are given prominent attention. Police are prohibited from collecting intelligence and can only begin an investigation when there is probable cause that a crime has been committed. Some experts believe that there may be little support for further centralizing Germany's "homeland security" efforts in the absence of an attack on German soil. The 16 federal states oppose further centralization at the federal level, not wanting to cede authority. The German structure for civil protection and emergency response has been in place since 1949. Responsibility for protecting the population in peacetime is assigned to the 16 states of the Federal Republic and their local jurisdictions. The primacy of the states was reemphasized in the 1997 Civil Defense Law. Each state has its own structures and laws for emergency planning and operations in peace time. The federal government provides the federal government with the primary responsibility in time of war or threat of war and even then implementation of federal orders is left largely to local authorities. After 9/11 and the disastrous floods in Germany in 2002, a new civil defense strategy was agreed. The new strategy called for a coordinated approach between the federal government and the states. A new Federal Office for Civil Protection and Disaster Response (BBK) was created in 2004, under the Ministry of Interior. Legal responsibility, however, was left with the states, under laws and regulations of most of the states; local authorities are responsible for crisis management in most cases. If a crisis is beyond a state's ability to cope or hits more than one state, the federal Ministry of the Interior is charged with coordinating. Germany's response to terrorism has been influenced by its experiences of the Nazi era. Germany has sought to protect rights and liberties of all those residing in Germany. Despite this focus on protection of civil liberties, the German government is determined to go after extremists. Germany's annual "Report on the Protection of the Constitution, 2004" estimated that about 32,000 German residents were members of some 24 Islamist organizations with extremist ties. The government banned and moved against twenty religious groups and conducted hundreds of raids. German authorities were given wider latitude in accessing financial data of terrorist groups. Steps were taken to curb international money laundering and improve bank customer screening procedures. Measures to prevent money laundering now include the checking of electronic databases to ensure that banks are properly screening their clients' business relationships. The Federal Criminal Police Office set up an independent unit responsible for the surveillance of suspicious financial flows. The German Federal Banking Supervisory Office, banks, financial service providers and others must monitor all financial flows for money laundering. In seeking to dry up the sources of terrorist financing, recent regulations aim to strengthen Germany's own capabilities. Germany has two borders to defend, its own and the EU's. Academic and job training programs may have allowed potential terrorists to obtain extended residency permits. Second generation immigrants may serve as a potential recruitment pool. Germany's approach to terrorism and homeland security is influenced by its geographic position in the heart of Europe and its membership in the European Union (EU) Germany has sought to shorten the period between passage of new EU anti-terror legislation and its coming into effect. The FATF has characterized Germany's anti-money laundering regulations as comprehensive and effective. Germany is pushing for wider use of biometric identifiers on passports, visas, and resident permits. Funding for "homeland security" functions is spread throughout the federal and state governments. There is not a spending category combining activities that would fall under the rubric of "Homeland security." The annual Budget Act is the vehicle through which budgets are set for federal government agencies and revenues are allocated between theFederal and state levels of government. The two chambers of the German parliament must pass the Budget Act and play a significant role. Italy does not have one government department responsible for all aspects of homeland security and counterterrorism. Each of the 16 states sets its own budget priorities and allocations to individual state ministries and agencies. Italy's inter-governmental approach to promoting domestic security has largely grown out of decades of first-hand experience, says the U.S. Embassy in Rome. The U.N. Security Council has called on Italy to increase its spending on domestic security and counter-terrorism in the wake of the attacks in Paris. The Red Brigades, an anarchist group, carried out numerous acts of violence in the 1970s and early 1980s against Italian political leaders, judges, and businessmen. Extremist Palestinian groups murdered U.S., European, and Israeli nationals in attacks on Italian airplanes and airports. Italy views prevention and strong law enforcement and intelligence efforts as key to ensuring domestic security, combating terrorism, and protecting the Italian public, infrastructure, and historical and cultural sites. Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, Italy stepped up efforts to disrupt terrorism. Italy is pursuing measures to promote Muslim integration to help prevent terrorist recruitment. The March 2004 terrorist attacks on commuter systems in Madrid, Spain, and the July 2005 bombings of London's metro and bus lines have galvanized further Italian action. As a member of the European Union (EU), Italy has also supported EU measures since September 11 to improve law enforcement and intelligence cooperation among its 25 member states. Italy is a major point of entry for illegal immigrants to Europe, also sought to tighten its immigration and border controls. Some right-wing Italian politicians claim that Italy is not doing enough to protect itself from the threat of international terrorism. They have pressed for an Italian "homeland security" ministry similar to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Many Italian officials, however, are cautious of the need to strike a balance between improving security measures and protecting personal freedoms. Various government leaders and ministries play a role in different aspects of Italian domestic security affairs and the fight against terrorism, writes Alessandro Girolamo. Italy's national budgeting system involves multiple ministries and departments. Italian spending on "public order and security" is roughly $34 billion per year. Italy's economy has been sluggish with little GDP growth and an unemployment rate of 7.5%. Italy is also under pressure from the EU to rein in its rising budget deficit to bring it back in line with EU rules governing the budget..enforcement bodies and the secret services. It appears to be similar to the U.S. National Counter Terrorism Center or the UK's Joint Intelligence Analysis Center. Italy has sought to enhance its law enforcement and intelligence tools against terrorism since September 11. Despite these financial difficulties, Italian officials insist that combating international terrorism is a top priority. Some experts suggest that Italy needs to improve further the coordination between and among its various law Enforcement and intelligence agencies. Italian officials have been considering establishing a national prosecuting office for terrorism offenses and a central terrorist suspect database, but disagreements appear to persist about its specific structure and functions. In addition, there is no central database of terrorist suspects, as there is for the Mafia, that would enable more efficient and comprehensive information-sharing. Critics question whether Italy is devoting sufficient resources to enhancing its intelligence capabilities. The September 11 attacks gave added momentum to Italy's efforts to tighten its border controls and clamp down on illegal immigration. Italy has not been shy about deporting radical imams and other Islamist extremists. Italian officials assert that maritime and rail security has been enhanced, especially following the July 2005 bombings of London's metro and bus lines. The Italian civil aviation authority was also granted roughly $3 million in additional funding to improve security at selected airports. Italy places emphasis on cooperation with other EU member states, both within and outside the EU framework. Italy participates in the EU's Schengen open border system, which allows EU citizens to cross into and out of Italy freely. Police presence has been increased on Italy's rail networks and around a number of sensitive railway stations and other rail transport systems, such as the Rome subway. Italy has advocated greater consular cooperation and information-sharing among EU members, and called on the EU to include repatriation agreements in its cooperation treaties with African countries. establish EU asylum centers outside EU territory to process refugee claims and to cut EU financial aid to countries of origin that fail to reduce the flow of illegal immigrants. Other EU member states remain opposed to such initiatives, however, viewing them as too draconian and counterproductive. Italy and France have established joint border controls to capture and expel illegal immigrants, and with Spain, are planning joint naval patrols in the Mediterranean to fight illegal immigration, drug-trafficking, and other criminal activity. Since September 11, Italy has further developed a national emergency plan to deal with the consequences of a possible CBRN incident. Italy has a network of 1,200 radiation monitoring stations across the country to facilitate the early detection of a radiological or nuclear event. CBRN training programs for firefighters, military personnel, and civilian medical personnel are long-standing. Italy has enhanced security around many sensitive targets, including government buildings, transport facilities, military barracks, public utilities, communication centers, and artistic and cultural sites. According to press reports, intelligence assessments view Rome and Milan as the most likely cities to fall victim to a terrorist attack. area, treating those contaminated, and evacuating adjoining areas. Spanish authorities later said that the Al-Qaeda-linked Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group was involved in the attacks. Many observers believe that the March 11 attacks helped determine the outcome of Spain's parliamentary election, held three days later. The Socialist Party won the election, although pre-election polls taken before the attack gave the then-ruling Popular Party a narrow majority. Prime Minister Zapatero has been careful to note that he does not see Islamist terrorism as a threat. Spain has rejected a wholesale reorganization of its homeland security institutions. This is due in large part to the decades-long struggle with the Basque terrorist movement Eta. Even before the 3/11 attacks, Spain had a substantial body of law and institutional capacity to fight terrorism, perhaps more than some European countries and the United States. Another factor conditioning Spain's approach to the issue of homeland security is that the Socialists, and many other Spaniards, are leery of a military solution. Unlike the United States, Spain has a highly centralized police structure. Civil liberty concerns have not been as prominent in Spain as they have been in the U.S. The National Police Corps is responsible for security in urban areas and handles national investigations. The more heavily armed paramilitary organization, the Civil Guard, is stationed in rural areas and along highways. The March 11 commission recommended that local police be given more training in counterterrorism, particularly involving Islamist groups. issues with Spain's homeland security have been debated in the context of the conflict with Eta. The Ministry of the Interior is also responsible for emergency preparedness and response in Spain. After the March 11 attacks, the Interior put together an anti-terrorism prevention and protection plan. Spain's foreign intelligence efforts are undertaken by the National Intelligence Center (CNI), which is subordinated directly to the Prime Minister's office. The CNI's personnel are overwhelmingly drawn from Spain's Ministry of Defense. The Defense Minister has prepared a rapid-response plan for CBRN threats. Over 250 soldiers are assigned to CBRN units in Valencia, Burgos, and Madrid. The 3/11 commission report bemoaned the lack of a true "intelligence community" in Spain. In response, the government has sharply increased resources for counterterrorism. In 2005, Spain spent 350 million Euros ($417 million) for counterterrorism efforts. The government budget for 2006 proposes a 5% increase to 368 million Euros (over $438 million) Spain has formed bilateral police investigative teams with France to fight terrorism, in part a legacy of the two countries' close cooperation in recent years in fighting Basque terrorist threat. Spain has pushed strongly for stronger law enforcement, intelligence, and border control cooperation within the European Union. The government has taken steps to disperse jihadists among Spanish prisons. Spain is also holding suspects related to the 9/11 attacks in the United States and in a planned attack on several government buildings and public landmarks in Madrid in October 2004. As of January 2006, over 200 men were imprisoned in Spain for offenses related to Islamist terrorism, according to the Spanish government. The United Kingdom does not have one department responsible for all aspects of homeland security and counterterrorism. UK policy toward terrorism and other security challenges is largely coordinated by inter-departmental committees of ministers and other government officials. September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States have focused greater UK attention on the threats posed by international terrorists. In April 2004, the British government unveiled a new comprehensive, cross-Departmental Counterterrorism Strategy (known as CONTEST) The "4Ps" seek to give greater coherence to UK counterterrorism measures and take advantage of existing expertise and resources throughout the UK government. The UK's emergency response system and capabilities were put to the test on July 7, 2005, when four young British Muslims attacked London's metro and bus lines. Despite the fatalities and the damage to the London metro system, many assess that the government and emergency services responded competently and effectively in the immediate aftermath of the crisis. As a result, the impact of the attacks on the daily life of the city and general population was marginal. The British government believes that its inter-governmental/committee approach to response to terrorist incidents can also be used in response to a terrorist incident. Some, including the opposition Conservative (Tory) party, have proposed creating a UK ministry equivalent to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. In February 2006, UK Chancellor of the Exchequer pledged to examine the case for a single security budget in the UK's upcoming 2007 spending review. Some view this statement as an indication of the government's new "open-mindedness" toward the possibility of forming a new Homeland Security ministry. The UK Cabinet is the supreme, collective decision-making body in the British government, chaired by the Prime Minister. committees and subcommittees. The Cabinet Secretariat largely manages the day-to-day business of the Cabinet committees. The Defense and Overseas Policy (DOP) ministerial committee and two of its subcommittee play key roles in forging long-term UK domestic security and counterterrorism policies. The Intelligence Services ministerial committee reviews policy on the security and intelligence services, including their counterterrorist efforts. In the event of an actual terrorist incident, a Cabinet-level emergency crisis management body—known as COBR (for the Cabinet Office briefing room in which it meets)—is convened. The Civil Contingencies Committee (CCC) is heavily involved in longer-term emergency preparedness and response. It coordinates and continually reviews the preparation of plans for ensuring the prompt and effective delivery of supplies and services during an emergency. CCS was originally set up in response to several crises in 2000 (including fuel protests, the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, and severe flooding), but was given new impetus after the September 11 attacks. In July 2001, the UK government established a new Civil Contedencies Secretariat (CCS) within the Cabinet Secretariat. In June 2002, Prime Minister Blair created a new Security and Intelligence Coordinator within the Cabinet Office. Some have likened the position to a "homeland security chief," or the White House's now defunct Office of Homeland Security. The Coordinator is directly responsible to the Prime Minister and is tasked with coordinating and developing, across all government departments, work on counterterrorism and crisis management. Some suggest that this new position was created to give greater coherence to UK security efforts and emergency response capabilities. As the principal accounting officer for the Single Intelligence Account, the Coordinator plays a key role in setting priorities and budgets. The Home Office is the focal point for the response to the terrorist threat. It is also responsible for domestic security policies, planning for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) incidents. HM Revenue and Customs has the lead responsibility for detecting prohibited and restricted goods at import and export, including those goods that may be used by terrorists. The Department for Transport's Transport Security and Contingencies Directorate is responsible for the security of the traveling public and transport facilities through regulation of the aviation, maritime, and railway industries. Policing in the UK is largely decentralized. The Home Office has ministerial responsibility for the police services in England and Wales. Each police force also has its own Special Branch, which works in partnership with the Security Service (MI5) The UK has three main intelligence and security services engaged in the fight against terrorism, including MI5, MI6, and GCHQ. The British Transport Police (BTP) police the railway systems of England, Wales, and Scotland. The Civil Nuclear Constabulary is an armed police force that protects civil nuclear installations and nuclear materials. GCHQ operate under the statutory authority of the Foreign Secretary. The Joint Intelligence Committee advises the government on priorities for intelligence gathering and for assessing its results. In June 2003, in an effort to improve intelligence-sharing and cooperation against terrorism, the UK created the Joint Intelligence Analysis Center (JTAC) to collate and evaluate intelligence about potential threats. JTAC seeks to break down institutional barriers between analysts of the different security and intelligence agencies by drawing together about threats and provide early warning. The JIC is currently chaired by Sir Richard Mottram, the Security and Intelligence Coordinator. 100 officials from 11 government departments and agencies, including MI5, MI6, GCHQ, the police, and the defense and transport ministries. JTAC provides both long-term studies of international terrorism and immediate assessments of current threats; it is analogous to the U.S. National Counter Terrorism Center. Although the police and security services have the primary role in domestic protection against terrorism, the armed forces may be called upon domestically in the event of a major terrorist incident. The decision to deploy the military to assist the civil authorities in an emergency would be made by COBR. The UK's parliamentary system influences government decisions regarding homeland security budgetary priorities. The Prime Minister and his Cabinet are drawn from the political party with a majority in the House of Commons. There is no strict separation of the executive and legislative branches of government in the UK. UK spending on "public order and security" grew from roughly $40 to roughly $50 billion in the last five years, according to a report by the Royal Institute of International Affairs (RII) The RII says the UK government's proposed budgetary levels are usually contested in the same way as they often are in the United States. British government announced in its 2004 Spending Review that total spending on counterterrorism and resilience across departments will be over $3.6 billion by 2007-2008. In the immediate aftermath of September 11, 2001, the British government provided supplemental funding to enable departments, such as the military, the police, and the intelligence services to meet the increased need for heightened security measures. Extra funding of about $543 million in 2006-2007 and $614 million in 2007- 2008 will also be devoted to counterterrorist measures. In light of the July 2005 London bombings, the Chancellor of the Exchequer in December 2005 announced that a further $149 million will be provided to the security and intelligence services to aid their efforts in the fight against terrorism. The Blair government has also placed increased emphasis on promoting Muslim integration and combating extremism. Many UK officials view such efforts not only as necessary to address societal divisions, but also as key prevention strategies in the long-term fight against terror. The UK government has introduced a raft of new legislation and pursued a variety of measures to combat terrorism and improve UK homeland security. Since September 11, British authorities have stepped up their law enforcement efforts against Al Qaeda and members of other radical groups. Hundreds of suspects have been questioned and arrested, and UK police and security services have increased their monitoring of mosques. UK authorities have disrupted several potential terrorist plots over the last few years, such as breaking up an Al Qaeda-affiliated cell in 2003 accused of producing ricin and other chemical weapons. However, the evidentiary bar for convictions in the UK remains set high given Britain's strong civil liberty traditions and democratic ideals. The increased funding for the security and intelligence agencies has been aimed largely at enhancing training and boosting recruitment. MI5 has begun a recruitment campaign to increase its size by 50% (to 3,000 staff) by 2008. Some observers question whether the UK is devoting sufficient resources to improving its intelligence capabilities. Others point out that even with expanded resources, GCHQ has been forced to reduce its collection activities in many non-priority geographical areas and even on some aspects of counterproliferation. The September 11 terrorist attacks gave added momentum to UK efforts to tighten its immigration and asylum procedures. The UK also has long-standing legislation and security programs focused on preventing acts of violence from being perpetrated against UK air, maritime, and rail transport systems. Some of these security measures, especially in the aviation sector, were instituted after the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988. Following the July 2005 London bombings, the UK government announced plans to: make it easier to deport or exclude foreign individuals from the UK who advocate violence. In 2002, the UK announced a program to train armed sky marshals for use on UK-registered aircraft. Press reports suggest that they are now operating on some transatlantic flights. New rules allow law enforcement agencies to request information about passengers and goods from air and sea carriers. New technology at the Channel Tunnel to check for people concealed in lorries or trains; introduction of equipment at all UK ports and airports to screen for illicit importations of radioactive materials. Several UK ports also participate in the U.S. Container Security Initiative, which stations customs officers in foreign ports. British government asserts that most UK ports, including all major and high risk ports, are in compliance with a new International Maritime Organization (IMO) code. IMO code requires international ships and port facilities to implement tighter security regimes, train staff, and draw up plans for responding to a terrorist threat. London expects that all remaining UK ports will soon be in compliance also. As for rail security, in the wake of the March 2004 bombings of commuter trains in Madrid, Spain, the British government initiated a review of counterterrorist security on the UK's railway network. UK will conduct trial screenings of passengers and baggage at a small number of national rail and London Underground stations during 2006. Some analysts point to a lack of personnel resources to ensure that all UK border control and security measures are properly implemented. Others note that the UK has been struggling to balance new transport security requirements with the costs to the transport industry and the traveling public. For instance, press reports suggest that the Home Office was forced to scale back its original plans to require air and sea carriers to obtain additional personal data from passengers. would be cost-prohibitive and inconvenience passengers given the extra processing time it would require. The British government has also put priority on countering the CBRN aspect of terrorism and improving the ability of emergency service providers to respond quickly and effectively to a CBRN incident. The UK has also devoted increased funding over the last several years to counter bio-terrorism and stockpile extra vaccines and antibiotics. Press reports indicate that MI5 has identified nuclear power stations, oil depots, and high-profile London buildings as priority terrorist targets. Home Office: improving ability of police, fire, and ambulance services to deal with terrorist attacks has been a top priority. In 2002, the UK established a cross-governmental Capabilities Program, coordinated by the Civil Contingencies Secretariat. The Program is divided into 17 different "workstreams," the focus of which ranges from maintaining essential services to dealing with CBRN incidents or infectious diseases. The CCS has also established a national risk assessment process to identify risks over a five-year period and form the basis for emergency preparedness. In 2004, the UK Parliament passed the Civil Contingencies Act. This act represented the first wholesale revision of UK emergency legislation since the 1920s. It was intended to set out clear expectations and responsibilities of first responders, local and regional authorities, and the central government. The act encountered some resistance from human rights and civil liberty groups concerned that its definition of an "emergency" was too broad and that it could lead to an unnecessary curtailment of freedoms. Although analysts assess that the UK has made significant progress in enhancing its emergency preparedness and response abilities, they also point out that some challenges remain.

Summary:
General revenue sharing (GRS) is typically defined as unconditional federal grants to state and local governments. GRS has not been explicitly identified as a primary tool to provide counter-cyclical assistance. Over the almost 15-year life of the GRS program (1972 through 1986), over $83 billion was transferred from the federal government. To achieve a comparable magnitude of assistance today, approximately $313 billion (in 2008 dollars) would need to be distributed over the next 15 years. Some observers have suggested that a revenue sharing program that provided states with grants to forestall spending cuts and tax increases in 2009 may deter pro-cyclicals. The relative income factor (RIF) and the general tax effort factor (GTEF) were intended to adjust the state allocations based on the state's "ability-to-pay" and tax structure. The GTEF was considered important for GRS because it created a disincentive for states to reduce taxes and rely more on the federal government for revenue over time. In the three-part GRS formula, the higher a state's RIF, the greater the share of revenue. The rationale behind GRS cannot be traced to a single political or economic objective. Proponents of reallocation cite the more "progressive," and thus desirable, structure of federal taxes. Opponents of federal assistance to state and local governments during economic slowdowns suggest that poor state-local fiscal management creates deficit problems. The arguments for and against GRS are subjective because they rely on measuring fairness. of GRS is a bipartisan effort to improve federal revenue sharing between the states and the federal government. First, layoffs reduce aggregate demand because when workers are laid off, their income would fall steeply until they find new jobs, causing their consumption to fall. Second, since government services are included in GDP, measured economic activity would be directly reduced as long as resources (workers) lay idle. If GRS prevented net job losses, these negative effects on the economy could be avoided. The saving behavior of potentially separated employees would likely enhance the stimulative effect of avoiding job losses. But avoiding induced early retirement may provide less stimulus. than avoiding furloughs and lay-offs. Research has shown that low income workers save a smaller portion of their income than high income workers. Across-the-board cuts would affect a variety of spending programs that do not easily conform to one succinct appraisal. The stimulative effect of avoiding cuts in local aid would be positive, though the magnitude is uncertain. Generally, tax cuts are more stimulative than cuts in state and local aid. It is likely that their incomes are lower than the median for state employees. If the employees are early in their careers and/or are in low skill positions, they are likely candidates for layoffs. cuts are less stimulative than direct spending increases, because individuals are likely to save some of their tax cut. Debt reduction and contributing to a rainy day fund would offer little stimulus because such action would be equivalent to an increase in public saving. In the short run, increased public saving does not stimulate the economy. If the federal grants were used to avoid tapping into tobacco revenue, the saving effect would be similar to contributing to an emergency fund. The combined effect of the various potential responses of state and local governments to federal grants is difficult to quantify a priori. GRS grants authorized by the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972 (the 1972 Act) were essentially unconditional. GRS grants could be used by local governments for the following acceptable operating expenditures. Congress believed GRS was necessary for a variety of reasons. The most prominent reason at the time was the perceived need for reallocation of government responsibilities arising from the changing citizen demands for government services. The congressional sentiment behind the 1972 Act that created general revenue sharing is summarized well in the following passage from the Senate report accompanying the Act. The need for public services has increased manyfold and their costs are soaring. At the same time, state and local governments are having considerable difficulty in raising the revenue necessary to meet these costs. The Nixon Administration seemed to have a similar perspective. When President Nixon signed the legislation, the President remarked that the GRS program would "place responsibility for local functions under local control and provide local governments with the authority and resources they need to serve their communities effectively" But the shift in the demand for and provision of government services was not the only justification for GRS. to alter the nation's overall tax system by placing greater reliance on income taxation (predominantly federal) as opposed to property and sales taxation. Counteracting cyclical economic problems, such as state and local budget deficits induced by a slowing economy, was not explicitly mentioned as justification for GRS in the 1972 Act. When the debate began in 1974 on extending GRS beyond 1976, the countercyclical potential of revenue sharing apparently became important to policymakers. The 1976 extension also eliminated the priority expenditure categories for local governments and the prohibition on states from using the grants for federal matching grants. The program would be funded at a rate of $10 million for each one-tenth percentage point decline in real wages and salaries measured from the pre-recession base. The amount of money allocated in any one quarter would be limited to $300 million. After setting aside 1% of the funds for Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands, the remaining funds would then be split evenly between state governments and "county areas" The state portion would be adjusted by the state's tax effort. The 1980 Act discontinued revenue sharing for the states. It introduced the concept of providing countercyclical fiscal assistance through federal grants to state and local governments. The 1980 Act provided $13.7 billion in grants to local governments—approximately 2.3% of total own-source revenue. Local governments generated $593.8 billion of own source revenue over the three fiscal years covered by the 1980 Act. The 1983 Extension provided the same amount for local governments in three equal annual installments of $4.567 billion. This amount was equal to the amount received by local governments from 1977 through 1980.

Summary:
Influenza pandemic continues to be a real and significant threat facing the United States and the world. It is unknown when an influenza pandemic will occur, where it will begin, or whether an H5N1 virus or another strain would be the cause. Influenza pandemics have spread worldwide within months, and a future future pandemic could be much worse. The U.N.’ World Health Organization has said that infectious diseases are spreading faster than at any time in history. An influenza pandemic is not a singular event, but is likely to come in waves, each lasting weeks or months. A pandemic will not directly damage physical infrastructure such as power lines or computer systems. It threatens the operation of critical systems by potentially removing the essential personnel needed to operate them from the workplace. In a severe pandemic, absences attributable to illnesses, the need to care for ill family members, and fear of infection may reach a projected 40 percent during the peak weeks of a community outbreak. An influenza pandemic could result in 200,000 to 2 million deaths in the United States, depending on its severity. In September 2008, the World Bank reported a 4.8 percent drop in world economic activity, which would cost the world economy more than $3 trillion. The Homeland Security Council (HSC) took an active approach to this potential disaster by issuing the National Pandemic Strategy in November 2005, and the National pandemic Implementation Plan in May 2006. HSC indicated in.absence during the weeks before and after the peak. In the event of a catastrophic disaster, the leadership roles, responsibilities, and lines of authority for the response at all levels must be clearly defined and effectively communicated. Most of these federal leadership roles involve shared responsibilities between HHS and DHS, and it is not clear how these would work in practice. The relationship of these roles to each other as well as with other leadership roles in a pandemic is unclear. Both USDA and DHS agreed that they should develop additional clarity and better define their coordination roles in these circumstances. Strong advance planning, both within and among federal, state, and local governments and other organizations, are essential to best position the nation to prepare for, respond to, and recover from an influenza pandemic. Capabilities are built upon the appropriate combination of people, skills, processes, and assets. Ensuring that needed capabilities are available requires effective planning and coordination as well as training and exercises. According to a UNSIC global survey, 141 countries, or 97 percent of those that responded, have pandemic preparedness plans. CDC: All 50 states and the 3 localities that received federal pandemic funds have developed influenza pandemic plans and conducted pandemic exercises. HHS-led interagency assessment of states’ plans found on average that states had “many major gaps” in their plans in 16 of 22 priority areas, such as school closure policies. The remaining 6 priority areas were rated as having “a few major gaps.” HHS and DHS generally concurred with our recommendation, but have not yet held these additional meetings. Health care systems would need the ability to adequately care for a large number of patients or patients with unusual or highly specialized medical needs. The ability of local or regional health care systems to deliver services consistent with established standards of care could be compromised, at least in the short term. The volume of patients would far exceed the available hospital beds, medical personnel, pharmaceuticals, equipment, and supplies. Providing such care would require the allocation of scarce resources. In contrast to discrete events such as hurricanes and most terrorist attacks, the widespread and iterative nature of a pandemic presents challenges. management approaches that have been used in the past to increase capacity when responding to other types of disasters. In a severe influenza pandemic, almost 10 million people would require hospitalization, which would exceed the current capacity of U.S. hospitals. States would likely be unwilling to share scarce resources or deploy personnel into a location where the disease is active and thus expose those individuals to a high-risk environment. NGA reported in its September 2008 issue brief on state pandemic preparedness that EMAC is seen as unreliable during a pandemic. existing shortages of health care providers, and the potential high absentee rate of providers. Given the uncertain effectiveness of efforts to increase surge capacity, HHS has developed guidance to assist health care facilities in planning for altered standards of care. The federal government has provided funding, guidance, and other assistance to help states prepare for medical surge in a mass casualty event, such as an influenza pandemic. We recommended that HHS serve as a clearinghouse for sharing among the states altered Standards of care guidelines developed by individual states or medical experts. HHS seeks to ensure availability of antiviral treatment courses for at least 25 percent of the U.S. population. As of May 2008, both HHS and states had stockpiled a total of 72 million treatment courses. HHS is encouraging expansion and refurbishing of existing facilities but also funding the development of new adjuvants, substances that can be added to influenza vaccines to reduce the amount of active ingredient needed. By using adjuvant and cell-based vaccines, manufacturers could produce more doses and smaller stockpiles could be used to protect a larger population. necessary materials acquired. The delayed use of antivirals and the emergence of antiviral resistance in influenza strains could limit their effectiveness. weaknesses within the international influenza surveillance system impede the detection of strains. In light of this anticipated limitation in supply, HHS released guidance on prioritizing target groups for a pandemic vaccine. USDA has coordinated with DHS and other federal agencies to create a National Veterinary Stockpile. It is intended to be the nation’s repository of animal vaccines, personal protective equipment and other critical veterinary products. In 2005, CDC designated establishing appropriate and effective information-sharing mechanisms to improve homeland security as a high-risk area. Citizens should be given an accurate portrayal of risk, without overstating the threat or providing false assurances of security, CDC says. Improving risk communication to the public was one of the top three challenges identified by the forum participants, the agency says. During the 2004-2005 flu season, demand for the flu vaccine exceeded supply, and information about future vaccine availability was uncertain. different audiences, and the importance of disseminating clear, updated information when responding to changing circumstances. The National Pandemic Implementation Plan emphasizes that government and public health officials must communicate clearly and continuously with the public throughout a pandemic. HHS (including CDC), DHS, and other federal agencies have provided a variety of influenza pandemic information and guidance for states and local communities. There are established coordination networks that are being used to provide information to state and local governments and to the private sector about pandemic planning and preparedness. For example, the FEBs are charged with providing timely and relevant information to support emergency preparedness and response coordination. FEB representatives generally viewed the boards as an important communications link between Washington and the field and among field agencies. Each of the selected boards we reviewed reported conducting communications activities as a key part of its emergency support service. In addition, critical infrastructure coordinating councils have been also primarily used as a means to share information and develop pandemic- specific guidance across the industry sectors, such as banking and finance. and telecommunications, and across levels of government. State and local officials from all of the states and localities we interviewed wanted additional federal influenza pandemic guidance. Although the federal government has issued some guidance, it may not have reached state andLocal officials. In addition, private sector officials have told us that they would like clarification about the respective roles and responsibilities of the federal and state governments during an pandemic emergency, such as in state border closures and pandemic vaccine distribution. In August 2007 we reported that although the National Pandemic Strategy and Implementation Plan identified the overarching goals and objectives for pandemic planning, the plan did not address state and local concerns. the documents had some gaps. Most of the implementation plan’s performance measures consist of actions to be completed, such as disseminating guidance. This lack of clear linkages makes it difficult to ascertain whether progress has in fact been made toward achieving the national goals and objectives. The National Pandemic Implementation Plan does not establish priorities among its 324 action items, which becomes especially important as agencies and other agencies join the effort to tackle the pandemic. The plan also does not provide a clear linkage to anticipated results, making it hard to gauge whether the purpose of the activity is achieved. Some action items, particularly those that are to be completed by state, local, and tribal governments or the private sector, do not identify an entity responsible for carrying out the action. The plan gives no indication of how these actions will be monitored, how their completion will be ensured, or who will be responsible for making sure that these actions are completed. Also, it appears that HSC’s determination of completeness has not been accurately applied for all of the action items. This is further complicated by the lack of a description of the financial resources needed to implement the actions. items. Several of the action items that were reported by the HSC as being completed were still in progress. Without clear departmentwide goals, it would be difficult for all DOD components to develop effective plans and guidance. DOD designated an official to lead DOD’s pandemic efforts, established a Pandemic Influenza Task Force, and communicated this information throughout the department. DOD also assigned responsibility to the U.S. Northern Command for directing, planning, and synchronizing DOD's global response to an influenza pandemic. HHS received $5.62 billion in supplemental appropriations specifically available for pandemic influenza- related purposes in fiscal year 2006. Of the $770 million, $600 million was specifically provided by Congress for state and local planning and exercising. Strengthening preparedness for large-scale public health emergencies is one of the issues that we identified as among those needing the urgent attention of the new administration and Congress during this transition period. Although much has been done, many challenges remain, as is evidenced by the fact that almost half of the recommendations that we have made over the past 3 years have not been implemented. have still not been fully implemented. Given the change in administration and the associated transition of senior federal officials, it will be essential for this administration to continue to exercise and test the shared leadership roles that have been established. DHS and HHS should also, in coordination with other federal agencies, continue to work with states and local governments to help them address identified gaps. These challenges include clarifying roles and responsibilities of federal and state governments. The challenges include coordinating between the federal and private sectors before and during a pandemic.  Continued leadership focus on pandemic preparedness is particularly crucial now as attention on influenza pandemic may be waning. U.S. should continue to work with international organizations and other countries to help address gaps in available information. The Secretary of Health and Human Services should expeditiously finalize guidance to assist state and local jurisdictions to determine how to effectively use limited supplies of antivirals and pre-pandemic vaccine in a pandemic. In December 2008, HHS released final guidance on antiviral drug use during an influenza Pandemic. Human Services and Homeland Security should convene additional meetings of the states in the five federal influenza pandemic regions to help them address identified gaps in their planning. HHS and DHS officials indicated that while no additional meetings are planned at this time, states will have to continuously update their pandemic plans and submit them for review. DHS officials informed us that the department is working on initiatives, such as developing pandemic contingency plan guidance tailored to each of the critical infrastructure sectors, and holding a series of “webinars” with a number of the sectors. GAO: USDA and Homeland Security should develop memorandum of understanding. Agencies should test effectiveness of this coordination during exercises, GAO says. HSC did not comment on the recommendation and has not indicated if it plans to implement it. GAO: Secretary of Agriculture should focus additional work with states on how to overcome potential problems associated with backyard birds and disposing of carcasses and materials. (4) USDA officials have told us that the agency has developed online tools to help states make effective decisions about carcass disposal. The National Veterinary Stockpile now contains enough antiviral medication to protect 3,000 animal health responders for 40 days. USDA has yet to determine the number of individuals that would need medicine based on a calculation of those exposed to the virus under a specific scenario. The Secretary of Agriculture should also determine how to obtain and provide supplies within 24 hours of an outbreak. (1) Appendix II: Implemented Recommendations from GAO’s Work on an Influenza Pandemic as of February 2009. The 14 national implementation plan tasks assigned to the Joint Staff as the lead organization within DOD have been completed. DOD, through U.S. Northern Command as the global synchronizer for pandemic influenza planning, collected information from the combatant commands on funding requirements. The combatant Commands are increasingly inviting representatives from the United Nations, including the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization; host and neighboring nations; and other federal government agencies to exercises and conferences to share information and fill information gaps. The Secretary of Defense should instruct the Joint staff to develop options to mitigate the effects of factors that are beyond thecombatant commands’ control. DOD views updating and reviewing plans to ensure that they are current as a continuous process driven by changes in policy, science, and environmental factors. The Chairman, Federal Reserve, the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Chairman, Securities and Exchange Commission should consider taking additional actions to ensure market participants adequately prepare for an outbreak. OPM should initiate discussion with the Department of Homeland Security and other responsible stakeholders to consider the feasibility of integrating the two plans. The U.S. Pacific Command, along with the military services and installations, are increasingly working and planning with state, local, and tribal representatives. the federal executive board’s (FEB) emergency support responsibilities into the established emergency response framework, such as the National Response Plan. The FEB strategic plan for fiscal years 2008 through 2012 includes operational goals with associated measures for its emergency preparedness, security, and employee safety line of business. OPM, as part of its strategic planning process for the FEBs, should develop a proposal for an alternative to the current voluntary contribution mechanism that would address the uncertainty of funding sources for the boards. U.S. Northern Command was designated as the lead combatant command for directing, planning, and synchronizing DOD’s global response to an influenza pandemic. DOD has updated its publicly available pandemic influenza Web site, to include links to the Military Vaccine Agency, which provides information on the risks and side effects of vaccines. DOD issued additional guidance related to the distribution of its vaccine and antiviral stockpiles in the event of an influenza Pandemic. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is utilizing established protocols for programming funds related to pandemic pandemic preparedness for DOD.
