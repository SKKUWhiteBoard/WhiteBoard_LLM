The U.S. Supreme Court is the highest federal court in the United States. The job is for life, barring resignation, retirement, or removal from the court by impeachment. So far, six justices have been foreign-born, at least one never graduated from high school, and another was only 32 years old when he joined the bench. Most presidents nominate individuals who broadly share their ideological view, so a president with a liberal ideology will tend to appoint liberals to the court. Of the 112 justices who have held the position, not one has yet been removed from office.
