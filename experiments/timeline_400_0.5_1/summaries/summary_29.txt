s gawan and the Green Knight um I believe this is the last piece where we don't know who the author is where it's unknown um I find the background interesting and that through textual Clues they're able to figure out who wrote it. I think straight off we can say that that's probably gow or sir GA however you want to say it okay then you have the villain or the dams and all as we come through the story try to put these titles with certain characters.
