Ka-Yen: I'm TA number three, that's what I call myself. I'll be teaching your lesson today because, well, Mike's in Russia. So this lesson won't be about nuclear energy. Because you guys just had a super intense exam, we just want to give you guys a break. OK, so we won't talk about it. So today, I'll been teaching you a little bit about nuclear power. So, yeah. Yeah, so I know you guys had your first exam a couple of days ago. How did that go? OK, sounds good. be super in-depth. There won't be a lot of crazy intense math because we just want to give you guys a break. You guys are going to be starting up full cycle on Friday with really cool topics like stopping power. A couple guys might already know some of the concepts that I'm mentioning. But I walked into MIT not knowing a single thing about nuclear energy. I was like, I wish someone could have told me these things. So that's what I want to do for you today, OK? between 1895 to 1945, that's really cool people were developing nuclear science. So people like Madam Curie or like Fermi, et cetera. They were all designing this nuclear science, like they were developing it, which is pretty cool. Most of this development happened between 1939 and 1945. They've entered a phase of like, well, the war is over. Now what do we do with ourselves? So luckily we decided to redirect this science into using it for energy. In 1951, the first nuclear reactor to produce electricity was the experimental breeder reactor, the EDR1. In 1953, President Eisenhower, he created something called atoms for peace. The first nuclear powered submarine, the USS Nautilus, was launched in 1954. The real heyday of nuclear was between 1960 to 1975, when there was a huge commercial energy boom. Today, China, India, and South Korea, they are the main players in this game. The main players are still, you would imagine, coal. Nuclear creates 75 times less carbon emission than coal does, and 35 times less than natural gas does. So that's the main reason why we're going for nuclear. But there's other kinds of really good reasons. One is the amounts of power output. You guys actually calculated this yourself in pset 1. You know just how much power or energy comes out from one fission reaction. So just so you guys can double check that you got that statistic right in your pset. it turns out that you get 3.5 million times more energy than burning one kilogram of coal does. You can see that you definitely need a lot less fuel in a nuclear reactor than you do in a normal coal burning reactor. And then finally, the last thing would be energy security. So one of the good things about nuclear is that it can serve as a good baseload source of energy. So nuclear power is a good option for energy security in the UK, especially in times of crisis. able to provide a good baseload source. That means it can provide conserve energy at a really high level all the time. So this is why we kind of want to replace coal and natural gas with nuclear, because it can take this role. Other alternative forms of energy might be better for the environment, it might be safer, and things like that, but it's not really able to do this. So for example, if you wanted to replace all the coal burning fire plants with solar panels, if it was not sunny that day, you're kind of out of luck. About what I've mentioned? Awesome. So now we'll talk a little bit about reactor types. I'll just tell you guys about some of the main ones and how they work. How people like to divide up the reactor types is in generations. So boiling water reactors, or BWRs, comprise about 21% of the reactors that are located and working in the United States. PWRs are actually more important, if you will, than B WRs. But they are functionally essentially the same, and it's just slightly more complicated. the fuel core. So the fuel core is basically just a bunch of rods of uranium, sometimes it's clad in something like zirconium, and there's also control rods to help slow down the process. So uranium undergoes what? AUDIENCE: Fission. TA: Yes, fission. So what gets released during fission?AUDIENCE: Heat. TA. And? AUDience: Neutrons, awesome. So those three things are all flying around inside the reactor core at the moment. The heat obviously goes to create power. a second. But the neutrons come flying around. So those other neutrons can simulate other fissions, and the control rods are there to make sure that there's not too many fissions happening in the fuel core at a certain time. So this is just one loop of water, basically. So the water flows through the core and heats it up. It creates steam so the steam goes and spins a turbine. The turbine creates electricity. And it comes back and gets recondensed. That's literally it. The chances of leaking nuclear material into the environment exists. With BWRs there is a higher chance of leaking radioactive material. So that's one of the downsides of B WRs. Do you have a favorite nuclear power plant? Share your photos and videos with CNN iReport.

But this time this water is pressurized. So does anyone know why you would want to pressurize the water? Yeah? AUDIENCE: So it doesn't boil? TA: Yeah, exactly. So when you increase the pressure, you're also increasing the boiling point of the water. That allows you to function at even higher temperatures than if you're working with a BWR, which gives you more energy efficiency. the higher efficiency. But also the chance of leaking nuclear material into the violent becomes mitigated. Because you have two separate loops with the nuclear fuel being more isolated from the environment, if there is a breach between the condenser loop and the secondary loop, not a big deal. Nothing really bad happens. You'd have to have breaches in both the loops, which is very unlikely to happen. Yeah? AUDIENCE: What's the standard like operating temperature of these kinds of reactors? TA: I'm not completely sure, but if you Google it you should be able to find it very easily. OK. here is basically just showing that there are a lot of redundancy systems inside these reactors. We don't just have one single primary loop and if it fails, it fails. We actually have four at the same time, and this is just called the n minus two redundancy, something like that. So the next kind is something much cooler. It's got a heavy water reactor. Actually it's just a little bit cooler. But the main heavy water reactors that everyone can kind of think of on their minds is CANDU, which is the one that's located in Canada. Heavy water has a much lower absorption cross-section than light water does. This means that when neutrons are flying around in the reactor there is a chance of it hitting a fission product and undergoing fission. But there's also a chance that the water that surrounds it will absorb that neutron. So if that neutron gets pulled out of the system you're not able to create any more fissions. This is actually kind of a bad thing because the whole point of nuclear reactors is to create heat and fission, so we don't want it. those neutrons to be absorbed. Because it's absorbing less-- because it has a chance of absorbing less neutrons as it undergoes its processes, you're actually able to use a lower enriched uranium. But the main downside is that, even though you're lowering your fuel costs, deuterium is really expensive. It's about 1,000 or so dollars per kilogram, which is kind of ridiculous because a kilogram of water is really not much at all, you know? So even though you're counteracting the lower fuel costs with higher water cost. Also, because you're using your reactor with lower enriched uranium, you actually have to change out your fuel more often. That fuel gets spent more quickly and I'll describe that in just a second, and therefore you just have to keep replacing it more often than you would for a normal light water reactor. Oh, I forgot to mention, but aside from that, everything else with the heavy water reactors and the PWRs, they're the same mechanisms. mentioned you guys before. But instead, now there's two little chunks of extra material. So do you guys know what the difference is between fissile, fertile, and fissionable material is? Cool. All right, so all right, let's start with fissiles material. Fissile material is basically just the material that is willing to undergo fission with a thermal neutron. So basically when the thermal neutron gets absorbed by this fissable material, it's going to undergo a fission. Makes a lot of sense, right? plutonium 239. There's four in total, but those are the two most important ones. So this is the main fuel that is inside a nuclear reactor, but it's not all just U235. So an example of fissionable material that's inside the other reactors at the same time is U238. If a U238 absorbs a thermal neutron, it is not going to do much. But if it absorbs a neutron of about like, I would say, like 2 meV, then it's more willing to undergo fission. U238 absorbs a neutron, becomes U239, undergoes a beta decay to come neptunium. U238 then undergoes one more Beta decay to become the beautiful plutonium 239. If we start with thorium 232 instead, becomes thorium 233. This is another fissile material by the way, through a series of beta decays. So that's what breeder reactors are doing. They're adding extra chunks of uranium 238 andextra chunks of thorium232 into the reactor. In the 60s we discovered that we have a lot more uranium ore than we thought we did. And after that discovery, people were not nearly as interested in breeder reactors. The reason being is that there's just this extra material that's hanging out. This extra material could be more fissile material that creates more reactions. It's also slightly more expensive because you're not being able to be power efficient. And it also is better on paper than it ever is in reality. keep adding more fissile materials, because it's not as perfect as they want it to be. And then finally we're going to move on to generation four reactors. Generation four reactors are all the new kind of reactors that people want to build. Here are the six kinds of generation four reactor types that were deemed to be the most promising. So there's gas-cooled fast reactors, lead- cooling reactors, molten salt reactors, sodium-cooling reactors, among others. fast reactors, very high temperature gas reactors, and supercritical water-cooled reactors. "I don't know all that much about these and I don't want to like spew out information that might potentially be false," he says. "A lot of people in Mike's group are working on molten salt reactors so you guys can go ahead and ask them about that" "Hopefully he will post the slides online and you guys just click it and there's a awesome source all about these different kinds of reactors" The main reason why we're a little bit hesitant to start using more nuclear power is because of safety issues. None of us can argue that nuclear is like 100% safe. It actually does have some dangers associated with it, which is why it's so important that we're doing what we'redoing. But if you guys look at this chart that I showed you guys in like the first or second slide, you'll notice that there are these events listed above. What are these words? Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, Fukushima, what are they? These accidents. like you probably know that they exist, but like what happened during them? So if you do know, sorry, but if you don't know, you're about to know. So Three Mile Island, which is the first one, it happened in 1979 on March 28. So the core melted down, the reactor wasn't able to operate anymore. The next reactor accident that we were alive for, which was cool, was Fukushima Daiichi. So these reactors, I think these are pressurized water reactors. A valve in a nuclear reactor became stuck. The valve was open and water was leaking out of the primary loop. When the water leaked, the pressure dropped and the reactor shut off coolant pumps. The reactor continued to operate again but the valve was still open and there was still water leaking out. It became stuck and they didn't realize that it became stuck because their equipment and their instrumentation wasn't able to detect that. So they shut the valve down and the pressure was released. But the valve remained open. of 1 milligram more dose than usual. So to put that in perspective, an x-ray is six milligrams. The next reactor accident, the big kahuna I like to call it, is Chernobyl. So on April 25, 1986 an RMBK reactor that was located in Ukraine exploded. So what they were doing at Chernobyl during the time of this explosion is that they're actually running, ironically enough, safety tests. They were running the reactor at low power to see how it behaves. quite realized this, but the coolant pumps in the reactor were also powered by the nuclear reactor being generated. So that was unfortunate, and they realized that this is a bad thing. So the reactor starts to go supercritical. So when they realize that the reactor was creating a lot more fissions than it should have been creating, they decide to insert the control rods. So thank goodness we have these high absorption control rods to slow things down, right? For some reason, I'm not completely sure why they did this. that caused the first explosion. Then, for some reason like a couple of minutes later, there's a second explosion. They're not completely sure why the second explosion happened. It could have been like building up helium or just a ton of other fission reactions. There was a lot of radioactive isotopes being spread into the environment. So that kind of stunk, but it did stop the whole reaction. Because a super critical mass was all blown apart, it was no longer super critical. It was fine. 28 highly exposed reactor staff and emergency workers die from this radiation or from thermal burns during this time. Officials also believe that there is about 7,000 cases of thyroid cancer that occurred because of Chernobyl. They're pretty sure it was Chernobyl because these are all cases that happened in people who are less than 18 years old. No one really lives near Chernobyl at the moment. It's kind of been deemed unlivable because these radioactive isotopes literally went everywhere in this environment and it's not safe to live there. we see that there are animals coming back now now. If you look on NationalGeographic.com there's like little deer roaming around Chernobyl. But it's been about-- how long has it been, like 30, 40 years? People aren't advised to live here still. So Chernobyl was terrible. Questions? Yeah? Audience: What does it mean for a reactor to go supercritical? TA: Oh, yeah, sorry. When I say supercritical it just means that there's way too many fission reactions happening. The reactors at Fukushima Daiichi began to explode. There was radioactive isotopes being spread out all around the country. No one was directly hurt by burns or radioactive exposure. Reactor accidents are actually pretty rare. If you think about it, it's been over 100 years since the first nuclear reactor was built in the United States. It's been a long time since there's been an accident at a nuclear power plant in the U.S. since the mid-20th century. That's the last time there was a nuclear accident. The main way of disposing of the spent fuel is putting it into spent fuel pools. This is an OK solution, except for the fact that we just have way too much spent fuel to be able to do this. Dry cask storage is a way to keep this spent fuel surrounded by an inert gas. repurposing is one other way of dealing with nuclear waste, which I think is the coolest option out of the bunch. is CNN Tech's weekly, offbeat look at what's happening in the world of nuclear power. Yucca Mountain is the primary push by the U.S. to find a deep geological repository somewhere in the United States so we can deal with our spent fuel. A lot of you guys chuckled when you saw Yucca Mountain. So in 2002 the main push for this began. They spent a lot of time and money on this project. It's been a long time coming, but it's finally coming to fruition. It will be located in the state of Nevada. It would be the first nuclear waste repository in the world. of money. They spent like billions of dollars finding the perfect location to put our spent fuel. People in Nevada weren't happy about this. They're like, why are we getting tossed on nuclear waste? We don't even have nuclear reactors in Nevada. There was a lot of opposition. And because of the social opposition there was government opposition and many loopholes we had to jump through, and so it was just becoming a huge disaster. They also realized that it wasn't as geologically sound as they had hoped. more groundwater running through and seeping through Yucca Mountain than they thought there would be, so it's actually not as safe as they had hoped. So there's a huge debacle. Basically the costs are rising, nothing much was happening. And then 2011, under the Obama Administration, he just called it quits. There's no more government funding toYucca Mountain. It's been abandoned, as you can see from this lovely Google picture. And you can also see that like 14 people went out of their way to review Yucca mountain. But we're actually doing OK. other forms of electricity. People buy the electricity that's cheapest, not necessarily the Electricity that's best for our grandchildren or something like that. Yeah, so that's why nuclear power isn't more of a thing, and that ends my pretty lengthy slide show. So do you guys have any questions about anything I mentioned? If you guys are interested about any of these topics, I recommend going to NRC.gov. They have a lot of really cool information. That's basically where I got the majority of my information for the slide show, and it is a reliable source. NRC.gov with less grains of salt than usual. Or if one of these things really piqued your interest, you guys can take 22.04, which is really cool class that's offered here I think this spring, and if not next spring. But basically it's called nuclear power society. It's taught by a guy named Scott Kemp. He talks about all these things and in a lot of detail and slower. So yeah, cool. So thank you guys so much for coming. I know you guys could have slept an extra hour.
