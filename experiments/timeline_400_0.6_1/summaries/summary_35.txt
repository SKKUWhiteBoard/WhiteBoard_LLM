In this video, we're going to compute some useful quantities for the exponential random variable. The CDF of x is the probability that X is less than or equal to little x. We use the standard formula, which is minus infinity to infinity t times fx of t dt. For this, if you evaluate the balance, 0 makes this 0, and 0 to get 1 over. And so the expectation is 1 over lambda, and so the variance is part c, so OK, so far so good.
