Professor: Can you explain the physical significance of the crystal momentum? Professor: The information about the momentum can be encoded in these spatial variation of the phase of the wave function. Professor: A central property from the Schrodinger equation is at the time variation d dt of p is equal to the expectation value of minus d the potential of x d x. The momentum expectation value is time independent, so it can be written in the form of e cubed, equal to e to the minus i upon h bar p l. give you one quick observation and then move on to the punchline of today. We've talked about identical particles before. And we've talkedabout identical particles in funny states. So for example, imagine I have two particles described by a wave function where the first particle could be in the state a and the second particles in theState b. And I can build aWave function for the first particles being in state a. And this tells us something totally awesome. But if I've taken these particles, put them in this entangled state, and sent one particle off to a distant planet, the second particle to my sister in DC, this should be yet another moment of serious discomfort. Einstein moved to Princeton in 1933. He left Germany in 1932 December, about three weeks before Hitler took power. He created a thought experiment which we're going to study in detail next week called the EPR experiment. And I want to share with you a really lovely description of the way the problem was represented in a way by-- this is from a book that I recommend to all of you. It's actually really hard to find. I was going to read you his actual quote. Now I'm just going to paraphrase it.
