Atas model shows what happens if aggregate demand increases and firms respond to this by saying we want to make more output. As people demand these higher wages shortening our supply curve decreases basically all the way back to essentially where it was before. The price of tuition to Missouri State goes down but my wage is fixed under contract right and so they're gonna have to pay me the Saints of tuition declines and my input prices stay the same that's bad for them and bad for all of the firm's too. it's gonna be trust me I've been doing this for 20 years questions on the AAAS wanna yes so that's what we're going to talk about when we talk about fiscal policy and monetary policy. Changes in taxes and changes in government spending are also pretty obvious right if your taxes go up and the government doesn't give you more goods and services for that you have less stuff similarly if taxes go down you have more money in your pocket right so you can change people's wealth by changing their taxes or by changing the services that they're getting in exchange. Keynesian model has problems too it doesn't work perfectly either so that's why we have these changes in aggregate demand. We'll get to that when we look at fiscal and monetary policy okay so I will see you guys on Wednesday we only have the exam. We only had the exam we only has the exam so we will be back on Wednesday to talk about fiscal and Monetary Policy. We will be talking about the impact of the stimulus package on the U.S. economy and the global economy.
