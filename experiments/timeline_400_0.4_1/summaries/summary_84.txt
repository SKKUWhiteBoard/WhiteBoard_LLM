Prof. Clark: Middle class was a form of self-identity that was constructed in the way being a worker was constructed, or being a noble. When you see Daumier or you see Delacroix's famous, Liberty Leading the People, and you see the bourgeois, there with his top hat, he's dressed in a bourgeois uniform like this. That emerges out of the bourgeois century. The middle classes started dressing like this in the nineteenth century, dark with a little bit of color. Once we've got an increase in the wealth of the middle classes, then you wanted the political power.
