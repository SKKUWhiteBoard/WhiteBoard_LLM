Thiazide tells us that this medication works in the early part of the distal convoluted tubule that's found within this nephron. This transporter is called the sodium chloride co-transporter and it is considered a cyanide sensitive transporter so hence why this drug works so well. While loop diuretics are a lot more effective than a thiazide diuretic but the thiazid does provide a nice diuresis effect. They're less effective in patients who have a compromised GFR a go merrill ER filtration rate. the high uric acid level and hyperglycemia again teach your diabetic patients to monitor their blood glucose really closely while taking a thigh. orthostatic hypotension this is where the when the patients maybe they've been sitting or lying down they get up they can fall they become dizzy you want to teach them to change position slowly. how do their lungs sound is their blood pressure coming down maybe they're getting this drug for hypertension how is their weights are they gaining weight or losing weight so we play a huge role with that as well okay so that wraps up this review over thighs I diuretics.
