Most Navy ships procured since the late 1950s have been funded in accordance with the full funding policy. Congress's decision on ship funding approaches could also affect future Navy capabilities, annual Navy funding requirements, and the shipbuilding industrial base. The issue can be alternately expressed as how to procure Navy ships economically while maintaining key congressional prerogatives. Full funding increases the opportunity to use performance-based fixed price contracts, allows for more efficient use of the work planning and investment, and increases the accountability for the achievement of the goals.
