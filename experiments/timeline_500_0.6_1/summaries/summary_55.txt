HONG LIU: So if you want to compute, say, some scattering amplitude from alpha to beta-- so alpha's some initial state and beta's some final state. Say alpha consists of momentum p1 and PN-- or pm, and beta, say momentum p m plus 1 and pn. And then you can get this scattering amplitude just by taking your momentum-space correlation function, OK, for the n points. So this is obtained by doing a Fourier transform. So any questions on this? Yes? AUDIENCE: So can you explain again why this diagram, like, you have one branch and then there's a loop? Klein-Gordon equation, if you interpret it as a wave equation, suffers some-- suffers from some difficulties. So Dirac proceeded trying to correct those difficulties, to overcome those difficulties. It turns out that the Dirac equation solved the first problem, OK, but didn't really solve the second problem. So nowadays, we interpret this this is the-- gives the field theory for-- OK, so of course, Dirac didn't know this, so essentially, he discovered this beautiful theory for the wrong motivation.  Dirac's idea of a Lorentz covariant equation was a "stroke of genius," he says. He says it would have to have a relativistic wave as its solution, and at least the wave should have a type of solution. But Dirac says it could also have a Hermitian solution, which would make it more general. Dirac: "There was nothing like this before. Just even from a mathematical point of view, it's purely, purely imaginative, OK?" frame, partial prime square-- OK, so this means in the prime coordinates-- minus m square and phi prime evaluated at the x prime, there must be a Lorentz frame. OK, trivially, you could do that just by definitions. So now we want to show that the Dirac equation has the same property, OK, and that is much more nontrivial. Again, it's really ingenious, ingenious, yeah, but we see, actually, it works.
