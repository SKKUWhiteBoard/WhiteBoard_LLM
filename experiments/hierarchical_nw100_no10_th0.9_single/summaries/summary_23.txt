Mining left behind legacy of abandoned mines, structures, safety hazards, and contaminated land and water. Many parties responsible for hardrock mining sites have been liquidated through bankruptcy or otherwise dissolved. EPA administers the Superfund program to address the health threats posed by contaminated waste sites. EPA also requires that parties statutorily responsible for cleaning up contaminated sites bear the cost of cleaning up the contaminated sites, including abandoned hardrock mine sites. Some 63 hardrock sites were on the National Priorities List and another 93 had the potential to be added.
