CASEY RODRIGUEZ: We proved two theorems last time, and we used them for-- and we had a couple of applications of them. He says we can define a positive real number to a rational power using elementary facts about the real numbers. Roddiguez: You don't need the exponential and the logarithm to make sense of a real number of power. But we're just going to use the basic properties of exponents throughout all this so we don't use derivatives.
