Summary:
CASEY RODRIGUEZ: We proved two theorems last time, and we used them for-- and we had a couple of applications of them. The first was that a sequence converges to x if and only if the limit as n goes to infinity of the absolute value of xn minus x goes to 0. And then we also had the squeeze theorem, that if you have three sequences-- a sub n, b subn, and x sub n. such that the limit as k goes to infinity of x sub n sub k equals liminf of xsub n. And again, this is a subsequence of a convergent sequence, so it's convergent and convergence of the same thing, L. So that implies that this thing is equal to L. And therefore, the limsup and the liminf equal each other, and they also equal the limit of the original sequence. That is the end of the proof of this theorem. we've only defined what it means to take a real number to an integer power, but-- and n-th roots. So using that, we can then define how totake a real numbers to a rational power. All of that is just to say that what we've done up to now-- these things actually do make sense. You don't need the exponential and the logarithm to make sense of a positive real number. OK? But we're just going to use the basic properties of exponents throughout all this.

The meaning of the wave function is that the norm squared psi of x, norm squared, it's complex, dx is the probability of finding the particle- There's an n in their. Finding the particle-- in the region between x and x plus dx. OK? And third, the superposition principle. If there are two possible configurations the system can be in, which in quantum mechanics means two different wave functions that could describe the system given psi 1 and psi 2. All reasonable functions are equally reasonable as wave functions. There's no primacy in wave functions or in states. your memory. Gainst death and all oblivious enmity shall you pace forth. Your praise shall still find room, even in the eyes of all posterity. So no judgment arise till you yourself judgment arise. You live in this and dwell in lover's eyes. May your day be filled with love and poetry. Whatever state you're in, we will always love you. Signed, Jack Florian, James [INAUDIBLE]. [LAUGHTER] PROFESSOR: Thank you, sir. Every vector can be written as the sum of other vectors, right? So there's no such thing as a state which is not a superposition. In 3D, the wave function would be a function of all three positions x, y and z. Physics tells you this is a good model, and it works really well. And to the degree that it doesn't fit the data, it's wrong. There's no God given basis for the universe. This isn't something we derive. This is something we declare.

He had a lot of love affairs going on he kind of ran out his welcome and all of a sudden he becomes a literary relevance so people actually think wow you actually contribute something instead of you're famous for being famous kind of like some people we might be able to mention. coming in and the sound will be identical in conclusion at the very end he comes back from talking about all of the size in his love for nature and sums it back that you know and I have loved the ocean so just in case you forgot throughout these short two pages to whom he was speaking or addressing we see once again that it is nature and don't forget what an apostrophe is okay remember I told you when we learned it that's hey you're going to need to remember this and people tend to forget for some strange reason.

When you do not have unlimited amount of everything you will have to make a choice, what to produce? In what quantity you should produce a particular good. Allocation is nothing but assignment, allotment, share, but in economics we are more technical about this particular term allocation. So, allocation here means solving these three fundamental or basic questions of economics, and the first question is what to production? The second is how to produce and the third is for whom to produce. Depending on who makes these decisions we have different form of economy, who makes this decisions. the government. So, this is a concept, an extreme concept that we typically do not find, but you would see in newspapers talk about moving towards laissez faire or moving away from laissezes faire. The government. is not a government, it is a body that has the power to decide what happens to people's lives. The. government is not the government. It is a group of people who have the power. to make decisions about people’s lives. It has the ability to make changes to the law. but after 1991 after economic liberalization we are slowly moving towards market based economy, but we are not yet there. One concept that I would like to emphasize here is laissez faire, this is a French word it means leaving it alone. This is an extreme version of market economy where private parties are absolutely free from government interaction, intervention such as tariffs, tax, regulations. So, individuals transact without any interference of the government. But still I would say that we have mixed economy.

review um convolutions and and the architecture of a CNN to make this more clear and put it put it into perspective how it relates to um just standard um dense neural networks I think it's fine um so we talked I think I think most people felt okay about um the actual mechanics of doing a convolution. When you have images and a CNN you can simply just do convolutions instead of your normal matrix multiplication. You have pooling layers if you want to decrease the size of this volume because it can get quite unwieldy. so these are some things that these models wanted to optimize over time accuracy performance and model size um model size is something that has a trade-off if you get too big you lose out on other metrics like accuracy. performance is something directly corresponds to depthwise convolutions and mobile nuts for Edge Computing and things like that. You want to drastically reduce the number of computations that you want to do yep that is basically everything for today thank you guys for coming oh and there will also be a quiz.

The principles of baking show us how to make bread with and without a bereavement. We'll make three breads one with the brief mint and two without one of the breads without the bereavement will be bulk fermented in the fridge for 24 hours. The third one will be made with a brief mint which will be left for 12 hours to ferment then it'll be mixed into the main dough. The breads will then take the same amount of time to make but why would you add the extra step of making a briefment when cold fermenting?

And since I missed my office hours yesterday, I'm gonna have a shortened office hour tomorrow from 1:00 to 2:20. neural transition based dependency parsers. We sort of have gone down that we've halve that error-error rate. And we're now down to sort of about a five percent error rate. Yeah. I'm basically out of time now but there is further work including, you know, at Stanford. It's more accurate than 95 percent, right? So we- we're still going on but I think I'd better stop here today, um, and that's neural dependency parsing. [NOISE]. "What can go wrong?" is a way of saying, ''What can't go wrong?'

Summary:
The dagger algorithm aims to provide a more principled solution to the imitational and distributional Shi problem. The idea in dagger is to actually run the policy in the real world see which states it visits and ask humans to label those States. The goal is to collect data in such a way that P Pi Theta can actually learn from the data it's trained on. The basic version of dagger works like this and that's the version that you will all be implementing in your homework. It's a very simple algorithm to implement if you can get those labels. It can actually get up to fly pretty reliably through a forest dodging trees. experience and they can continuously self-improve and get better and better in principle exceeding the performance of humans now in order to start thinking about that we have to introduce some terminology and notation. We have to actually Define what it is that we want if our goal is no longer just to imitate but we want to do something else. In general we can have arbitrary cost on States and actions and those can Define arbitrary control tasks like not being eaten by tigers or reaching a desired destination. thing you actually want like reaching your destination or avoiding a car accident and then use those with more the more powerful reinforcement learning algorithms. In future weeks, we'll cover more of the powerful algorithms that we'll be covering in the next few weeks. We'll also cover how to use these algorithms to help you get what you want in the real world. Back to the page you came from. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion and @cnnOpinION. We'd like to hear from you. Humans need to provide data for imitation learning which is sometimes fine but deep learning works best when the data is very plentiful. If the if the algorithm can collect data autonomously then we can be in that regime where deep Nets really Thrive. The other thing is that humans are not good at providing some kinds of actions so humans might be pretty good at specifying whether you should go left or right on a hiking trail but not so good at controlling a quadcopter through a remote control. If you want to control a giant robotic spider well good luck finding a human who can operate that.

the string, too, were massless. So we have simply mp plus mw a. And so we can now solve for the tension in the string, which is equal to mp plusmw times g plus a divided by 3. And recall that this tension, that the string is pulling, this is what we called the force that the person [? of ?] the string on the person. And by Newton's third law, that's also, on the washer, that’s also the force. So now that we've combined pulley A, string 2, platform, and washer as our system, we can now address our question. If we measure the acceleration of the person, what is the force that the person pulls the rope down with? Well, of course, that will just be the tension in the string. And with this simple system,we can now apply Newton's second law, F equals ma. And so by thinking about how to choose a system, what could be a very complicated problem, with lots of equations, is simply one equation.

I also like to use accessories cephalic vein along with the median vein of the forearm and of course those hand mains the dorsal venous network.

When we talk about complement and substitute, we have to be clear whether we are talking about the demand side or the supply side. So, what do we mean, when do we say a good is complement in production or complement in supply? Can you give an example, first substitute think about it? Plastic chair to iron chair like. Boeing is a manufacturer of airplanes; it makes civilian airplanes as well as military aircrafts. If there is an increase in price of military aircraft, what would happen? Boeing devote more a space to military. To manufacturing, to manufacture military. aircrafts, it would go down. So, now we have enough knowledge. So that, to talk about the factors affecting the supply schedule or supply function. So, now that we have that knowledge, we can talk about how to get the most out of the resources that are available to us. That's what we're trying to do here. We're going to try and get the best of both worlds. We'll see how it goes from here. It'll be interesting to see how we get on with it. We've got a long way to go, but we're getting there.

It's the only way in all organisms that you make the building blocks de novo that are required for DNA biosynthesis and repair. If you inhibit this enzyme, you have no building blocks. You can't survive. So from a practical point of view, it's the target of drugs they use therapeutically in the treatment of cancer.

Derivative is a linear operation. The product rule fg prime plus gf prime. The quotient rule. And above all, the chain rule. The derivative of this-- of that chain of functions, that composite function is the derivative of f with. respect to g times the derivative. of g with respect to x. That's really-- that it's chains of functions that really blow open the functions or we can deal with. OK so I want to take that derivative, I notice the t is appearing there in the usual place, and it's also inside the integral. this isn't so practical. Tangent parabola, quite practical. Higher order terms, less-- much less practical. But the formula is beautiful because you see the pattern, that's really what mathematics is about. They all fit that pattern and when you add up all the terms, if you have a nice function, then the approximation becomes perfect and you would have equality. And those are the best functions of mathematics and exponential is of course one of them. OK that's calculus. Well, part of calculus. Calculus is the big application of calculus, so it's kind of interesting to see what part of calculus actually get used in differential equations. The derivative of x to the n, the derivative of sine and cosine. Above all, the derivatives of e to the x, which is e tothe x. And I'm going to show you what I see, and it's not everything by any means, but it's some basic ideas, but not all the details you learned.

okay so welcome to the last lecture of this course here in this winter term and what we discussed so far in the course were mainly the so-called backends or optimization engines or probablistic estimation techniques. Today I would like to give a very very of course brief short overview about front ends and one important aspect inside successful front ends on how to determine if a constraint is likely to be a correct one so we are still interested in avoiding to add roam constraints although we've learned that we there are techniques which can deal with outliers in the data Association. Ambiguity or not it's kind of if the uncertainty lips of speakers need to seen all that area to make this is no that's the only place where I actually can match and about the special clustering technique for the original paper where you find all the information here's the work back in also recognizing places using spectral clustered local matches. This is exactly the approach that I presented here and actually a couple of the slides that I use in here or of the images material at least comes from a tin Olsen. I reach all the posts I'm interested in looking into but this does is ignores the loop closures so the uncertainty estimates are too big. I can compute this extremely efficient and I may inspect a few places too much but I should get all the places which I need to inspect in order to make sure I find the course with whatever 95 percent probability. This is what is done in practice to what inverting this matrix age there so far we really tried to explicitly invert it used whatever Spurs to rescue decomposition or whatever techniques we used.

Marketing is about four things creating communicating delivering and exchanging value that's in chapter one so who can tell me what marketing is somebody good what's your name genius chingus go ahead tell us what is marketing i don't know but i know it's about creating right excellent good job. chapter one target market is different from target audience target audience is who we want to buy our product or service. We're going to determine the need is through marketing research. We do focus groups where we have 12 people in a room and with a moderator we ask them a series of questions like what are some of the problems that they have when cooking or baking. We don't have anything statistically significant all we have is the input of 48 people that cost 50,000 dollars to have a lot of experience in marketing. is that going to cost a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to do more intercept in multiple cities and get approximately 1500 respondents now when we do focus groups we also do multiple rounds of focus groups because each round is iterative so we learn from the first round of focus group and then we incorporate that in the next round before we do the quantitative research. i recommend that do the focus groups then we're going to do quantitative research before that now both of those focus groups and questionnaires qualitative and quantitative research as i describe that. For something to be of a good value it doesn't need to be a low price it could be a high price but it's a very high quality and it has a lot of benefits. Value does not mean low price so that's a good example anybody have another example of where something might be very expensive but not the lowest price yes go ahead tell us your name theresa bad.

Summary:
Bentham's principle is "the greatest happiness of the greatest number" He thinks all utility is quantifiable and expressible through money. He also has a doctrine of revealed preference, where we can vary the price to get information about your utility. Bentham allows interpersonal comparisons of utility, so we can say that if you take one unit of utility from one person and give it to another person, you can make comparisons across individuals that we can make across society. And we could even influence your behavior without actually changing your preferences, and that's a very important distinction. classical to what we're going to all neoclassical utilitarianism is a subject with which I will begin on Wednesday. See you then for the next installment of this week's Daily Discussion, which will focus on the role of utilitarianism in the development of the modern world.

Spitzer's integrity is blown it's not like there's some--it's a binary good. People either think he's either a hypocrite or he's not, it' a binary thing. So there might be some goods like integrity that are not easily capture-able in this logic. We should put that out there, but yeah, over here? What about health? It's not quite binary because you can be in medium health, but I think it would be pretty useful to be healthy and then super healthy, ad infinitum.

If they were fully permeable, anything could come and go and they wouldn't be much use frankly. But because they're semi- permeable, only a few things can come and going without extra help.

You send in a bigger magnet, it deflects more" nice bit of experimental data, but we've discovered the energy is, in fact, not just independent of m, but it's independent of l, too. Why?

Summary:
John Guttag: This is the 60002 course, the second half of 600. The main topic of the course is what I think of as computational models. How do we use computation to understand the world in which we live? What is a model? To me, it's an experimental device that can help us understand something that has happened, to build a model that explains phenomena we see every day, or to predict the future, something that hasn't happened. The course is really less about programming and more about dipping your toe into the exotic world of data science. with an objective function that's either to be maximized or minimized. We then often have to layer on top of that objective function a set of constraints, sometimes empty, that we have to obey. So for, example, if I'm going from New York to Boston, I might want to find a route by car or plane or train that minimizes the total travel time. We use these things all the time. I commute to work using Waze, which essentially is solving-- not very well, I believe-- an optimization problem to minimize my time. and I'm going to allow myself 1,000 calories. Well, here what we see is the winner will be greedy by value, happens to find a better answer, 424 instead of 413. So there is no way to know in advance. Sometimes this definition of best might work. Sometimes no definition ofbest will work. You can't get to an optimal solution with a greedy algorithm. On Wednesday, we'll talk about how do you actually guarantee finding an optimal Solution in a better way than brute force. Python uses something called timsort, which is a variant of something called quicksort. timsort has the same worst-case complexity as merge sort. Python uses a sort algorithm called merge sort, which uses a different algorithm called sort. The sort algorithm has a power set of 100. The power set is if you have 100 Vec.value is the largest. So it's pretty obvious that this is going to give you a correct answer. You're considering all possibilities and choosing a winner, but it's usually not very practical.

Expectations play a big role in the decision of all economic actors. Milton Friedman called it the permanent income theory of consumption. You don't want to be moving consumption up and down like crazy. Once you realize, more or less, what you'll get on average, then you should-- consumption should be related to that concept. We will develop a life-cycle theory of Consumption, which says, look, even at the level of an individual, the day-to-day income is not really what determines consumption.

CNN's John Defterios takes a look at three different views of fiscal policy. Keynesian, classical and supply-side views are shown in the atas model. The Keynesian view is based on the idea that if you borrow money and make aggregate demand increase, eventually it will increase. The supply side view is more of a Keynesian approach and focuses on what happens when aggregate demand is increased rather than how much it increases. Defterius: We have three main views of how well fiscal policy works or how well it doesn't work and we're just gonna look at these.

Then we will look at the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics. The Schrodinger operators acquire time dependence, which makes the relation between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics more obvious. So we'll discuss that. We'll find the heisenberg equations of motion and solve them for a particular case today. And we'll go through three cases. variables in, it just becomes identical to the Schrodinger Hamiltonian.

So since it's a power series, you'll differentiate the first term, and you'll get the right thing. Then the second term and you will start getting everything that you need. So it's of limited usefulness. In fact, when we will discuss the rotating magnetic fields for magnetic resonance, we will not solve it in this way. We will try to figure out the solution some other way. All right, so that's all for today. I hope to see in office hours in the coming days.

This is how you define network and the loss function. So you start with some example x, and then you have some-- I guess, this is a matrix vector multiplication module, and you take x inner product multiplied with w and b.

And what I mean by that is that even within linear models, you can try to change the model complexity. So what that means is that you just insist that you always use linear model. But what you change is to decide how many features you use. So you can start with only using one feature or two features like for example, in the house price, where you can use the square foot as the single feature, or you can collect a bunch of other features. That means you have more going to discuss this more next time.

Summary:
Last time we talked about some of the kind of the bigger questions in deep learning theory. And today, we are going to start talking about the optimization perspective in deeplearning for two lectures. The main focus is to analyze what the functions you are optimizing look like so that you can use some trivial or some standard optimization algorithm for it. The bigger question we are trying to address here is that why many optimization algorithm are designed for convex functions. But why they can still work for nonconvex functions? assume that the input are linearly separable, then there is a proof for this. And there are a bunch of other cases where you can have some partial results. Next week, in the next lecture, maybe the second half of next lecture,. I'm also going to give another result, which is somewhat more general. It applies to many different architectures, but it has other kind of constraints. First of all, it doesn't really show exactly these kind of landscape properties.

And in one side, the columns are indexed by the users. And every user probably have an opinion about every item, right? Either they like it or not, so and so forth. So that's why you have to recover all the rest of the entries to serve the users better in the future. And the most used method to solve this is basically nonconvex optimization to find this ground truth matrix M.

Iceland is one of the world's most active volcanic hotspots crafer has erupted 30 times in a thousand years and last blue in the 1980s. Scientists are now preparing to drill into it the is to learn more about how volcanoes behave so that we can better predict eruptions and also tap into a super hot source of energy volcanoes can be spectacular but they're also devastating around the world millions of people live close to them here in Iceland. Researchers here hope their work will change that helping to save lives and money while also pioneering a form of volcano power.

that we are going to be looking for in an estimator, trying to find them to be unbiased. But we'll see that it's actually maybe not enough. So unbiasedness should not be something you lose your sleep over. Something that's slightly better is the risk, really the quadratics risk, which is expectation of-- so if I have an estimators, theta hat, I'm going to look at the expectation of theta hats n minus theta squared. And so for example, if the quadratic risk goes to 0, then that means that thetahat converges to theta in the L2 sense. this constant is 0 for my purposes, or 25 if you prefer. All right. So we'll just keep going on this property next time. And we'll see how from here we can move on to-- the likelihood is actually going to come out of this formula. Thanks.

Maximum likelihood is the function, so we need to maximize a function. Sometimes, you have closed-form solutions. You can take the derivative and set it equal to 0 and solve it. But sometimes, you actually need to resort to algorithms to do that. And we'll briefly touch upon it, but this is definitely not the focus of this class. We'll just keep going on this property next time. OK? Any other question. Thanks.

Summary:
In this problem, we are given a joint PDF for x and y. And then we are asked to compute the variance of x plus y. We're told we should compute this variance by using something called the law of total variance. So first, I want to focus on this term-- the conditional expectation of X plus y conditioned on x. So this is actually just x plus the expectation of y given x. And because it's uniformly distributed and because expectation acts like center of mass, we know that the expectation should be the midpoint.

In the second half of the course, we'll talk about multisequence alignment. We'll also talk about the ClustalWustal algorithm.

Bayes' theorem: Probability of a model and the probability of the sequence are prior probabilities. These are probabilities which are not conditional. They do not depend on something else. Now let's see what all this Bayesian stuff is useful for. We're going to be doing-- of the various applications, we had recognition discrimination and database search. We'll have two models, a model that we actually have a hydrolase and themodel that we have randomness. So we want to report all the sequences where the probability that that sequence is better than that sequence given a null model or random amino acids is significant. Student: Do you know the basis for thinking that the context for a dinucleotide is either an ocean or an island, in other words, only two states? Why couldn't the context be five states? GEORGE CHURCH: OK. Question. Student: Why can't there be more than two states for the context of a dinoinucleotide? Student: I want to know why there can't be more states for dinosucleotides. George Church: I don't know, but I think there must be. will be a recursive algorithm where the score of a two-character string is defined in terms of the maximum of various shorter strings. The number of different cases we have here-- before, it was 3 for a global alignment, which was k, being the number of sequences, was 2. Now k is three for a three-way comparison. And all possible subsets is 2 to the k minus 1, in this case, so it's 7. So seven cases, best score for S1 with each of the others.

Charles Brockden Brown: The Enlightenment is a critique of a kind of impoverished view of mind or consciousness that over-relies on reason. We started to look at it a little bit with Barlow's [assumed spelling] Raven poem with Poe. The idea takes over, things that go on when reason loses its purchase on the mind and the mind becomes maddened for example or goes insane. All of these things are things that Charles Brockden brown starts to explore, right? So again I want to review some of the places that we've been. and I never sleep but with a candle burning at my pillow. Right, so from the confidence of enlightenment, now it's the pathetic I need to have a nightlight on, right? That's what Edgar has sunk to. What has caused all of this? His experience in the woods. And we'll take it up again on Wednesday, the experience of the woods, the story of Edgar's pit and the panther. I want you to look for the motif of light in the Panther scene, and also track one particular word, and that word is savage. that in fact there is something wrong with reason as a faculty, and this can take a couple of forms. One is that all of those nice ideals that come along with the enlightenment may in fact be parasitic precisely on the kinds of negative types of thinking that they are designed to get rid of. The other thing is that reason itself may not be as powerful as we think, that there might be other things going in, on within human consciousness that are either hostile to reason or are its opposite.

Markus Klute: In this chapter, we look at tests and implications of special relativity. One experimental test is stellar aberration, which we discussed can be explained by special relativity and by velocity addition. Light isotropy is being tested in a variety of different experiments, including Michelson-Morley and Kennedy and Thorndike. We will have a discussion of implications ofspecial relativity as we move on from here, Klute says. The final chapter of the special relativity course will be presented in the spring of 2015. and optics, upon the principle of relative movement." We now know this was wrong, but scientific process happens in scientific environment. And I started this class by explaining that one needs to be open minded to learn and to study and to grow scientifically. And one has to question the assumptions, understand the assumptions when then go into measurements. So this is the first part of this chapter where we talk about tests. We will have a discussion of implications of special relativity as we move on from here. One of the hypotheses you could have is that the photon actually is a massive particle. This would directly modify Coulomb's laws, which are tested experimentally. Another class of experiment is where we look directly at time dilation, for example, in the decay of the muon. There is weird electromagnetic effect if you introduce a mass to the photons like torque on a magnetic ring. Again, here precision measurements have been performed. And they're all in agreement with the hypothesis that the photons are massless.

Summary:
In the colonial era, most American women of European descent lived lives much like those of their European counterparts: They were legally and socially subservient to men. Lower and working class women were actually more equal to men of their own classes, but only because they were, like, equally poor. As production shifted from homes to factories, it shifted away from women doing the producing. This led to the so-called “cult of domesticity,” which like most cults, I am opposed to. in comments where you can also ask questions about today’s video that will be answered by our team of historians. Thanks for watching Crash Course and as we say in my hometown, don’t forget to be awesome. Back to the page you came from with this week's Crash Course video. Follow us on Facebook and Twitter @CrashCourse and @CNNOpinion. For more Crash Course videos, visit CNN.com/Crashcourse and follow us on Twitter @cnncrashcourse. American women changed the world for better and for worse, just as great men do. And along the way, they made “the woman question’ part of the movement for social reform in the United States. In doing so, American women chipped away at the idea that a woman’s place must be in the home. That might not have been a presidential election or a war, but it is still bringing real change to our real lives on a daily basis. I’ll see you next week.

the same connection. The pion here is spin 0, and if you discuss this in the rest frame of the pion, the electron and the positron fly off in opposite directions, which means that the spin doesn't in align to 0. So that's why this is highly suppressed. It's not 0, because you can find-- you can put [INAUDIBLE] into a rest frame, where you're just basically looking at both particles from one side that was coming to you, and in that case, it's allowed. In quantum mechanics, the spin of a particle with a vector is quantized. You find that it's square root of f times s plus 1 in units of h-bar. If you want to get an eigenvalue with the physical state of particles, which axis are the right ones to choose-- or, sensible? There's no right and wrong in this discussion. It's not 0, because you can put [INAUDIBLE] into the rest frame, where you're just basically looking at both particles from one side.

In the 5th Century BC Athens was a direct democracy that encouraged wide participation through the principle of ho boulomenos, or anyone who wishes. This meant that any of its approximately 30,000 eligible citizens could attend the ecclesia, a general assembly meeting several times a month. The Athenian system also relied on a 500 member governing council called the Boule, to set the agenda and evaluate proposals. Some ancient philosophers, including Plato, disparaged this form of democracy as being anarchic and run by fools. poll, all examples of how the democratic principle behind sortition still survives today.

For more information, visit the official Java 8 website or follow us on Twitter at @joshjenson and @jenniferjenson. For the latest Java 8 news, visit our news page. The science of classical mechanics establishes an important principle of cause and effect. Newton's Laws of Motion established the scientific principle of analyzing observed phenomenon through the use of clearly articulated mathematical models rather than through intuition. Developing a command of mechanics is a powerful tool for understanding the world around us. 8.01 assumes a strong background in high school level physics and mathematics, so a previous course in calculus is not a prerequisite. It is a rigorous and technically challenging course aimed at MIT undergraduates. In each of these lessons, you will find a series of short lightboard videos that will help you understand concepts.

That's the beginning. Perturbation theory explains the long range interactions by which all gas phase particles attract each other weakly. So that's important too. And so you'll be able to do all of this stuff. So here we have non-degenerate perturbation Theory. And it is isn't just blowing smoke.

If certain amount of output can be produced by given amount of inputs, then the same combination of input puts can also be used to produce less. The key word is feasibility technology. So, if it is feasible to produce half kg of curd from 1 kg of milk, then it is possible to produce 250 grams of curD from 1kg of milk. The second is no free lunch. At least 1 input is required to produce some output, or more than you know more than 1 kind of output. Third is non reversibility, what it means is that a production process cannot be reversed. feasible here, y is taking care of not only inputs but also output. The combination is all given here and this exhibits convexity. This is a simple example of how to make a complex shape. The shape can be any shape at any time. It can be either a shape or a shape-shift shape. It is possible to combine two shapes to create a shape that looks like a shape shape. For example, the shape could look like the shape of a circle or a circle. same proportion, then output will also decrease in the same proportion and this is possible this is feasible fine. The easier is easier way easier although they these two are not same, but the similar 1 implies the other, but not the other way around. If this is the input combination and it is feasible to combine them, in this way and get some output, then also it is also possible to combine lambda x 1 to lambda x 2 of course, here we are not talking about the amount of output.

The Great Wall began as multiple walls of rammed earth built by individual feudal states during the Chunqiu period to protect against nomadic raiders north of China. Under the Han Dynasty, the wall grew longer still, reaching 3700 miles, and spanning from Dunhuang to the Bohai Sea. After the Ming dynasty gained control in 1368, they began to refortify and further consolidate the wall using bricks and stones from local kilns. The wall was formidable but not invincible. Both Genghis and his son Khublai Khan managed to surmount the wall during the Mongol invasion of the 13th Century. main body and expanding this remarkable monument to human achievement.

Summary:
 vector, we have delta x over delta t i hat. And this component here is what we call the component of the average velocity. And, again as before, this component can be positive, zero, or negative depending on the sine of delta x. And the key point here is that average velocity depends on whatever time interval you're referring to. So that's our definition of average Velocity. And now what we want to do is consider what happens in the limit as delta t becomes smaller and smaller. And that will enable us to introduce our concept of instantaneous velocity. The average velocity depends on the time interval t to t plus delta t while the person has displaced a certain amount of vector delta r. So, as a vector, we have delta x over delta t i hat. This component here is what we call the component of the average velocity. And, again as before, this component can be positive, zero, or negative depending on the sine of delta x. And now what we want to do is consider what happens in the limit as delta t becomes smaller and smaller. And that will enable us to introduce our concept of instantaneous velocity.

The Machinery I provided you is powerful enough to solve pretty much any kinematics problem because it's based purely on Geometry angular velocity is a kind of a madeup concept that just simplifies the math. yeah sorry and plus this thing okay we'll end now because Professor Socrates needs to take over this is it this is correct acceleration of P acceleration of Q with respect to B Oiler coris centripedal and you know why it doesn't go to zero because I'm not taking a Omega B cross a omeg B. I'm taking a omega B cross this whole term which is at 90° to a OmegaB got it got it? Yeah sorry and Plus this thingOkay we'llend now because professor Socrates need to takeover. but you need this correction term which is very beautiful done okay so this was the magic formula that I introduced in the last class how would we go about proving this anybody yeah do the math how wouldWe do theMath how would We prove this here's what we'll do let's prove it.

It's often the case that we get ambiguities like the "unlockable" ambiguity. There is more than one way to combine things. And what we'll do is develop tests that allow us to see which way we've combined words in different ways. And we'll find cases where, depending on in what order you combine things, you get different meanings, and our tests will combine with that. All right. We will do this again on Tuesday. a living? How I answer depends on whether I feel like talking to the person or not. If I would like to get them to leave me alone so that I can read a book or whatever, I tell them I'm a theoretical syntactician. That usually ends the conversation fairly quickly. When it doesn't, when they say, "Oh, what's that mean? What do you work on?" Then I will say, well, I'm trying to figure out why some sentences are grammatical and others aren't.

William Wordsworth was a true literary pioneer he defied the conventions of his time by insisting that poetry should be should express deep feelings about everyday experiences. The Rime of the Ancient Mariner for Coleridge was as we'll read here and for the intro for that you know Wordsworth worked with him on that it was going to be a dual credit both of them were going to get credit for it but Wordsworth had to drop out of that but some of the most famous elements of the piece still are in there and they're still a focal point. like I said we first started this particular piece talking about it you know that memory if I am dead if I'm gone think back to this time sister if you can't hear my any longer just remember what my feelings are for you. "This is one I probably say the top three or four most difficult pieces not that it's crazy hard but it's just it's a lot more difficult than reading those pulp" "My voice and my spirit will continue because you'll be experiencing all of these things and thinking in the same mind frame that I was thinking" Sister I've never lost a parent um I don't know if anyone has but I would imagine that's a big gap in your life and you may be bond a little bit more with your siblings maybe she being the only female he has a sense of protection for and so being separated you can imagine the struggle that one might have in dealing with it with the loss. Up until that point you see that the you know his passion he developed for poetry for simple country living and for the natural world was to influence him for the rest of his life.

For most solar cells, this breaks down to the following progression, from the solar spectrum to charge collection. We're going to be focusing on charge separation, incorporating elements of either side. The total system efficiency is the product of each individual component going on in a solar cell.

In the year 2000, four-year college grads actually earned more with their entry jobs than they're earning today. Changing technology has made wages rise more at the top, but has held wages down for a lot of other jobs. A third set of factors has to do with slower economic growth, slower productivity growth and slower dynamism in the U.S. economy, says Tyler Cowen. He says there is less demand for new labor and that makes it harder for a new college graduate to get the job he or she wants.

Summary:
If you have a complex polyhedron, we found general unfoldings. We proved one of them. If you want an edge unfolding, that's the centuries-old open problem. For non-convex polyhedra, we know this is too much to hope for. But for general unfolding, we don't know. So today's lecture is actually mostly about these two open problems and different variations of it that we know how to solve, special cases, and changes in the model. compute the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices, something like this picture, except you don't know what it looks like in 3D. You know every edge must be a shortest path. So the edges are some subset of these guys. And so you've got lots of little convex polygons here. We know it must make a convex polyhedron. If it made two, Cauchy's rigidity theorem would tell you that they're the same. So even once you fix the gluing, you know that there's a unique convex realization. that's why you get exponential, in general. On the other hand, if your tree happens to be nice and balanced, doubling is not so bad because here you'll have constant. This a double everything below, but there's only log n levels. So is that linear? It should be about linear. It's certainly 2 to the theta log n, and it matters what this constant is. I think it's n or maybe n squared, but not too bad. So if you're lucky and the just the structure true just viewing p prime as p and p as p prime.

And so what we're going to do is use the right hand rule to define a direction that tells you both the direction it defines the plane and it also tells you what the positive direction of rotation is for that plane. Now, in the k hat direction, in this case, I'm going to call it in the arbitrary n hat direction.

In week four, we take a break from learning more and more on neural network topics, and talk about final projects, but also some practical tips for building neural network systems. Today's lecture is the primary content for what you'll be using for building your assignment 4 systems. In the early 1950s, there started to be work on machine translation. Claims were made that the computer would replace most human translators. When you go in for full scale production what will the capacity be? We should be able to do about with a modern commercial computer about one to two million words an hour. that can sometimes improve performance. And we actually have that trick in the assignment 4 system. And you can try it out. So we generate along and generate our whole sentence in this manner. And that's proven to be a very effective way of getting more information from the source sentence more flexibly to allow us to generate a good translation. I'll stop here for now and at the start of next time. I will finish this off by going through the actual equations for how attention works. One French word gets translated as several English words. You can get the reverse, where you can have several French words that get translated as one English word. So mis en application is getting translated as implemented. And you can get even more complicated ones. So here we sort of have four English words being translated as two French words. But they don't really break down and translate each other well. I mean, these things don't only happen across languages. They also happen within the language when you have different ways of saying the same thing. And so even are somewhat flimsy terms.

Summary:
In almost all cases when you address atoms, you do two photon courses because a photon is scattered. In reality, it is a two photon process and not two single photon processes. If you have any doubts about some subtleties about how is light absorbed and emitted, the correct answer is always obtained from the two-photon picture. In this chapter on two photons, I'm completely focused on the resonant terms. But since four terms is still too many, I want to just tell you what is special about two photons. this is what we want to discuss on Wednesday. And this is what I referred to as the fundamental limit of spontaneous emission because we have not lost any coherence here. It's just if the phase is only imprinted in one particle-- one particle quantum physics sets us a limitation. Oh well, we can read out the phase phi. OK. Any question? To be continued on Monday.

It is exactly the same you have seen probably more than 100 times. People who want to measure fundamental constants-- the Rydberg constant-- want to compare lame shift with first principle QED calculations, sort of test the precision of quantum electrodynamics. This is the case for hydrogen. And, actually, with some advance in the numeric calculation of wave functions and all that, it may also be possible to do it with helium. I think so far it hasn't kind of-- helium has not replaced hydrogen.

But as usual, a couple administrative notes before we dive into the material. As a reminder the project proposals for your course projects were due on Tuesday. And again, when working on assignment two, remember to stop your Google Cloud instances when you're not working to try to preserve your credits. For assignment two you really only need to use GPU instances for the last notebook. is really great for research. If you're interested in production deployment, you should probably look at Caffe, Caffe 2 or TensorFlow. PyTorch is a great choice. But it's a bit newer, has less community support, less code out there, so it could be a bit of an adventure. So it's kind of unfortunately, there's not just like one global best framework, it kind of depends on what you're actually trying to do, what applications you anticipate. The midterm will be in class on Tuesday, five nine. It'll be sort of pen and paper working through different kinds of, slightly more theoretical questions to check your understanding of the material that we've covered so far. And I think we'll probably post at least a short sort of sample of the types of questions to expect. So just, Yeah, yeah, so that's what we've done in the past is just closed note, closed book, relatively just like want to check that you understand the intuition behind most of the stuff we've presented.

But Aristotle's mixed constitution differs from ours still in certain important respects, he says. He doesn't so much insist, as you will see in your reading, on the actual separation of functions of government. the back door. On Friday, let me just remind you, Il Principe. We'll study Machiavelli. On this very partisan note I conclude. On Thursday, we'll study the life of the Italian statesman and play a game of chess with him. We're going to see how well he can play the game of poker. I'm looking forward to it. I hope you'll join us for the game on Friday night at 8 p.m. ET on CNN. the back door.

Summary:
SNLI is the Stanford Natural Language Inference Corpus-- MultiNLI, and Adversarial NLI. SNLI is a big data set. It has over 550,000 training examples. And it has dev and test sets. Each have 10,000 examples balanced across the three classes. We estimate human performance at 92% for SNLI, because Sam Bowman has been curating that data. We can mark progress on SNLI because we can mark back into our underlying domain that you might have in mind. SNLI and MultiNLI into Turkish. XNLI is a bunch of assessment data sets that is dev-test splits for more than a dozen languages. Those are human-created translations that could be used to benchmark multilingual NLI systems. So there's a wide world of tasks you can explore, and I think that makes NLI a really exciting space in which to develop original systems, and projects, and so forth. And those could be interesting for seeing how well a model can grapple with variation that comes in very specific and technical domains. unanimous gold label. And we rate the overall human level of agreement at about 91.2% for the gold labels. And the overall Fleiss kappa measured interannotator agreement was 0.7, which is a high rate of agreement. And then for the leaderboard, you can check out this link here. Sam has been good about curating all the systems that enter. It's clear at this point, for example, that ensembles of deep learning methods are the best for this problem.

Summary:
In a perfectly competitive market, the firm is a price-taker. No matter how many units they produce, they're just going to be able to get that same market price. A firm in an imperfectly competitive market will have their own firm-specific demand curve. The price that they get in the market is higher than the marginal cost and the marginal revenue at that point. Folks are willing to pay more than that marginal cost, but you still have no motivation to produce more.

Summary:
Rigidity is really about the lack of motion. In infinitesimal motion, you can think about this in the absence of a motion. You need some smoothness. If there's a way to get started moving, that doesn't actually mean you could actually move. So we're going to need some linear algebra. That's one thing that's useful. So the idea is we think about rigidity-- does a linkage move or not-- to the first order. First order means first derivative. still buy them at the hardware store. That's it. You can't buy them online. You have to buy them from the store. They are not available online. They can be bought at the store, but you have to pay for them in cash. They're not available on the internet. You must buy them in the store to get them. You cannot buy them on the Internet. They must be bought from the hardware stores. That is it. They have to be bought in the stores. I'm saying is if it's non-zero for some choice of C, then it should be non- zero for this choice ofC. And if you find such a configuration C-- or I guess we call this a realization C-- then that C is generic. So it's not useful in a computable way, but it's a definition. It's a little bit nicer. And now there's a bunch of fun facts about infinitesimal motions still buy them at the hardware store.

Summary:
Chess has been known as a tool of military strategy, a metaphor for human affairs, and a benchmark of genius. The game was originally known as chaturanga– a Sanskrit word for "four divisions" With its spread to Sassanid Persia, it acquired its current name and terminology– "chess," derived from "shah," meaning king. Chess-playing computers had been developed for decades, but Deep Blue’s triumph over Garry Kasparov in 1997 was the first time a machine had defeated a sitting champion.

Summary:
this week will probably go live tomorrow uh not quite sure yet but you'll try to get it up as soon as possible so I guess like without further Ado let's Jump Right In. I'm gonna go somewhat into detail into what representation learning is and I think this should sort of cap out the last few weeks of deep learning um and probably give you a more comprehensive understanding of what deep learning actually is doing. So I guess before we jump into deep learning let's talk a bit about shallow learning. In terms of neural networks embeddings are pretty important so they are often described as lower dimensional learns continuous Vector representations of discrete variables. Embeddings are useful because they can reduce the dimensionality of your categorical variables for example and meaningfully represent them in the transform space. The idea is that if we can directly work with the significant somehow find a way to represent this line using just one variable instead of three that's going to be better because a high dimensional data can be very complex. and that will have a homework so if you ever need to review uh the topics from this lecture so to work on that homework this slide deck should be up on the website again if you feel free to do that. That is it for today a second pause. Back to the page you came from. The slide deck for this lecture is now available on our website again. Click through the slide deck to see the rest of the lecture. The lecture will be available again on the site later this week. Aryan is presenting today's lecture on pre-training with Verona. Aryan is one of the facilitators for this decal. The lecture will be on Advanced Techniques and as software CV. There is a homework for this entire cluster which is high Crush notebook that should be due next Tuesday even though this lecture doesn't have any homework. There will also be a lecture on SSL for CV and that will be that there will be a slide deck for that. The slide deck should be up on the website again if you feel free to do that.

Third lecture on Foundation mulative AI. Next time we'll talk about stable diffusion image generation. We'll have two guest speakers and then we'll end with the lecture on AI ethics and regulation as well as a panel. We apply this self-supervised learning where we learn without label data so we can get as much data as we want because there's no human being in the loop. There's no limit how much we can scale this up and what we get from this by learning from observation and learning from the data directly is a very contextual understanding of meaning. the World by looking at videos right you can even sort to understand how human beings work even better because you can see people being upset or sad or happy whatever right in in a video and start picking these cues up. You can connect the vision part to the text part and get a multimodality model that's able to do both in a really really sophisticated way uh also something that I think these these people are working on all right thank you thank you for your time and good luck with your book. Force things to comply to Simple Rules right it kind of abandons our ability to understand and compress what we're seeing and deals with that chaos directly that's why AI is so powerful and so humanlike. CTP was trained at a scale with an amount of data and parameters that we never seen before so this is a a year old now but this is I think this was 3.5 or something the first version it was using 175 billion parameters and just training the the final model cost around $5 million just in in Compu electricity bills.

Summary:
The EM algorithm is an unsupervised version of k-means GMM. In GMM, you guess randomly an assignment of every point to the cluster, the probability. You guess where they're probabilistically linked, that is, what's the probability of these points belong to cluster one, this point belongs to cluster two. And then once you have that, you then solve some estimation problem that looks like a traditional supervised learning. The decomposition is quite important. And we're going to try and kind of abstract that away. do this when you have something that sums to 1. It's not more complicated than what I wrote here, but make sure independently you go through it and ask questions. In the next class, as I said, what we're going to see is this notion of factor analysis. And that is going to tell us how to apply EM to a different kind of setting, which, at first glance, will look kind of impossible to do without a latent variable model. And I think that's all I want to say. Just means I have an internal solver that's fast and I kind of trust, and I have something on the outside that's a latent variable that I'm like splitting up the modeling. It's one of a number of decomposition strategies. Doesn't mean it's the only way to solve it, though. All right, so the question is, how do we construct L of t? And I claim we know everything else. OK? So let's look term by term. So here, I'm just introducing Q. And this way, set the thetas, do a descent on them, or ascent in this case. Do argmax.
