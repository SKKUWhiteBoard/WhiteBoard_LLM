John ESSIGMANN: I measure my blood sugar at different times during the day. Gluconeogenesis technically means new synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors. The medicine I take is called Metformin. It has a number of targets, but one of them is one of the enzymes, called PEPCK, Pyruvate Carboxykinase, that's in the gluconeogenic pathway. The liver provides a constant stream of glucose to organs that absolutely require it, like our brain.

Summary:
In this lecture, we introduce and develop the concept of independence between events. If I tell you that a certain event A has occurred, this will generally change the probability of some other event B. In such a case, we say that events A and B are independent. We will then proceed to define the independence of a collection of more than two events. Finally, we will close with an application in reliability analysis and with a nice puzzle that will serve as a word of caution about putting together probabilistic models.

No matter how gentle you try to handle your dough you will always de-gas it if only a little bit in today's comparison video we'll make 4 breads they will be made from the same dough but they will all be treated differently. The first one of the four breads will be left alone from the beginning of fermentation until it's baked. The final one will be folded shaped and degassed three times and we won't be fermenting them for the same amount of time.

Summary:
Of the nearly 11,000 amendments proposed in the centuries since, only 27 have succeeded. The founders of the United States were trying to create a unified country from thirteen different colonies. For an amendment to even be proposed, it must receive a two-thirds vote of approval in both houses of Congress. To actually change the Constitution, the amendment must be ratified by three-quarters of all states. Americans today are the most politically polarized since the Civil War, making it nearly impossible to reach a broad consensus. Court justices are unelected and serve for life once appointed, this is far from the most democratic option. Interestingly, the founders themselves may have foreseen this problem early on. In a letter to James Madison, Thomas Jefferson wrote that laws should expire every 19 years rather than having to be changed or repealed. Although he believed that the basic principles of the Constitution would endure, he stressed that the Earth belongs to the living, and not to the dead. He wrote that every political process is full of obstacles that distort the will of the people.

as a nurse you want to be familiar with heart blocks and in this review i'm going to be talking about third degree heart blocks also known as a complete heart block. This type of heart block is the worst of all blocks and the reason is occurring is because electrical signal from the atria isn't making it to the ventricles. The person could be born with it so it could be congenital or the person has severe heart disease or they have a myocardial infarction or they're taking some type of medication. could progress to death so what you want to do is activate that emergency response system and this will get a team in the room to help you now some treatment that can be given to that patient is that atropine can be administered to help that heart pump more efficiently or the patient could be connected to a temporary pacemaker which will again get that heart beating correctly so we can maintain cardiac output. Eventually the patient will need a permanent pacemaker implanted okay so that wraps up this review over third degree heart block.

There's no other cars that you have to overtake, but you're kind of on your own and try to do it as fast as possible, 150 mils off road. After driving six hours and 53 minutes at an average speed of 90 miles an hour, Stanley is about to become the first vehicle in history to drive 132 miles by itself. After months of tireless effort, there's a lot at stake. The devil is really in the details, in the long tail of special events that can happen when you're driving. You can measure progress by just demo videos, which is one way, and it gives you some kind of feel for what's going on. Another way to measure progress is to see how are these cars doing relative to human drivers. Let's see what else did we not cover yet? I want to spend a little more than two minutes on that, so let's keep it for today. Bye.

Summary:
David Kaiser: particle cosmology is a new subfield within physics. He says it studies the smallest units of matter, the fundamental forces and elementary constituents of matter. Kaiser: The field is doing pretty well these days by other measures. Its annual budget just within the U.S. is on the order of $1 billion a year, roughly, he says. It is really a booming, booming subject of study, Kaiser says. The field literally didn't even exist 45 years ago, he adds. M1 M2 over R squared-- that unit strength of gravity. Brans and Dicke modify Einstein's theory of general relativity in response to this challenge of Mach's principle. They add an extra dimensionless constant, a fudge factor, that they labeled by the Greek letter omega. As omega becomes larger and larger, the field is much less likely to vary either in a time or space way, they say. And so, in some sense, you're stiffening up the trampoline. In 1979, two separate theorists working independently of each other suggested that the two fields might be literally the same, not just comparable or considering side by side. So it's not that they're somehow intrinsically different from each other. Instead, their status, instead, is what people assess them on. That's what we'll pick up in the next part of our chat with Dr. Alex Tsiolkovsky, the director of the Centre for Theoretical Physics at the University of Toronto. asymptotic freedom. And actually, it's the reason why our friend and colleague here at MIT, Frank Wilczek, received the Nobel Prize. So this was work introduced by Frank and his then advisor David Gross, and independently by a different very young grad student at the time, David Politzer. And what they found was that the strength of the strong nuclear force, that QCD force that we talked about quite a bit at the end of last class session, that the force actually decreases with the energy scale. a continuous unitary symmetry, which is like saying you could rotate the electron field by any continuum amount, and the equations remain unchanged. The photon only has to mop up a relatively simple symmetry, the U1 gauge symmetry. SU2 was what I was pointing to when I was referring to the weak nuclear force. That's a discrete symmetry structure. SU3, that refers to three different color charges of quantum chromodynamics. And so therefore, the gluons have still a different set of properties, so that's right. Alan Guth: Few physicists today think Brans-Dicke theory of gravity best describes our Universe. He says interest in the field grew even as it was getting experimentally less and less favored. Guth: New generation of theorists trained to work at this interface. They had all kinds of potential roles to play in new work that we'll look at together next time on inflation, he says. "We'll have more opportunities to make fun of Alan Guth, which is what's in it for me" the hall from Alan's. And by a quirk of the old building 6, we had the same key. A single key would open the whole hallway. Couldn't get rid of it now. And one time, my parents were visiting. And I basically broke into Alan's office. They couldn't believe me when I described what it was like to try to work with this person. So I actually broke into his office to show them the safety violation, fire code violation, horror show that was the den of entropy. So that's a true story.

Judy Hoyt: We're going to discuss the accurate control and placement of active dopant regions through a process called dopant diffusion. The placement of those regions determines many of the so-called short channel characteristics of MOSFETs that we'll talk about. The doping of other materials, not just the silicon itself, but of the polysilicon gate affects things like gate depletion and limits how well the gate voltage controls the channel potential, Hoyt says. The equation numerically, essentially, for an arbitrary doping profile is 1 over the integral of the carrier concentration minus the background concentration. of cases where there are analytic solutions. We talked about the diffusion of a Gaussian profile with a fixed dose. We apply this diffusion to a constant surface concentration. And finally -- we talk about the diffusion of a complementary error function, which we apply for a constant level of surface concentration. The diffusion of this error function can be applied to a fixed level of surface concentration, or a constant level of substance on the surface, for example.

Machine learning is about how to acquire a model and acquire the parameters of a model, from data and experience. In the next few lectures, we're going to work through a sequence of different takes on machine learning that are going to highlight different subsets of the big ideas on this topic. We'll see today exactly how data kind of goes through the mill and gets turned into a model. And we'll see more in-depth examples and more structured examples of these kinds of problems later on when we talk about applications. is going to be at least one pixel off of something else you've seen. So you can't just collect all the data. You can get data that is similar, but then, in the end, you're going to have to generalize. And so, we'll talk about how that's going to work. What features might you use to detect digits? Well, somebody puts a grid of numbers. Your eyes and your visual processing system is already doing all kinds of processing. People will think about computer vision, replicate some of that processing. the thing we're trying to do is to fit a curve to this data. So you say, what is the fit? Is the fit getting as close as possible to the last dot? So what is my constant approximation to this? Does anybody want to hazard a guess? Let's call it five. OK, did I fit something about this data? Yeah, I felt something about the data. I fit basically it's mean. Did I capture the major trends? No. All right, let's try again. Let's fit a linear function. It's close, right? It's a better fit than the constant function. Notice that when I went to linear function, the space of hypotheses grew. Instead of just lines, now it's like lines with slopes and intercepts. In Naive Bayes probabilistic models, over-fitting usually shows up as zeros in your probability table. In other methods, it's actually going to show up in totally other ways. So let's figure out some ways to do that, to just illustrate what it would like to look like. We could take that polynomial and limit the degree of the polynomials. Using it under a hypothesis, you can also shrink the hypothesis space, so you can fit less under it. We already know one kind of over-fit to limit that. In general, your model is going to make errors. In spam classification, we found out that it wasn't enough to just look at words. For digit recognition, you do sort of more advanced things than just looking at pixels. You can add variables into your Naive Bayes model, but we'll also talk in the next few classes about ways to add these more flexibly and also induce these right, right? All right, I'm going to stop there for today and as you go, please come and grab some more candy.

A mixture of public and private activities that tilted towards short-term economic thinking, speculation and irresponsible spending. The Wall Street Wamboozle, the Financial Fartstorm. In 2008 Obama’s election seemed a political watershed and not just because he was the first African American president. He appeared to break Republicans’ solid hold on the south, he won Virginia, and North Carolina and Florida, and his supporters represented a coalition of African Americans, and Hispanics, white liberals and, especially, young people. So Obama promised to change the culture of Washington. He would end partisan squabbling…. sorry I couldn’t even get through that sentence. He also wanted a foreign policy based on diplomacy, he wanted to reduce inequality and increase access to health care. depends on who you ask. The stimulus is estimated to have saved about 3 million jobs, but it also increased the deficit quite a bit.

HONG LIU: Last time, we talked about this IR-UV connection between the bulk and the boundary. Now let's talk about some further aspects of the duality. HONG LIu: Once you realize there's such relation, since the two sides are completely different objects, so the game is that you really have to do lots of guess work. Your support will help MIT OpenCourseWare continue to offer high quality educational resources for free. To make a donation or to view additional materials from hundreds of MIT courses, visit MIT Open courseWare at ocw.mit.edu. HONG LIU: There is a conformal symmetry of a d dimensional series SO d, 2. And on this side, there's precisely the same group, which is isometry of Ads5. In N equals 4 super Yang-Mills theory, we discussed last time there are six scalar fields. You can rotate them each other. And this can be considered as coming from the D3 brane. So essentially, you have eight supercharge of the [INAUDIBLE]. So this all together is 32 real superchargers. a general correspondence between some conformal field theory and some AdS gravity theory. HONG LIU: Yang-Mills theory lives on Minkowski space. And then you say you can imagine that this is the boundary, this relation is related to the bulk and the boundary. And this is a postulate based on that fact. AUDIENCE: So if it's a sort of postulate that's just thinking about it, it's not required that the theory live on the boundary of AdS.

Bolek Wyslouch: How do you convert a given physical system with all the forces, et cetera, into some sort of fixed form, fixed type of notation? Bolek: We will work on two, again, simple physical systems, one that consists of two pendula driven by forces of gravity, each of them. And we will discuss various interesting-- even though the system is very simple, just two masses, a spring, a little bit of gravity on top of that. BOLESLAW WYSLOUCH: I could put it with me some spaceship, and go to a place where the gravity is different, right? Why not? So what would happen? So if gravity changes, then basically what will happen is both this term and that term will change. So let's try to see what happens on the Moon. It's a little bit not completely clear what's going on, but you see, actually the motion is kind of strange. It looks kind of messy, doesn't it? like this. OK? So there are in fact two-- when you look at this picture, you can see two frequencies. One which is clear the oscillation of the-- high-frequency oscillation. But there's also this kind of overarching frequency of much smaller frequency, and this is what corresponds to a difference of two things. So we see this here. We see it on the pendula. But now what we are going to do is we're going to try to hear it, right? So this is a demonstration which maybe it works, maybe not.

The TAs gave a hint that would have let you solve the problem as written. But that's more difficult than what we had intended for you guys. So maybe you'll see the distinction between those things and understand why one version of the problem is much easier than another. So we've got two lectures left discussing linear algebra before we move on to other topics. because you didn't do pivoting-- you'd like to do pivoted in order to minimize the numerical error. Or you need to reorder inorder to minimize fill-in. As an example, I've solved a research problem where there was something like 40 million equations and unknowns. If you reorder those equations, then you can solve via Gaussian elimination pretty readily. But if you don't, well-- my PC had-- I don't know-- like, 192 gigabytes of RAM. The elimination on that matrix will fill the memory of that PC up in 20 minutes. And you'll be stuck. model I showed you last time works.

So the probability that I'm in a certain cell at level i is this Pi. And there's some sparse matrix A which spreads that probability out. And we'll see the simulation that tells us how probable it is to find the Plinko chip. Yes?

Summary:
A random variable is a number that's produced by a random process. The number of faulty pixels in a monitor is also produced from an unpredictable randomness. The event that C equals 1, that's an event that-- it's a set of outcomes where the count is 1 and it has a certain probability. There are 3 possible outcomes among the 8 outcomes of heads and tails with 3 coins. The probability that C greater than or equal to 1 is 7/8. And when the outcome is translated into a real number that you think of as being produced as a random variable, it's what the random variable does. hold in circumstances where pairwise does hold. So this is good to know. We'll be making use of it in an application later when we look at sampling and the law of large numbers. Back to Mail Online home.back to the page you came from.

The disadvantage of this particular formulation is that it ends up with a four degree polynomial which means that it could give up to a total of four possible solutions. The question becomes whether can we find the solution directly from any four point correspondences such that the solution is unique? The answer is yes and it was formulated by quan at all in a paper that was published in the 1990s. forms a plane then this is also a degenerate case and that's the end of today's lecture thank you mx equals to zero.

Markus Klute: If there is a time dilation effect due to gravitational fields, then there's also a redshift which is of gravitational fields. He asks you to estimate the magnitude of this effect. Klute says the speed of light is pretty fast, 3 times 10 to the 9 meter per second. And this distance is only 22 and 1/2 meters, so we find that this is a tiny, tiny,tiny effect, he says. But nevertheless, experimentalists at Harvard tested this effect in the 1950s and '60s.

In this video, we're going to compute some useful quantities for the exponential random variable. The CDF of x is the probability that X is less than or equal to little x. We use the standard formula, which is minus infinity to infinity t times fx of t dt. For this, if you evaluate the balance, 0 makes this 0, and 0 to get 1 over. And so the expectation is 1 over lambda, and so the variance is part c, so OK, so far so good.

Professor: Can you explain the physical significance of the crystal momentum? Professor: The information about the momentum can be encoded in these spatial variation of the phase of the wave function. Professor: A central property from the Schrodinger equation is at the time variation d dt of p is equal to the expectation value of minus d the potential of x d x. The momentum expectation value is time independent, so it can be written in the form of e cubed, equal to e to the minus i upon h bar p l. we just give up on quantum mechanics and say it totally failed? And so this is a totally reasonable question, and I want to emphasize something important to you. That model led to a prediction, which is that if you put a capacitor plate across a perfect crystal, then you would get no current flowing across. And that is manifestly what happens with copper. But the experimentalist comes back to you and says look dude. That is a ridiculous model because the copper isn't in fact perfect. So how do you test the model? Well there are two ways to test-- to deal with the situation. The probability of finding the particle at point A is given by chi a squared. And similarly, the probability that we find the second particle at b is this thing norm squared. But we also studied the symmetric configuration, which was equal to 1 over root phi, root 2. This should be a correct description of many experiments, this should be totally awesome. But it's deeply disconcerting, because I could've taken these particles, put them in this entangled state, and sent one particle off to a distant planet. And my sister measures this second particle and determines what state it's in. Einstein created a thought experiment which we're going to study in detail next week called the EPR experiment. He left Germany in 1932 December, about three weeks before Hitler took power. And he did so with decisiveness and dispatch and a head of almost all of his. German-Jewish physicist colleagues and those German physicists for whom the Hitler regime was unacceptable. The three of them talk about it. They write the paper and they put it out. And I want to share with you, actually, a really lovely description of the way the problem was represented in a way by a book that I recommend to all of you.

Danqi Chen is one of the foremost researchers in question answering. She is the professor at the Princeton University. Danqi once upon a time was the head TA of CS224N. She's quite familiar with the context of this class. So today I'm very happy to introduce to you some of the fundamentals in this field, as well as on cutting edge and state of the art topics. So here's my plan for this lecture. I'm going to spend the most of this lecture focused on one type of question answering problems called reading comprehension. like 10-ish minutes to talk about a more practical, and in my opinion, more exciting problem called open domain question answering. Question answering, or, let's say QA in short, is one of the earliest NLP tasks, and the early systems can even date back to the 1960s. And, the question and answer has enabled a lot of really useful real world applications. For example, today if you just put your question in a search engine like Google, you can actually click on the correct answer, which is actually our concise answer. The key difference between the generative model and the extractive model is that for generative models, you can actually leverage more input passage together and do the generation. So for this model, there isn't any retrieval. So this model really has you relying on all the parameters you memorized, all the information. So by just taking this input, it has to just rely on the parameters to infer this answer. So it's actually very hard to-- yeah, it's a definite balance between memory and the generalization from it, yeah.

The assignments, [inaudible] are they limited to TensorFlow? asked the question if, if the assignment is limited toTensorFlow. I'm pretty sure that everything relies that you're using Tensor Flow. Last week we discussed value function approximation, particularly linear value function approximations. Today we're gonna start to talk about other forms of valuefunction approximation in particular, um, uh, using deep neural networks. We're mostly not gonna talk so much about enormous action spaces, but we are gonna think a lot about really large state spaces. And so, instead of having a table to represent our value functions, we were gonna use this generic function approximation where we have a W now, which are some parameters. that it does is it has fixed Q targets. Um, so to improve stability, and what we mean by stability here is that we don't want our weights to explode and go to infinity which we saw could happen in linear value function. We're gonna fix the target weights that are used in the target calculation for multiple updates. So, instead of always update- taking whatever the most recent one is, we're just gonna fix it for awhile and that's basically like making this more stable.

in this video we're going to discuss what externalities are in economics. An externality is when you do something that affects the well-being or the good of another person or a company but you're neither harmed or rewarded for what you did to that person so the externalities can be positive they can be negative. A negative exTERNality is where you've harmed someone you've done something to somehow impose a cost on someone or some some company or something and you haven't reimbursed that person. where you have a negative externality like pollution or something like that it would be overs supplied relative to what is socially efficient or optimal. Where you have an over-supply of something like pollution, for example, you would have it over supplied in a way that would be socially efficient and optimal. For example, if you have pollution, it would have to be over supplied to avoid it becoming a problem. This would be a way to reduce the amount of pollution or other negative externalities in the environment.

Political philosophy is the oldest of the social sciences. It can boast a wealth of heavy hitters from Plato and Aristotle to Machiavelli, Hobbes, Hegel, Tocqueville, Nietzsche. The study of the great books or great thinkers of the past can easily degenerate into a kind of antiquarianism, into a sort of pedantry, says Professor Steven Smith. But these works provide us with the most basic questions that continue to guide our field, he says. "The ideas of John Maynard Keynes, both economists and political philosophers, when they are right, are more powerful than is commonly understood," says Smith.

Ahern: I have never had an exam where I had fewer questions. There were maybe 10 questions I got on the exam and that was for a class of this side. I find most students are honest. I've only had a handful of situations where in this class, where I've had dishonesty as an issue. The only students I've ever had with serious dishonesty issues actually were in smaller classes interestingly enough. But it has happened here and I do have taped evidence when it does happen. So that's why I do it. One of these is an enzyme we've been talking about some already, that's the carbonic anhydrase. Carbonic anHydrase can catalyze the conversion of a million molecules of substrate into product per second, per enzyme. The basic mechanisms are the same. We created a nucleophile, the nucleophile attacks the carbonyl group, the peptide bond breaks, and the pieces go their way. This business of creating nucleophiles is not unique to proteases. There are other enzymes that use nucleophile and generation of nucleophile in their catalytic mechanisms. Most enzymes have a fairly narrow pH range where they work that's ideal. Most of our body tissues are at a pH of 7 to 7.4. At pH 9, this enzyme is far more active than it is at pH 7, indicating that a very, very important step is the removal of that proton. The faster the nucleophile can form, the faster the enzyme is going to be. If the enzyme structure is stable at pH 10, the enzyme will be better at 10 than at 7. Because it's easier to make that nucleophile at 10.

A random variable can take different numerical values depending on the outcome of the experiment. Some of the possible numerical values of a random variable will be more likely than others. We will describe these relative likelihoods in terms of the so-called probability mass function, or PMF. The PMF is also sometimes called the probability law or the probability distribution of a discrete random variable. We use a subscript, X, to indicate which random variable we're talking about. And it has a probability. And in our case this probability is equal to 1/2.

Protein three-dimensional structure and its implications for the binding of small molecules such as drugs. How can we use these basic motifs to recognize other macromolecules, other proteins and nucleic acids? We have these motifs that we could find, weight matrices for them by aligning lots of sequences. Now instead of aligning sequences, let's see what we can do by mutating both the protein part and the nucleic acid part. And then we know from the three dimensional structure that it interacts mainly with the middle nucleotides. increases the risk of Alzheimer's, and probably increases cardiovascular fitness through ApoE refers to its involvement in cholesterol metabolism and transport. The ancestral form of this, for example, found in chimpanzees at nearly 100%, is this arginine 112, instead of what's now common in human populations was cysteine 112. One explanation for that might be that our nutritional standards have changed. We now eat a lot more fatty things. And so maybe this was something that was-- this bad allele, E4, was good in chimpanzees that have different diets or lifespans. The idea of chemical diversity, in a way I hope nicely connects to where we've been with RNA arrays. RNA arrays, and the double-stranded RNA array that we used earlier in class today, can be generated in a commentorial sense. Solid phase comes up again and again in arrays. It's very obvious why you have a solid phase. You want to be able to address it by its positions in x and y on the array. And it's a fantastic way of getting purification of your products simply by washing rather than doing complicated purification procedures.

HONG LIU: So if you want to compute, say, some scattering amplitude from alpha to beta-- so alpha's some initial state and beta's some final state. Say alpha consists of momentum p1 and PN-- or pm, and beta, say momentum p m plus 1 and pn. And then you can get this scattering amplitude just by taking your momentum-space correlation function, OK, for the n points. So this is obtained by doing a Fourier transform. So any questions on this? Yes? AUDIENCE: So can you explain again why this diagram, like, you have one branch and then there's a loop? Klein-Gordon equation, if you interpret it as a wave equation, suffers some-- suffers from some difficulties. So Dirac proceeded trying to correct those difficulties, to overcome those difficulties. It turns out that the Dirac equation solved the first problem, OK, but didn't really solve the second problem. So nowadays, we interpret this this is the-- gives the field theory for-- OK, so of course, Dirac didn't know this, so essentially, he discovered this beautiful theory for the wrong motivation.  Dirac's idea of a Lorentz covariant equation was a "stroke of genius," he says. He says it would have to have a relativistic wave as its solution, and at least the wave should have a type of solution. But Dirac says it could also have a Hermitian solution, which would make it more general. Dirac: "There was nothing like this before. Just even from a mathematical point of view, it's purely, purely imaginative, OK?"

Summary:
The U.S. Supreme Court is the highest federal court in the United States. The job is for life, barring resignation, retirement, or removal from the court by impeachment. So far, six justices have been foreign-born, at least one never graduated from high school, and another was only 32 years old when he joined the bench. Most presidents nominate individuals who broadly share their ideological view, so a president with a liberal ideology will tend to appoint liberals to the court. Of the 112 justices who have held the position, not one has yet been removed from office.

Jake Xia: This is the second time we are having this class. The purpose of this course is really to give you a sampling menu to see how mathematics is applied in modern finance. We will be doing a bit more polling along the way, mainly to get feedback of how you feel about the class. And so hopefully, this will give you enough information to decide this is a field you would like to pursue in your future career. The class will be held every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon from 2:30 to 4:00. On his first day at Morgan Stanley he asked a question about volatility. His desk quant look at him, said-- this is supposed to be options trading desk, so he look at me puzzled. So instead of answering my question, he handed over a training manual for new employees and new analysts. He opened the training manual and looked it through. He actually found his answer. At Morgan Stanley this is not called vega, it's called kappa. So now, I remember to call it kappa, which is actually a Greek letter. I did that in the last 20 years. So the point I'm trying to tell you is, just bear in mind, this is a field developed in. the last mostly 30 years, or even shorter. So, financial products is really just one form of trading. There are many other ways of trading aside from exchanges. One of them is called OTC, meaning two counterparties agree to do a trade without really subject to the exchange rules, or the underlying trading agreement does not have to be a securitized product, or standardized. The "VaR" concept, or value at risk, is also, obviously, a very important concept. Arbitrage is really to find the relationships between prices, and try to profit from those relationship mispricing. Fundamental analysis, you're really trying to understand what's going on in the world. What is the trade balance of a country? What's the earning potential of a company? What is a policy change? What does it mean when the Federal Reserve announce they're going to taper the quantitative easing? VasILY STRELA: [INAUDIBLE] mentioned that, Apple trades, that now it's $494.4 Yeah, just a couple of [inaUDIBLE]. Well, first of all, no offense to people who were [INAudIBLE], but I just wanted to give an example of [INA UDIBLE]. AUDIENCE: [inaudIBLE]. VASILY STREELA: --because he was working in our group, and it just will give you a little bit of an idea what we will be talking about. what we had, we had the noisy observation of broker data and it was coming out at different non-uniform times. So, we decided to use Kalman filter and to study how it can predict. And that's one of the nice graphs [INAUDIBLE] produced, which again, we will use this strategy and the Kalman filters which he constructed in our e-trading platform in Moscow. Just to remind, the website is fully functional. We will be posting a lot of materials there. Probably most lectures will be published there.

Adam Martin: How do you go from something you're interested in learning about an organism to actually identifying genes and mechanisms that are important for that? Martin: The two heroes of today's lecture will be the roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans, and the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. He also highlights a couple important vertebrate-model organisms-- the zebrafish and the mouse. Martin: Most of them are fairly small, and they're easy to house large numbers of them in a lab. Drosophila larvae has a segmental pattern that alternate between smooth cuticle and hairy cuticle. Because there's a lot of hairlike projections here, it reminded the researchers of a hedgehog. The hedgehog gene was the founding member of an entire signaling pathway, known as the "hedgehog pathway," that plays important roles in human development and also, human cancer. There are now a number of drugs that are being developed to target the hedgehog pathway, and one was approved back in 2012 for use in treating basal-cell carcinoma. Adam Martin: circadian rhythm is a behavior. We are awake during certain parts of the day and are asleep at night. If you're hidden from the light-dark cycle, you continue this cycle for some amount of time. Martin: There's something intrinsic in our system such that we want to exist on this 24-hour wake-sleep cycle. He says the Nobel Prize-winning researchers identified a gene called "period" that is associated with familial advanced-phase syndrome, which is a sleep disorder.

The size of the ribosome is similar to the size of a rhinovirus. There are many features in this part of the sequence that are very important for translation. Exonucleases might end up chewing up your transcript, but that probably suggests that the messenger RNA has been retired and it's going to retire to a better place. And this, once again, plays other functional roles with respect to being recognized as a transcript and helping to get out of the nucleus of the cell. would be degraded. The missense mutations are the more serious ones because you end up with a full length protein that might have a mistake in it. Am I being clear enough to everyone? Yeah? Good. OK, I am going to tell you that I'm handing over the baton to my colleague, Professor Martin. He'll take over on Monday. And these will be the lectures that will occur. I think this field is fascinating. Once you get used to the mechanics of it, it's really cool to think of how you go from DNA to RNA to folded proteins.

The date that's typical for the general phenomenon of colonization coming out of the mother cities of Greece is 750 roughly. The earliest date according to Greek tradition, if my memory is correct, was something like 773 where the Greeks date the foundation of what they thought was the earliest colony they ever established -- a place that they called Pithaecusa, which is the island of Ischia. is seen to be a tremendously valuable safety valve to the Americans, first as colonists, and then as independent people. Americans didn't have the kind of terrible class warfare and the terrible warfare within cities that the Europeans had experienced throughout most of their history. I mean, fundamentally, Kansas is a colony in a certain Greek sense, all of these places are. So, that's part of the story of why America had the very lucky early history that it had. And that is the proper introduction to the next topic, which I'll discuss next year. No not--it seems like a year, but it's next Tuesday actually.

Sir Gawain, nephew of King Arthur, was invited to a party at Camelot. A towering knight riding an emerald steed burst into the room and proposed a game. The Green Knight declared he would allow the bravest warrior present to attack him with his own axe. If they could strike him down, they would win his powerful weapon. However, the knight would be allowed to return that blow in one year and one day. Gawain tried to forget this bizarre vision, but despite the strangeness of the knight’s game, he was determined to act honorably.

At the very end of uh last lecture we were talking about key value stores and uh the cool thing about keyvalue stores is they're very simple in interface excuse me. actually investigated if you were to build uh that factoring algorithm and you could do it as quantum circuits that could run on a quantum computer what would that look like. We actually investigated ways of optimizing that and we could actually look at performance of different options for the shortest factoring algorithms. So we built a cad tool to do that so i i don't know i think it's a pretty interesting area right now and there's a lot of interest in it all right so um sorry i kept you guys way over but this is the last lecture i figured if anybody was interested we talked about key value stores.

Summary:
So in the next portion of today's lecture we're going to talk about how we can modify the policy gradient calculation to reduce its variance. In this way we'll obtain a version of the policy gradients that can be used as a practical reinforcement learning algorithm. The first trick that we'll start with is going to exploit a property that is always true in our universe which is causality causality says that the policy at time t prime can't affect the reward at another time step t if t is less than t prime. variance we just uh sorry we often don't use the optimal baseline we typically just use the expected reward but if you want the optimal baseline this is how you would get it all right so to review what we've covered so far we talked about the high variance of policy gradients algorithms. We talked about how we can lower that variance by exploiting the fact that present actions don't affect past rewards and we talked about how we can use baselines which are also unbiased.

Today we're gonna talk about learning in the setting of games. What does learning mean? How do we learn those evaluation functions that we talked about? And then, er, towards the end of the lecture, we wanna talk a little [NOISE] bit about variations of the game- the games we have talked about. So, uh, how about if you have- how about the cases where we have simultaneous games or non-zero-sum games? And an example of that is rock, paper, scissors. Can you still be optimal if you reveal your strategy? can actually, like, roll two dice and based on the outcome of your dice, you move your pieces various, various amounts to. Uh, there are a bunch of rules. So your goal is to get all your pieces off the board. But if you have only one piece and your opponent gets on top of you, they can push you to the bar and you have to start again. So, so what are some features that you think might be useful? Remember the learning lecture? Yes. Minimax sca- strategy seemed to be pretty okay when it comes to solving these turn-based games. But not all games are turn- based, right? Like an example of it is rock-paper-scissors. You're all playing at the same time, everyone is playing simultaneously. The question is, how do we go about solving simultaneously, okay? So let's start with, um, a game that is a simplified version of rock- Paper-Scissors. This is called a two-finger Morra game. The key idea here is revealing your optimal mixed strategy does not hurt you which is kind of a cool idea. The proof of that is interesting. If you're interested in looking at the notes, you can use linear programming here. So next 10 minutes, I want to spend a little bit of time talking about non-zero-sum games. In real life, you're kind of somewhere in between zero-sum and collaborative games. So, let's motivate that by this idea of Prisoner's dilemma.

Summary:
The famous example was posed by Comte de Buffon back in the 18th century. It marks the beginning of a subject that is known as the subject of geometric probability. The problem is pretty simple. We take a needle that has a certain length-- l-- and we throw it at random on the plane. The needle might fall this way, so that it doesn't cross any line, or it might fall that way, and it ends up crossing one of the lines. If the needle is long enough, it might actually end up crossing two of the Lines. unit cube. So you throw points. Some fault inside. Some fall outside. You count the frequency with which the points happen to be inside your set. And as long as you're throwing the points uniformly over the cube, then the probability of your complicated set is going to be the volume of that set. You estimate the probability by counting the frequencies with which you get points in that set, and so, by using these observed frequencies, you can estimate the volume. It turns out that these days, physicists and many engineers use methods of this kind quite often and in many important applications.

Professor: We're describing interaction between the electromagnetic field and atoms. He says the problem of resonance can be "fixed" by adding an imaginary part to the energy level. Professor: I want to show you what are the tools to treat those infinity source divergences in a consistent and a systematic way. He explains how to calculate the Fourier transform of the time evolution operator to infinite orders, and how to sum up an infinite number of diagrammatic tricks and summation. The course is part of MIT OpenCourseWare, which offers free online classes. Fermi's golden rule is based on the idea of a real and imaginary part. The real part is this matrix element squared, but double sum. And the imaginary part has actually-- remember when we discussed the AC Stark shift. And such AC Stark shifts which appear as self energies, as energy shifts created by the state, this is nothing else than the famous Lamb shift. So what we've got now is a solution for the Fourier transform of the time evolution operator, which initially had a divergence.

David KAISER: Today, we're going to pick up where we were on the most recent classes. We'll look at the coalescence of what came to be called the Big Bang model. And then we'll see how cosmic inflation emerged from that particular moment to try to address some of the shortcomings while retaining some the successes. And the asterisks are to remind you there's a set of strictly optional lecture notes on the Canvas site which go into a little bit more detail of some of these parts from the lecture. 20 years later, two radial physicists working at Bell Labs, Robert Wilson and Arno Penzias, were using a new horn antenna sensitive to radial microwave and radial band frequencies. This should've been among the most precise instruments available on the planet for that band of the spectrum. And they couldn't get rid of a residual hum. This residual hum in your receiver consistent with an energy of about three degrees above zero, three degrees Kelvin, was really the leftover photons, that remnant hot radiation from the Big Bang. The universe should've been filled with light, originally a very high energy. The energy of that light should be falling as the container expands, so as the average energy inside that balloon goes down. So we're basically just moving through a bath of light. The photons aren't coming from that direction of sky the way we think of with point-like sources. There's a galaxy there, a quasar, a particular bright star in our neighborhood. And it's like sitting in a bathtub full of these photons. And all that's changing is their average temperature per photon. why the universe is so messy is actually because Alan's been generating the mess in his own office, and it's expanded to cosmic scales. So if you want to study that part of today's lecture, it's probably the most important lesson, you'll ever take away. And I'll be glad to stay a bit longer if people have questions. Again, I'm sorry for running late. Feel free to drop off if you need. Any questions on that? The photos in Alan's office are on Canvas.

The Peloponnesian War was fought in 431 BC. After the war, Spartan power had grown to an unprecedented degree. For the first time there were lots of Spartans, who had lots of money. The Spartans had choices that they could take. They could either stay in the Pelop onnesus, or they could contest it in their power to control the entire Greek world in the east. Or they could have some control of the Aegean and the Hellespont. The Thirty were deposed by the 3,000, the successor government to the Thirty. They appealed to Sparta for help against this democratic army that Thrasybulus had put out. Sparta did not try to obliterate that army, or as we shall see, treat them as very serious enemies. They worked out an agreement whereby a moderate group of ten Athens would be chosen and a commission sent from Sparta to sit with these Athenians. There would be an amnesty for anybody who were now the losing side.

We are now using the coherent states to look at any other quantum state of the electromagnetic field, any statistical operator which describes photons by forming the diagram matrix element of the statistical operator with alpha. And now we realize that coherent states are not as wonderful as I believe.

We then go into some geometric signal Theory with Transformers and finally how how we can kind of generate sounds using these. The next thing we're going to kind oftalk about is changing forms. We'll talk about the SARS ADC algorithm and how it's used to convert digital signals to analog. are the original Pachelbel's Canon um as you can see this does deviate a bit but honestly it sounds pretty good. The Transformer model is able to do this next note next sequence prediction pretty pretty well.

Professor: The amygdala is closely connected to the basal forebrain. Professor: The abnormal brain connections that we know occur, at least many types of schizophrenia. He says the earlier the lesion, the greater the plasticity, the more chances of sprouting the connections that are the basis for this idea. In green, there are the very widespread catechol-oligosynaptic projections, which show the extent of the brain's plasticity. In blue, the acetylcholine containing neurons that you see in the medial septum, which we mentioned last time. Early in evolution, there was no dorsal striatum. It was a link between the olfactory, [INAUDIBLE],, and motor control. And we also know the outputs of that region go to hypothalamus and subthalamus. They influence the endocrine system and motivational states by these projections. They also have some connections in the midbrain, where they can influence the stacking patterns, especially locomotion. If the prefrontal cortex is functioning abnormally because of sprouting of these axons, then binding to the receptors will move it more towards the normal.

Learn about the duality of light, or how to think about light as a particle, or alternatively, as a quantified particle. Use the weekly Newsquiz to test your knowledge of stories you saw on MIT OpenCourseWare. by some sort of scattering intensity within the medium-- and this sigma here can refer to a variety of processes. If we increase the total thickness, we're going to decrease the total amount of light coming through via that exponential function. The alpha, obviously, is going to be very different for our atmosphere than it was for these little polyethylene sheets. Because the nature of the scattering and absorption processes are very different. for the atmosphere than for here, the density of the material and so forth. We're going to look at two different materials, silicon and gallium arsenide. We'll calculate the thickness necessary to absorb 90% of the incoming light at 550 nanometers. Most of these solar cells that you see of crystalline silicon are on the order of 100 microns, a little thicker. But for technological reasons, which we'll get to, you need about that thickness to absorb a lot of light. And I'll pass around some of the materials right here so you can get a sense of how thick they are.

Summary:
JACK HARE: Let's do a little recap on electron cyclotron emission. We expect to have multiple different peaks, even from a single particle. These peaks are going to be occurring at frequencies. And we can say this is m equals 1, m equals 2,. m equals 3. And they're evenly spaced. And so, we have these peaks here. But if we neglect that, the frequency depends only on the magnetic field. So, if you see some emission at some certain frequency, then you know that it's been emitted by a region of plasma which has this magnetic fields. The idea here is that there was some region over which, in the transverse direction perpendicular to your collection volume, you have a very narrow scale. You can actually collect from a very small region on the order of 100 microns. And if it collimated that beam, that would mean there'd be a focus point at some distance f away-- if this lens has a focal length f, then it will diverge afterwards. So, because of reciprocity, that means that, as opposed to launching rays this way and seeing where they focus, we have rays coming from this. The technique is incredibly powerful because it's enabled people to measure, again, delta on the order of 1%. Someone called it nominative determinism, and they've done it on 1%. And it's used in a variety of applications, but this is an example of what these angle brackets are doing. There are actually lots of different ways of doing this, but there are a few different ways to do correlations, and I'm not going to go into them, but I will give you a citation at the moment. Bremsstrahlung is an isotropic radiation. It emits photons as it's deflected from its trajectory. There are lots of different ways to deal with the radiation. All give the same answer with just a very slightly different coefficient. So it's not really a big difference if you design your reactor. But, from the point of view of this course, it makes no difference. So, again, if you want the full treatment, go have a look in Hutchinson. where we have a range of different discrete energy levels that the electrons can occupy. These energy levels are labeled by the principal quantum number n. And the energies of these levels are given by this unit, Ry, which is the Rydberg z squared of our ion over n squared. Up here, infinity, this is ionization. If your electron gets this much energy, it becomes free again. And so, what we're going to see in our spectrum is that this is only allowed if the electron energy fulfills this equation.

So what we're gonna do today is, sort of, um, build up for Markov Processes, up to Markov Decision Processes. And this build, I think, is sort of a nice one because it allows one to think about what happens in the cases where you might not have control over the world.

Professor: If you have two energy for every system except for every energy except for 0, you have a problem. You know the problem, if you can uniquely characterize the states of the system, then you can learn more about the physics of this state, he says, and you can also know more about physics of a circle.

In order to do that, I basically have to do the integral. So here it is. We have psi of x and t. It's integral dk phi of k e to the ikx minus omega of kt. If you want to see the distortion, you have to keep that [INAUDIBLE]. We'll do that in a week from now. And then, you say, look. There's lots of things making it look like a difficult integral, but it's not as difficult as it looks.

There are three common uses of a rotation matrix. The first is to represent an orientation. The second is to change the frame of reference of a vector. And the third is to rotate a vector or frame. To demonstrate these, I will use these three coordinate frames, representing the same space with different orientations. To help you visualize these frames in 3 dimensions, I'll use my handy tinkertoy frame. In the next video, we will learn how to represent the angular velocity of a frame.

Summary:
Coded imaging is a co-design between how you capture the image and how you process the image. The concept of a position or superposition applies to all three types, shadows- or refraction- or reflection-based techniques. We'll see how-- we already have some projects that are inspired by biological vision. And we'll see it in a taxi zipping very fast, which is a clever way to take a photo. And I believe Santiago-- where's Santiago? Oh, yeah, his triangle-- the piston. The problem is that when you use a box function to take a photo, some of the lower frequencies are actually being set to 0. The culprit here is really this box function, which is equivalent to-- when you release the shutter, opening the-- release your shutter button-- opening the shutter and keeping it open for exposure duration and closing it. So what if you change that? What if you open and close it in a carefully chosen binary sequence? So for some time, the shutter was open, then shutter's closed. It's open for sometime. Again, it's closed, open for quite some time. And so on. So at the end, you still get just one photo. But now something magical has happened because first of all, if you look at this number one, you'll see that it's not the same as before. It seems to have these replicas. Ramesh Raskar: Compressed sensing is taking a photo and compressing it. He says the idea is to take a single photo and then recover it in a compressed way. Rasksar: If you're on 2 megapixels, then you need to take 2 million [? pics] All right? So the claim this group made at Rice University was that if I wanted a million-pixel image, I don't have to really take a million readings, he says. Rasa: I can take this picture effectively with just 10,000 pixels but recreate a million pixel image.

Prof. Clark: Middle class was a form of self-identity that was constructed in the way being a worker was constructed, or being a noble. When you see Daumier or you see Delacroix's famous, Liberty Leading the People, and you see the bourgeois, there with his top hat, he's dressed in a bourgeois uniform like this. That emerges out of the bourgeois century. The middle classes started dressing like this in the nineteenth century, dark with a little bit of color. Once we've got an increase in the wealth of the middle classes, then you wanted the political power. times, as you know, in the French Revolution--;the French revolutions, and in the revolutions of 1848. These folks are here, too. This is your basic petty bourgeoisie. People are always dumping all over them needlessly. If you've ever read the great French novelist--;he was paid by the word, but Balzac is really the novelist of the bourgeoisie. When he describes Paris and the seventeen to nineteen percent of the population who are increasingly living in the western part of Paris, he describes it as a jungle.

Scientists say it would have caused a tsunami at least 800 M High to tear across the Atlantic Ocean. The asteroid that's believed to have wiped them out 66 million years ago was not the only one researchers have confirmed. The discovery is exciting that it happens to be potentially close to the same time as the chicku event known to be the the main cause of the extinction event that killed the dinosaurs.

Summary:
Andrej Karpathy: In this module, I'm going to briefly introduce the idea of differentiable programming. Differentiable programming is closely related to deep learning. It allows you to build up an increasingly more sophisticated model without losing track of what's going on. So let's suppose you want to do image classification. We need some way of representing images. To fix this problem, we introduce convolutional neural networks which is a refinement of fully connected neural networks. So here is an example of ConvNet in action. In NLP, words are discrete objects and neural networks speak vectors. So whenever you're doing NLP with neural nets, you first have to embed words, or more generally, tokens. So we're going to define an EmbedToken function that takes a word or a token x and maps it into a vector. And all this function is going to do is it's going to look up vector in a dictionary that has a static set of vectors associated with particular tokens. But the meaning of the words and tokens depends on context. So this representation of the sentence is not going to be a particularly sophisticated one. A simple RNN works like this: I take a hidden state, multiply by a matrix, take the input and multiply by the matrix. And then I add these two and I apply an activation function. LSTMs, or long short term memory, were developed to solve this problem. So now we have our sequenced model on RNN which produces a sequence of vectors, and the number of vectors depends on how long the input sequence is. So suppose we want to do classification, we need to somehow collapse that into a single vector. And the core part of a transformer is the attention mechanism.

NORVIN RICHARDS: Today is phonetics, which means that today we begin making funny sounds at each other. One standard way of talking about different kinds of speech sounds is to talk about where in the vocal tract the flow of air can get obstructed. So for example, there are what are called bilabial sounds. These are sounds which are made with both lips. And so that's what you do for the sounds that are at the beginnings of words like "paint" and "bath," and "mouth," and well, "wipe" this exercise next time. As we go along, I'm going to be asking you to read things in IPA. So I'll start putting IPA on the slides more and more. So start trying to familiarize yourself with it and get to where you're familiar with at least the symbols for sounds that we use in English. Do you want me to read the rest of them? I'll do some more IPA. OK, so what's the second one? STUDENT: "Sue says he's a bad egg."

Expectation is a basic question that will come up again and again when we look at random variables and probability theory. We're imagining n independent flips of a coin with bias p. The probability of heads is p. It would be biased in favor of heads if p is greater than 1/2. And we want to know how many heads are expected. So what's the expected number of heads? Well, we already know-- we've examined the binomial distribution B n,p.

Aristotle was born 384,15 years after the trial of Socrates. He was sent by his father to go to college. Unlike most of you, Aristotle did not spend four years at the Platonic Academy. He remained attached to it for the next 20, until the death of Plato. Unlike his intellectual godfather, Socrates, who wrote nothing but conversed endlessly, Aristotle wrote disciplined and thematic treatises on virtually every topic. He collected constitutions, 158 of them in all, from throughout the ancient world.

Mathematically, a consumer is trying to maximize his utility. And this utility maximization has to be done with respect to some constraint and the constraint the budget constraint we take P 1 x 1; P 2 x 2 should be less than or equal to I. In real life, it is possible that a person derives some satisfaction from having some money left in his pocket, but the way this problem has been framed here the person’s satisfaction depends only on his level of consumption of good 1, and good 2.

The Rolex Center is such an iconic building that it also serve a kind of a prestige function, to put the institution on the map in terms of it's a statement. We have a student center here at MIT. People go there to do their banking, their eating, their meeting, and so forth. So we could spend a lot of time on these, but really crisply refining and thinking about the concept is very, very important. So let me very quickly go through the refrigerator case study to show how do we transition from concept to design. When you think about a refrigerator, it's really about preserving food or reducing the spoilage rate of the food. So beside chilling or keeping the food cold, we could irradiate the food or dry it. The key idea is start thinking in this abstract way, and all of a sudden all of these other possibilities become possible. EPFL's Olivier De WECK: Food is pretty essential for humans, this is one of the areas where humans have been very creative. There's a lot of ways to do this. of thinking, these seven principles have been extracted. And then you can say, well, which of these do I feel really resonate with me? All right. Let's move to some of the structured processes for creativity. So the first one is probably the simplest and the one that's used the most. This is known as a morphological matrix. The idea there is that you try to define what are the key features, factors, or decisions that you have to make when you define a concept or an architecture. set. So now be unchained, and within the constraints that are set by the competition, come up with different concepts. And in the homework, what I ask you to do in A3 is try out at least two different techniques, a structured one and an unstructured one and then compare the results. And this will be due in two weeks, and you will have to do it in two hours. And so, in the next two weeks you will be doing your homework.

As you will see in some small examples having this outliers in your optimization problem is something which hurts dramatically which actually screw up your solution. Already a few outliers can lead to a environment model which is completely unusable for doing any navigation task so where the geometry of what you computed doesn't fit to the real world geometry anymore and one of the questions actually how to handle that.

Summary:
John Stuart Mill is the principle expositor of neoclassical utilitarianism. The rights-utility synthesis signals that we're looking for an attempt to put together both a commitment to utilitarian efficiency that's grounded in science on the one hand, and respect for individual rights that's grounding in the workmanship ideal on the other hand. At the same time, more or less, there were very important developments in moral philosophy that I just want to alert you to. The doctrine that I'm mentioning here is the doctrine that would come to be called emotivism. same utility even though they're different indifference curves. Prof: You're on the right track, but what's the problem with their crossing? Student: Because you say I-2 has utility of two, I-3.5 has Utility of two-point-five, but at that point where they intersect they both have to have the same utility. If we're saying that we're indifferent among all the things on this curve we can't have it cross because then we're say here, right, two- point-five is preferred to two. which the radical fangs of classical utilitarianism have been ripped out and it is now a doctrine that is very friendly to whatever status quo happens to be generated in a market system. So it ceases to be this radically redistributive doctrine, and in the process imports into utilitarianism a very robust, some would say, hyper-robust doctrine of individual rights. We'll see how that played out in political theory when we come to look at John Stuart Mills' harm principle next Monday.

Summary:
The best-case scenario for expansionary fiscal policy is when there are lots of underemployed resources in the economy. By increasing spending, the federal government can try to counteract falling aggregate demand. In one scenario, government spending doesn't have to be as large as the fall in "C," or consumption, to counteract the recession, and that's because of the multiplier effect. But, as always, shifting lines on a graph is much easier than shifting around real resources in a multi-trillion dollar economy.

So, in this case, this mouse, the light is shined into its brain, and they're testing a specific type of neuron that is involved in arousal of the mouse. And it's going to wake up right now. There it goes. It woke up. You see now its muscle activity is going, OK?
