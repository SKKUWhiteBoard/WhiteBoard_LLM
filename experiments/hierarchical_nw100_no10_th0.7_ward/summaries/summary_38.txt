This is because buyouts usually result in the separation of employees with higher salaries and benefits than those who are separated through RIFs. Because of the rights of higher graded employees to “bump” or “retreat” to lower-graded positions during a RIF, employees separated are frequently not those who were in the positions originally targeted for elimination. We found that buyouts could generate up to 50 percent more in net savings than Rifs over the 5-year period following separation. such situations, buyouts or RIFs may be necessary. In comparing the costs and savings of buyouts and Rifs, our analysis showed that buyouts offered greater savings than RIF's, except when RIFed employees do not bump and retreat and are eligible to retire. This concludes my prepared statement. I would be pleased to answer any questions you or Members of the Subcommittee may have. The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free. Additional copies are $2 each. non-Department of Defense (DOD) executive branch agencies to pay buyouts to employees who agreed to resign, retire, or take voluntary early retirement by March 31, 1995. DOD, though subject to the act’s governmentwide FTE ceilings, has the authority, under earlier legislation, to offer buyouts through September 30, 1999. For both DOD and non-DOD agencies, the buyout payment was the lesser of $25,000 or an employee's severance pay entitlement. According to OPM data, more than 112,500 buyouts had been paid governmentwide. buyout legislation, the buyouts appeared to have helped agencies downsize without adversely affecting workforce diversity. Of the nearly 83,000 employees who were paid buyouts from fiscal year 1993 through March 31, 1995, 52 percent were white males. The percentage of women in the workforce increased from 43.4 percent at the end of fiscal year 1992 to 44.6 percent by March 1, 1995. Likewise, during that same time period, the percentage of minorities went from 27.9 percent to 28. 9 percent of the workforce. The federal workforce is being reduced at a faster pace than was called for by the Workforce Restructuring Act. The act mandated a ceiling of 2,043,300 FTE positions for fiscal year 1995. By the end of fiscal year 1997, the administration’s budget calls for the federal workforce to be nearly 53,000 positions below the ceiling. DOD absorbed nearly three-quarters of the FTE reductions in fiscal year 1994 and over half of the governmentwide reductions in Fiscal Year 1995. Some agencies may need to pare down their workforces more than others as budgets are reduced, programs are dropped, and/or missions are changed. In such circumstances, some agencies may not be able to meet workforce reduction goals through attrition. Other downsizing strategies, such as buyouts or RIFs, may be necessary. do so 3 years earlier. If it were to reduce at this pace, NASA has said that it not be refilled by government or contractor personnel. Projected savings would be reduced by reducing management control positions. The Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-226) placed annual ceilings on executive branch full-time equivalent (FTE) positions from fiscal years 1994 through 1999. To help accomplish this downsizing, the act allowed non-Department of Defense (DOD) executive branch agencies to pay buyouts in fiscal year 1995. In fiscal year 1997, DOD is expected to absorb all of the FTE reductions made that year while the non-DOD workforce is expectedto increase by a net total of 0.2 percent. From September 30, 1994, through March 1995, the on-board executive branch civilian workforce dropped from 2,164,727 employees to 2,032,440 employees. CPDF data show that of the 132,287 reductions, 48 percent involved buyouts and 6 percent came from RIFs. The remaining 46 percent involved separations without buyouts or the basis for separation was not identified in the CPDF. The administration, through NPR, recommended that agencies direct their workforce reductions at specific “management control” positions that the administration said added little. attrition, and the cost and savings implications of buyouts versus reductions-in-force (RIF) We obtained information on the results of federal downsizing activities by analyzing workforce data contained in the Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) Central Personnel Data File (CPDF) for fiscal year 1992 through November of fiscal year 1996. Our estimate of the extent to which mandated workforce reduction goals can be achieved by attrition was based on workforce trends in the President's fiscal year 1997 federal budget. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: We are pleased to be here today to discuss the progress being made in downsizing the federal workforce and agencies’ use of buyouts. As agreed with your office, our statement includes information on the results to date of federal downsizing efforts. We estimate that the statutorily mandated workforce reduction goals could be met through attrition, and the cost and savings implications of buy outs versus attrition. We also discuss the demographic results of the buyouts and the extent to which we estimate that they could be achieved through attrition. NASA has said that it would anticipate that RIFs would be necessary. Study finds that, over a 5-year period, buyouts would generally result in more savings to taxpayers. This is because buyouts usually result in the separation of employees. The study was published in the journal of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, which is published by the Association for Aeronautical and Space Studies (AAS). AAS is a nonprofit that promotes aerospace and space exploration in the United States. The percentage of supervisors at DOD agencies dipped from 12.7 percent of the workforce to 11.9 percent. All but one of the other designated management control positions increased somewhat. Acquisition positions showed no change. Non-DOD agencies came only slightly closer to meeting the NPR goals. Some employees delayed their separations so that they could receive a buyout. Although it was not an explicit goal of the buyout legislation, the buyouts appeared to have helped agencies downsize. Some positions showed a proportional reduction or slight increases. specific “management control” positions that the administration said added little value to serving taxpayers. Such positions included those held by (1) managers and supervisors and (2) employees in headquarters, personnel, budget, procurement, and accounting occupations. By fiscal year 1999, the administration called on agencies to increase managers’ and supervisors’ span of control over other employees from a ratio of 1:7 to 1:15. In our draft report on agencies’ use of buyouts that we are preparing for this Subcommittee, we present preliminary data showing that, as a proportion of the workforce as a whole, management control positions have been cut by half.
