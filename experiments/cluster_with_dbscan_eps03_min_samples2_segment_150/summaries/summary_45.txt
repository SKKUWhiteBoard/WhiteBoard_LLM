Iceland is one of the world's most active volcanic hotspots crafer has erupted 30 times in a thousand years and last blue in the 1980s. Scientists are now preparing to drill into it the is to learn more about how volcanoes behave so that we can better predict eruptions and also tap into a super hot source of energy. Residents of grindvik have had their lives appended by a string of eruptions but researchers here hope their work will change that helping to save lives and money. many other locations around the world where we have active volcanoes so this crazy sanding plan may actually have huge potential e.

Scientists are preparing to drill down into a magma chamber starting in 2026 they'll begin work on the first ever underground magma Observatory. The plan is to drill just short of the magma itself possibly poke it a little bit. The geothermal resource which is at just above theMagma body is around 5 to 600Â° C just two ball holes of this kind could match the output of this entire plant. The drilling will be technically challenging at the University of Iceland lab work is underway testing materials to withstand extreme heat.
