The Constitution gives Congress the authority to impeach and remove the President, Vice President, and other federal "civil officers" The House has impeached 19 individuals: 15 federal judges, one Senator, one Cabinet member, and two Presidents. The Senate has conducted 16 full impeachment trials. Conviction of an individual requires a two-thirds majority of the present Senators on one of the articles brought by the House. If the Senate convicts the official of the alleged offenses, the result is removal from office of those still in office.
