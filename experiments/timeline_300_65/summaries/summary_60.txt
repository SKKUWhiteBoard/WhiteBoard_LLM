An independent set in a graph is a subset of vertices with no two adjacent. The proof of this theorem applies the probabilistic method. The expected size of this set I is equal to the sum over vertices V in G of the probability that this V lies in I. This is what happens on average, and therefore, there must be some ordering in the set I, says YUFEI ZHAO. It will be impossible to have two vertices in I that are adjacent to each other. Every n-vertex. graph G contains a clique on at least this many vertices. Turan's theorem gives us some bound on the maximum number of edges that a graph can have if it doesn't have a large clique. When n is not divisible by r, you need to do a similar construction, and this bound can be improved slightly, but not by too much. And this proof that we just saw is a beautiful illustration of probabilistic graph theory that allows us to prove this wonderful result.
