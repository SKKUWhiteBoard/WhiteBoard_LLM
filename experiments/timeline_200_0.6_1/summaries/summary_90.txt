So we're imagining n independent flips of a coin with bias p. So the coins might not be fair. The probability of heads is p. It would be biased in favor of heads if p is greater than 1/2. And we want to know how many heads are expected. This is a basic question that will come up again and again when we look at random variables and probability theory. So what's the expected number of heads? Well, we already know-- we've examined the binomial distribution B n,p. of getting k heads, which we've worked out previously. n choose k times p to the k, 1 minus p toThe n minus k. Well, let's introduce an abbreviation, a standard abbreviation. Let's replace 1minus p by q, where-- so p plus q equals 1, and they're both not negative and between 0 and 1. And when I express the expectation this way, it starts to look like something a little bit familiar. So what I'm going to wind up with is that n is equal to 1/p times the expectation of B n,p.
