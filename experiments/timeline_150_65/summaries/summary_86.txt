Cú Chulainn, hero of Ulster, stood at the ford at Cooley, ready to face an entire army singlehandedly. The army in question belonged to Queen Meadhbh of Connaught. Enraged at her husband’s possession of a white bull of awesome strength, she had set out to capture the fabled brown bull of Ulster at any cost. Unfortunately, the King of Ulster had chosen this moment to force the goddess Macha to race her chariot while pregnant. In retaliation, she struck down him and his entire army with stomach cramps. Cú Chulainn and Ferdiad met in Scotland while training with the renowned warrior Scáthach. When they returned to their respective homes, they found themselves on opposite sides of a war. The Queen was impatient to get her hands on the prize bull, so she goaded him and questioned his honor until he had no choice but to fight. The two faced off at the ford, matching each other exactly in strength and skill no matter what weapons they used. But Cú ChULainn had one last trick up his sleeve: their teacher had shared a secret with him alone. She told him how to summon the Gáe Bulg, a magical. spear fashioned from the bones of sea monsters that lay at the bottom of the ocean. Cu Chulainn called the spear, stabbed Ferdiad to death, and collapsed. Meadhbh seized her chance and swooped in with the rest of her army to capture the brown bull. At last, the men of Ulster were recovering from their magical illness, and they surged out in pursuit. But they were too late: Queen Meadh Bh crossed the border unscathed, dragging the brown Bull with her. broken heart, leaving behind a land that would remain ravaged by Meadhbh’s war for years to come. “I will never forget you,” he wrote to his son. ‘I will always love you.’ “You are my son,’ he replied, “and I will always be your son.” “And I will never leave you, my son. I will forever love you’, he said, ‘even though I’m no longer your son’.
