Under the PPACA MLR requirements, private insurers must report annually to CMS their MLRs by each state and insurance market in which they operate. Each of these components must be reported by state and by market. Insurers are also allowed to include expenses for health information technology required to accomplish. The remaining amount of premiums that an insurer does not spend on the components of claims, taxes and fees, and non-claims costs will be referred to as the insurer’s “premium surplus”
