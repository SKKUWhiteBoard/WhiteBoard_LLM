Chintan: There's a danger that we focus on all of this and on what it can deliver but frankly it needs people that understand it. There is no AI without data without the network to actually connect the you know act as the connective tissue to to the algorithms that are answering our questions and giving us our responses. If you can't secure that end to end then that's where that trust issue really comes into as you mentioned around cyber security. Chintan says we have to train the Next Generation in both these Advanced AI skills but also some of the fundamental essential digital skills that we need you. We're going to focus on the impact of AI on the world workplace and how some are now fighting back around the world and the UK. There's also now a concern that intelligent chatbots could replace roles that have traditionally relied on a more human touch things like customer service or call center center. We're also going to speak to one reporter who's been researching the threat posed to workers and how they are now fight back around world.

Emma: I think we're looking at lower level jobs as a result of AI it's like we're flipping it on its head and maybe we could actually replace CEOs or Executives. were most at risk because of automation. People are realizing you have to throw out the door any ideas you had about who is really at risk and say every job is going to be changed. We just hope that the workers whose jobs are changing have a voice in saying how yeah it's turkeyy is not going to vote for Christmas are they if those are the ones that could find their jobs being replaced but there's so much in there and Stephanie just a final thought from you in all of this about briefly if you will. this and now Emma thank you so much we'll be reading closely uh as your investigations continue uh that is it we're out of time we'll do it at the same time next week bye-bye.
