Most discussions of Russian interests in Iraq focus on economic factors. Moscow has cultivated friendly relations with Baghdad since the 1960s. Russian oil companies have contracts that could be worth as much as $30 billion over 20 years to develop Iraqi oil fields. Russian firms have contractsworth billions to helpmodernize Iraq's economic infrastructure. Russia profits greatly from high oil prices. But Russian leaders fear that a post-Saddam Iraq mightmaximize its oil output, dramatically driving down the price of oil. Russian policy is also motivated by a desire to restrain U.S. global domination.
