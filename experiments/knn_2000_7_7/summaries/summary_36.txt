Professor: The plan for today is as follows. We're going to look at this unitary time evolution and calculate this operator u, given the Hamiltonian. Then we will look at the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics. The Schrodinger operators acquire time dependence, which makes the relation between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics more obvious. So we'll discuss that. We'll find the heisenberg equations of motion and solve them for a particular case today. And we'll go through three cases.
