The key in this is, describe the concept using few words precisely, but to set it apart from neighboring concepts. The first thing you do is understand where is the value-- the stakeholders and the stakeholder analysis and the requirements definition. And then the goals then are an instrument of the primary delivery process, which is your product design. And there is a recipe for doing this system, as a system engineer, as well as an architect.

The key idea is start thinking in this abstract way, and all of a sudden all these other possibilities become possible. Once we have that, we can start managing complexity, decomposing function and form. And then our system object, you can decompose it into different elements, supporting systems, the operand, the operator, and so forth. It's the combination of this specific way you're going to operate the system.
