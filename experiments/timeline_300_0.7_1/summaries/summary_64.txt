Sir Gawain, nephew of King Arthur, was invited to a party at Camelot. A towering knight riding an emerald steed burst into the room and proposed a game. The Green Knight declared he would allow the bravest warrior present to attack him with his own axe. If they could strike him down, they would win his powerful weapon. However, the knight would be allowed to return that blow in one year and one day. In the months that followed, Gawain tried to forget this bizarre vision. But despite the strangeness of the knight’s game, he was determined to act honorably. of Arthur’s knights. He’d planned to spare his neck entirely, until Gawain concealed the sash. Filled with shame, Gawain returned to Camelot. But to his surprise, his companions absolved him of blame and celebrated his valor. Struggling to understand this strange journey, it seemed to Gawain that perhaps the whole world was playing a game. With rules more wild and bewildering than any man could understand, he wondered if the world was a game, too.
