A random variable can take different numerical values depending on the outcome of the experiment. Some outcomes are more likely than others, and similarly some of the possible numerical values of a random variable will be more likely. We will describe these relative likelihoods in terms of the so-called probability mass function, or PMF. The PMF is also sometimes called the probability law or the probability distribution of a discrete random variable. The argument of the PMF ranges over the possible values of the random variable, X. The probability mass function is a function of an argument x. For any x, it specifies the probability that the random variable takes on this particular value. Since the total probability of all outcomes is equal to 1, the probabilities of the different possible values should also add to 1. Let us now go through a simple example to illustrate the general method for calculating the PMF of a discrete random variable. We will revisit our familiar example involving two rolls of the tetrahedral die. And let X be the result of the first roll of the die. roll, Y be the result of the second roll. In order to do any probability calculations, we also need the probability law. We will concentrate on a particular random variable defined to be the sum of the random variables, X and Y. What we want to do now is to calculate the PMF of this random variable. We need to find this value for all choices of z, that is for all possible values in the range of our random variables. And we can continue this way by marking, for each particular outcome, the corresponding value of therandom variable of interest.
