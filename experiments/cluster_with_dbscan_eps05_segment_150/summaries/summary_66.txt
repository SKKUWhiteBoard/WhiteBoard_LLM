I'm sure the TAs would be very happy to help you to force COMsOL to cooperate. All right, so we're going to talk about partial differential equations. And, as it sounds, what's different about a partial differential equation is, it has partial derivatives in it. set up is right, so you can use it. But if you can, it can be pretty good. All right.

The next time I'll be lecturing to you will be a week from Friday. The homework following the quiz will be posted and so you guys can get started on that. That homework involves a COMSOL speed of sound. They won't catch up to the shock. So they will have no effect whatsoever.
