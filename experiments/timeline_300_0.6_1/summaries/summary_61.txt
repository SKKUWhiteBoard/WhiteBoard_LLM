The size of the ribosome is similar to the size of a rhinovirus. There are many features in this part of the sequence that are very important for translation. Exonucleases might end up chewing up your transcript, but that probably suggests that the messenger RNA has been retired and it's going to retire to a better place. And this, once again, plays other functional roles with respect to being recognized as a transcript and helping to get out of the nucleus of the cell. fix errors is editing when you've loaded the wrong amino acid onto a tRNA. But what happens when the DNA message, the DNA starting point, is wrong, which means the messenger is wrong? So I'm just going to give you a couple of terms here. The first type of error is a nonsense mutation, which might be leaving out a base pair, inserting one, substituting one. And this would, ultimately, cause an error in the DNA. Then the last ones are the ones where we start to encounter errors in DNA. "I think this field is fascinating. Once you get used to the mechanics of it, it's really cool to think of how you go from DNA to RNA to folded proteins," he says. "Don't forget my office hours on Monday if you need them," he adds. "I'll be in the lab all day, every day, if you want to talk to me about it." "I've got a lot of questions for you," she says, "but I'll be happy to answer them."
