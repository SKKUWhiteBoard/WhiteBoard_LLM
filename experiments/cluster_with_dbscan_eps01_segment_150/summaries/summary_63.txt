feasible here, y is taking care of not only inputs but also output. The combination is all given here and this exhibits convexity. This is a simple example of how to make a complex shape. The shape can be any shape at any time. It can be either a shape or a shape-shift shape. It is possible to combine two shapes to create a shape that looks like a shape shape. For example, the shape could look like the shape of a circle or a circle. If certain amount of output can be produced by given amount of inputs, then the same combination of input puts can also be used to produce less. The key word is feasibility technology. So, if it is feasible to produce half kg of curd from 1 kg of milk, then it is possible to produce 250 grams of curD from 1kg of milk. The second is no free lunch. At least 1 input is required to produce some output, or more than you know more than 1 kind of output. Third is non reversibility, what it means is that a production process cannot be reversed.
