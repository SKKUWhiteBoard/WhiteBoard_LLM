In this lecture, we're going to talk about how neurons function and how researchers are able to control that function in order to modify behavior. Then we'll talk about synapses and how synapses function to communicate between neurons. And this is going to involve also sort of understanding how certain antidepressants, like Prozac, work. And then we'll end by talking about how researchers did this experiment to wake up the mouse. And it all starts with something that I told you about at the beginning of the semester, which is the plasma membrane. In a resting state, the cell's resting potential is negative 70 millivolts. The cell can lose this polarity and not have a charge differential, or it can flip and be positive on the inside. Stephen suggested opening ion channels. If you open these, it's going to depolarize the cell. Because remember, high on the outside, out here. And so if you open them, positive ions are going to flow in to make this less positive. So what is an action potential? Everyone see how it's a transient potential. you to test the function of the neuron in the behavior of an organism. So, in this case, this mouse, the light is shined into its brain, and they're testing a specific type of neuron that is involved in arousal of the mouse. And it's going to wake up right now. There it goes. It woke up. You see now its muscle activity is going, OK? So you can test thefunction of specific nerve cells using this approach, and it's because you have a light-sensitive sodium channel.
