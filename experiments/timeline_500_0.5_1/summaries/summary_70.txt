Professor: We're describing interaction between the electromagnetic field and atoms. He says the problem of resonance can be "fixed" by adding an imaginary part to the energy level. Professor: I want to show you what are the tools to treat those infinity source divergences in a consistent and a systematic way. He explains how to calculate the Fourier transform of the time evolution operator to infinite orders, and how to sum up an infinite number of diagrammatic tricks and summation. The course is part of MIT OpenCourseWare, which offers free online classes. Fermi's golden rule is based on the idea of a real and imaginary part. The real part is this matrix element squared, but double sum. And the imaginary part has actually-- remember when we discussed the AC Stark shift. And such AC Stark shifts which appear as self energies, as energy shifts created by the state, this is nothing else than the famous Lamb shift. So what we've got now is a solution for the Fourier transform of the time evolution operator, which initially had a divergence.
