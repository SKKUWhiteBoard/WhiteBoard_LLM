In this lecture, we're going to talk about how neurons function and how researchers are able to control that function in order to modify behavior. Then we'll talk about synapses and how synapses function to communicate between neurons. And this is going to involve also sort of understanding how certain antidepressants, like Prozac, work. And then we'll end by talking about how researchers did this experiment to wake up the mouse. And it all starts with something that I told you about at the beginning of the semester, which is the plasma membrane. In a resting state, the cell's resting potential is negative 70 millivolts. The cell can lose this polarity and not have a charge differential, or it can flip and be positive on the inside. Stephen suggested opening ion channels. If you open these, it's going to depolarize the cell. Because remember, high on the outside, out here. And so if you open them, positive ions are going to flow in to make this less positive. So what is an action potential? Everyone see how it's a transient potential. optogenetics is an approach to control the activity of a cell with light. In a normal neuron, you need a neurotransmitter to induce depolarization. optogenetics uses a protein discovered from photosynthetic algae that's responsive to light. And if that's expressed specifically in the neurons that you're trying to test, you can then shine a light into the brain of the organism and activate, specifically, this type of neuron. And that allows you to test the function of the neuron in the behavior of an organism.
