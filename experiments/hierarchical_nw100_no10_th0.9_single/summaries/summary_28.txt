Concessions include food operations, vending machines, retail shops, public pay telephones, barber/beauty shops, transportation, lodging, marinas, and campgrounds. We excluded day care centers, employee association stores, and services provided by visually impaired persons under the Randolph-Sheppard Act. Most agreements provide that the concessioner will pay the government either a flat fee or a percentage of gross revenues. Each agency is responsible for developing, implementing, and monitoring its concessions program to ensure that the federal government receives a fair return.
