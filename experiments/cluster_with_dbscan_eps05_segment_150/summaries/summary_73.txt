The goal is to understand solar cell conversion efficiency, which is the ratio of output to input energy. For most solar cells, this breaks down to the following progression, from the solar spectrum to charge collection. We're going to be focusing on charge separation, incorporating elements of either side. The total system efficiency is the product of each individual component going on in a solar cell. The energy band diagram for pn-junction in the dark is the equivalent circuit diagram for the diode under illumination.
