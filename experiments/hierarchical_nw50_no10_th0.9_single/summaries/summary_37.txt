From fiscal year 1991 through fiscal year 2022, the Army plans to purchase 85,488 FMTV trucks to replace its aging medium truck fleet. The FMTV acquisition strategy has two phasesâ€”prototype and production. The Army did not execute a low-risk acquisition strategy. In our November 1998 report, we found that the Army had not (1) instituted safeguards to ensure that existing production problems did not occur in follow-on production contracts and (2) performed a cost and benefit analysis of its plan to develop the trucks.
