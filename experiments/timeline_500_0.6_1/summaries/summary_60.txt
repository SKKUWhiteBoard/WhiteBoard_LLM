In this chapter we will discuss two applications, one price control and second taxation, so right. Sir, does this slope of this graph denote anything price demand upon, some price upon some quantity? So, wait little later we will talk about that that topic, right now we are just talking about movement and shifts, the direction of movement. We are not talking about the slope. So, what is price control what do we mean by price control? Price control is how we can regulate the prices of the goods in the market. The farmers like people who are putting in more effort, but not getting the proper returns of their effort that is why. It is to incentivize the production for a few like for wheat or if we talk if there is a new production of potato and if we put price floor on potato. So, it will incentivize production and they can serve the market better. But even when we have proper distribution, why cannot government buy these the items that government needs to provide to poor at the market price and give it to poorest, just a point that you should ponder.
