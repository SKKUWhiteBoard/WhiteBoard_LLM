In recent years, observers have suggested that United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) is generally more effective at acquisitions than the U.S. military departments. This report describes SOCOM's acquisition authorities for unclassified acquisition programs and compares these authorities to those granted to the military department. It also compares the military departments' and SOCom's chains of command, and the scope of acquisition activity and program oversight for those organizations. Finally, the report explores whether SOCOM has unique characteristics that influence how it conducts acquisition.
