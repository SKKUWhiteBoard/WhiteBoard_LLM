When a particle's undergoing circular motion, it has a velocity that you can describe, which is the tangential motion around the circle. And it also has an angular velocity, which we define as being in a direction that's perpendicular to that direction of rotation. Let's now look at rotation in an arbitrary plane. So if I have a plane like this and I have some particle traveling in a circle like this, then it will see this rotation with these directions. So we can define d theta dt to be the component of the angular velocity omega z. as being in the counterclockwise direction. Whereas if I have another observer down here and they're looking up at this plane, they'll see the motion as being clock wise. And so you can see we have a need for a more formal definition for the rotation of this. So what we're going to do is use the right hand rule to define a direction that tells you both the direction it defines the plane and it also tells you what the positive direction of rotation is for that plane. it's the normal unit vector to that plane. In our other case, for d theta dt less than zero, our particle is traveling in this direction. And so you can see by my right hand rule that now the direction that I've defined is into the board. And for that, I'm going to draw this as an x in the circle. All right. Let's come back to this example now, where the plane of the motion is this plane ofthe board. So now, let's look back at our coordinate system that we've defined. We have r hat direction and a theta hat direction. And in this coordinate system, there's a third direction that's defined, which is the k hat direction, which you can see is out of the board. And so now, I'm going to define what we actually call the angular velocity as omega. And I'mgoing to write that as d theta dt. Now, in the kHat direction, in this case, it could be in an arbitrary n hat direction,. depending on what you're playing of motion is.
