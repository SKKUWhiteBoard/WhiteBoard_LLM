Bolek Wyslouch: How do you convert a given physical system with all the forces, et cetera, into some sort of fixed form, fixed type of notation? Bolek: We will work on two, again, simple physical systems, one that consists of two pendula driven by forces of gravity, each of them. And we will discuss various interesting-- even though the system is very simple, just two masses, a spring, a little bit of gravity on top of that. Complex notation is a mathematical answer, how to solve a mathematical equation. But the physics answer is to find fixed frequency modes us such that the system, the complete system, oscillates at one frequency. This is so-called normal mode. So I propose that-- so of course, we use the usual trick that anytime we have a solution in complex variables, we can always get back to real things by taking a real part. But what form of oscillation? OK, all kinds of complex numbers can write, but any particular-- could put it with me some spaceship, and go to a place where the gravity is different, right? Why not? So what would happen? So if gravity changes, then basically what will happen is both this term and that term will change. So let's try to see what happens on the Moon. It's a little bit not completely clear what's going on, but you see, actually the motion is kind of a little strange. Look at the red one. The red one is stopping. Then it's going halfway out. It looks kind of messy, doesn't it?
