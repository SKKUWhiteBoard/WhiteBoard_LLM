PPACA requires that private insurers offering group or individual health insurance coverage report annually on the various components that are used to calculate their MLRs. Private insurers first reported this information in 2012, based on their 2011 experience. The MLR data that insurers report to CMS include the following components, as required by law: Medical claims, expenses for quality improvement (QI) activities, non-claims costs, taxes and fees, and community benefit expenditures. The remaining amount of premiums that an insurer does not spend on the components of medical claims, QI activities, and non- claims costs, will be referred to as the insurer’s “premium surplus” Insurers’ spending on QI expenses did not vary across markets. Insurers in the small group market spent a higher share on agents’ and brokers’ fees and commissions than insurers in the individual and large group markets. In 2012 small group insurers spent about 42 percent of their total non-claims costs on agents' and brokers' fees and commission compared to the 23 percent that large group insurers spend. In 2011 and 2012, insurers paid about $1.1 billion in total rebates to enrollees and policyholders who paid premiums. rebates in 2012. These amounts would each have decreased by about 75 percent had agents’ and brokers’ fees and commissions been excluded from the MLR and rebate calculations. Of the $1.1 billion in total rebates that insurers paid in 2011, insurers in the large group market paid 37 percent of this total, or $405 million in rebates. In 2012, the largest amount was paid in the small group market (about $207 million) These rebate calculations are based on the assumption that insurers did not make other changes during this time that would have affected their MLRs. MLR requirements were one factor among a variety of factors that influenced their decisions regarding premium rates. Two of these insurers told us that the MLR requirements have generally moderated their premium increases. All eight insurers we interviewed told us the PPACA MLr requirements have not affected where they do business and have had no effect, or a very limited effect, on their spending on QI activities since 2011. Five of the eight insurers also commented that the 2013 PP ACA MLR calculation, which is based on a 3-year period including 2013 and the prior 2 years, will likely reduce some of the effects of year-to-year variability. One insurer, who paid rebates in 2011, noted that it would not have owed rebates had the MLR formula been based on 3 years of insurers’ experience. Another insurer told us that it will likely owe rebates for 2013 because MLR data it reported in 2011 and 2012 will be averaged into 2013. The insurer added that over time, however, it believes the 3-yearMLR formula should be beneficial for the insurer by reducing its rebates over the next 3 years. the likelihood of owing rebates.

This appendix presents information on insurers’ median PPACA medical loss ratios by state and insurance market for 2011 (see table 6) and for 2012 (see tables 7 and 8) This appendix gives information on insurer’ spending as a percent of their net premiums, by state for all markets combined for 2011 and 2012. The appendix also shows the total amount of PPACA rebates that insurers paid to enrollees and policyholders who paid premiums.  appendix presents information on the amount of rebates that insurers would have paid to enrollees and policyholders who paid premiums with agents’ and brokers’ commissions and fees excluded from the PPACA medical loss ratio and rebate calculations.
