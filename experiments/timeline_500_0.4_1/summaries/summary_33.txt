Markus Klute: If there is a time dilation effect due to gravitational fields, then there's also a redshift which is of gravitational fields. He asks you to estimate the magnitude of this effect. Klute says the speed of light is pretty fast, 3 times 10 to the 9 meter per second. And this distance is only 22 and 1/2 meters, so we find that this is a tiny, tiny,tiny effect, he says. But nevertheless, experimentalists at Harvard tested this effect in the 1950s and '60s.
