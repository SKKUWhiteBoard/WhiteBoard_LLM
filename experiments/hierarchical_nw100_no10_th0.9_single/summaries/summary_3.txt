TPPs prepare teaching candidates to employ effective teaching techniques and gain real-world experience in the classroom. States have discretion in how they conduct oversight of TPP quality. Education does not have direct oversight authority over TPPs. Title II of the awarding and administering several competitive grants provides funding for reforms to the TPP system. In September 2014, 24 districts received $35 million in grants to improve teacher preparation for science, technology, engineering, and math teachers, including the Race to the Top Fund, Investing in Effective Educator Development Fund, and Supporting the Transition to Teaching grant program.
