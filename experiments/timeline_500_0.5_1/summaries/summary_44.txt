Hollywood Legend Will Smith owns a team in the new E1 racing series that aims to prove the potential of electric power in the Marine industry. The nine teams have the same boat but they're working out how to push the tech and try to get ahead of the competition. The boats can reach 50 knots that's around 93 km per hour so how do they reach those speeds? The key bit here is getting up on the thin bits of the foil and staying above the water to have the speed that's right. attracted some big name investors despite only being in his first year. There are challenges ahead can it keep those celebrity backers and can it build a big audience for this high-tech reing. I think the ground workor for this Championship is amazing you know the names behind it now are incredible. I've heard some good rumors of teams coming in for next year as well so I Think the format is really exciting I think a lot of people are really interested in excited about the new technology and also the sustainability message.
