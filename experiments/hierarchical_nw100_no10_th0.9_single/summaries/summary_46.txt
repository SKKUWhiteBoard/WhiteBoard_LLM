The 1986 amendments to RCRA established the LUST Trust Fund to finance the cleanup of petroleum releases from underground storage tanks. Until recently, states could use these funds only for cleanup and related administrative and enforcement activities. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the 2005 Act), enacted in August 2005, expanded the permitted uses of the Lust Trust Fund. EPA will undertake a cleanup only when there is a major public health or environmental emergency, and no responsible party is able or willing to provide an adequate and timely response.
