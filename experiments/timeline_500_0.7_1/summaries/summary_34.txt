During the semester we have a few recitation instructors they help with the students during the recitation section. During those sections your the the instructor will solve a similar problem like what is actually covered during the same during the lecture and that give the students another chance to look at more example and to get for media will get used to the calculation which we carry how for the first time during the the lecture. We did not record the Recitation sections during the fall semester in 2016 on the other hand we included problem-solving videos from Professor with Busha.
