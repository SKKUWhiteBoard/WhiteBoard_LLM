that once I take something that's 1,485 calories, I can't take anything else, or maybe 1,200 calories and everything else is more than 300. Once I take one thing, it constrains possible solutions. A greedy algorithm, as we'll see, is not guaranteed to give me the best answer. On Wednesday, we'll talk about how do you actually guarantee finding an optimal solution in a better way than brute force. See you then. you about greedy algorithms. and I'm going to allow myself 1,000 calories. Well, here what we see is the winner will be greedy by value, happens to find a better answer, 424 instead of 413. So there is no way to know in advance. Sometimes this definition of best might work. Sometimes no definition ofbest will work. You can't get to an optimal solution with a greedy algorithm. On Wednesday, we'll talk about how do you actually guarantee finding an optimal Solution in a better way than brute force. John Guttag: The 60002 course is less about programming and more about dipping your toe into the exotic world of data science. The main topic of the course is what I think of as computational models. We'll talk about three kinds of models-- optimization, statistical models, and simulation. An optimization model is a very simple function that can help us to either understand something that has happened, or to build a model that explains phenomena we see every day. The final exam will be a final exam based upon all of the above.
