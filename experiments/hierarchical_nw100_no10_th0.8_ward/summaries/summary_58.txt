In 1998, HEA was amended to include a provision stating that eligible lenders that act as trustees are responsible for meeting statutory and regulatory requirements for the loans they hold as trustees. servicer problems that may result in loan guarantee loss can also occur on loans held by eligible lenders. Department of Education reports that approximately 125 trustee arrangements exist between eligible and ineligible lenders. These arrangements account for $25.3 billion in outstanding loans— approximately 19 percent of student loans.subsidies and insurance claims. Education reimburses guaranty agencies for most of their claims paid to lenders for defaulted loans. Most lenders contract with a third-party entity to service the loan and collect payments from borrowers. Education may assess penalties, refuse to make future payments, or recover payments already made to lenders and agencies for such things as interest subsidies and insurance claims. Some loans lose their federal guarantee because lenders, servicers, or guaranty agency fail to follow the Department’s requirements for making, servicing, and collecting loans or because of fraudulent activity. while allowing ineligible lenders to participate in the program. The HEA provision that holds trustees responsible for an ineligible lender’s loans allows the federal government to recoup the losses from the eligible lender trustee rather than the ineligible lender. Education officials believe they do not have direct oversight authority of ineligible lenders. The federal government will not reimburse the guarantor or the lender for the associated dollar loss. However, because some problems may not be found until after the government has already provided reimbursement, the government may have to recover these monies from the parties involved. agencies. When states failed to establish such agencies, the Congress enacted legislation with several incentives to increase lender and guaranty agency participation. Congress has since shifted some risk back to the guaranty agencies and lenders by reducing the maximum reimbursement and insurance rates on defaulted loans. These actions were intended to encourage both lenders and Guaranty agencies to work with borrowers to make sure they got the loans they were owed. The Congress kept the financial risk almost entirely with the federal government. It also provided federal funds for guaranty. agencies to use as seed money to pay claims. Act to mean that the lender’s FFELP loans can’t total more than one-half of their combined consumer credit loan portfolio, including home mortgages held by the lender or its subsidiaries. Strict application of this rule would require eligible lenders to include loans they hold as a trustee for an ineligible lender in this calculation. Education officials told us that although Education address these loans, it has not yet decided which policy to establish nor how to formalize the decision. If eligible lenders remain unclear and therefore continue to interpret the 50-percent rule, and if the financial industry continues to consolidate, the number of trustees could decline. Representatives of one bank incorrectly interpreted an exception to the 50-percent rule. A representative of another bank said he had turned down eligible lender trustee business because the additional trustee-held loans would put the bank above its legal limit. One trustee representative was not concerned because either calculation—including or excluding the loans—would place the bank in compliance with the act.

Education did not say when it expected to implement our recommendation. Education also provided technical comments, which we incorporated where appropriate.

Ineligible lenders fall into two categories: secondary marketsthat have not been designated as an eligible lender for a state and private companies that wish to make and hold student loans. Eligible and ineligible lenders agree that participation by ineligible lenders increases competition among lenders and can, in turn, contribute to improved service and lower costs for student borrowers. Some ineligible lenders believe that two factors --HEA requirements and the general evolution of financial markets -- could affect their participation in the student loan market in the future.  HEA designates which entities are eligible to make FFELP loans to students. An eligible lender is defined as under certain circumstances, a national or state chartered bank, a mutual savings bank, or a savings and loan association. A pension fund as defined in the Employee Retirement Income Security is an eligible lender. A single agency of the state or a single nonprofit private agency designated by the state are also eligible lenders, HEA says. For more information, go to www.hea.org. the state or a single nonprofit private agency designated by the state; under certain circumstances, an eligible institution; and a consumer finance company subsidiary of a national bank. The majority of organizations making loans to students fall into one of these categories. The Student Loan Marketing Association or the Holding Company of the Student Loan marketing Association is the most common. The state or an agency of any state functioning as a secondary market is also a guaranty agency; a Rural Rehabilitation Corporation is a guarantee agency; and any nonprofit privateagency functioning in any state as asecondary market. Education administers and oversees federal student aid programs authorized by HEA. The five principal entities involved in FFELP are students, schools, lenders, guaranty agencies,and Education. Ineligibles use trustees to securitize portfolios of student loans. This report is concerned primarily with trustee arrangements used to enable ineligible lenders to make and hold student loans, the report says. The government expected to share the program’s financial risks with state-designated guaranty agency. However, when states failed to establish such agencies, the The federal government has additional sources from which to recover any repayments due the government on ineligible lenders’ loans. Because ineligible lenders do not receive any payments directly from Education, it does not have an ability to collect liabilities by offset. The presence of an eligible lender from whom the government can recoup its financial losses is critical since Education has no direct oversight authority to assess the safety and soundness of a bank’s operations. Both eligible and ineligible lenders reported that trustee arrangements have had a positive effect on the student loan market. Eligible lender trustees and ineligible lenders reported limited day-to-day interaction. Trustee arrangements come with some protections to ensure the federal government’s investment in FFELP is secure while allowing ineligible lenders to participate in the program. Some trustees reported that they interact with the ineligible lender only when it is necessary to sign forms, such as quarterly reports that must be submitted to the Department of Education. One trustee reported no daily interaction. The program is funded by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury Department. not have direct oversight authority of ineligible lenders. Most financial institutions that serve as eligible lender trustees are subject to federal (and in many instances, state) oversight. Among the most important of these regulations are those dealing with minimum capital standards. These capital standards provide benchmarks against which regulators can assess the safety and soundness of a bank’s operations as a result of a default. The federal government is likely to recover its losses from trustees for two reasons. First, most financial institutions serve aseligible lender trustees. on the effects of past rulings regarding trustee arrangements. MajorManagementChallengesandProgramRisks: Departmentof Education.

We focused our review on trustee arrangements created to allow ineligible lenders to originate or purchase student loans. To determine the number of existing trustee arrangements, we obtained data from Education’s lender database. For each lender identification number on the trustee arrangement list, we asked the lenders to verify whether the account was used for originations and/or purchases of student loans, securitizations, or some combination of these transactions. We also asked lenders to provide us with information on any additional identification numbers used for trustee arrangements. According to ineligible lenders we interviewed, current initiation and annual trustee fees do not prohibit them from conducting business in the student loan market. Trustees and ineligible lenders reported similar criteria used by trustees to evaluate ineligibles before they entered into arrangements. Trustee-held loans might have an impact on costs, but they reported that costs did not significantly increase or decrease after the 1998 amendments were enacted. We obtained the perspectives of participants on whether trustee arrangements have a positive or negative effect on lenders’ participation in theStudent Loan Market. Trustees and ineligible lenders also reported that their contracts included similar clauses covering trustee and ineligible lender resignations. The trustee arrangements we reviewed were also similar in the requirements placed on the ineligible lender and the amount of monitoring the trustee performed. For example, trustees generally require ineligible lenders to abide by HEA requirements and to oversee the loan servicer. One trustee reported that the monitoring is not specific or regular and mostly involves a review of annual annual reports on the transaction. In any event, most trustees and ineligible borrowers reported trustee.agency’s report on the deal. Four ineligible lenders reported they had a difficult time obtaining their current trustee arrangement. Several others said that finding a trustee in the future would become more problematic. Ineligible lender representatives expressed concern that because trustees also originate student loans for themselves, trustees may decide to end their eligible lender trustee services rather than continue to provide the mechanism for a competitor to do business. A few ineligible lenders stated they were uncomfortable with trustees having the final say as they originate student loan loans for their competitors. The Federal Reserve is expected to announce a plan to consolidate student loan institutions in the coming months. The 125 arrangements represent liaisons between 16 eligible lender trustees and 31 ineligible lenders. Ineligible lenders can be further grouped as 17 secondary markets and 14 other ineligibles. Most ineligible lenders we interviewed stated that the number of available trustees has decreased as eligible lender banks have merged with each other. Recent mergers include First National Bank of Chicago and Bank One, Norwest and Wells Fargo, and Firstar Bank with Star Bank and Mercantile Bank (St. Louis) Financial market analysts expect this consolidation activity to continue. outstanding loan balances or on the outstanding balance of bond issues. Ineligible lenders reported that annual costs are used to maintain the arrangement and cover the necessary services provided by the trustee. Some ineligible lenders feared that the provision of HEA that makes trustees fully responsible for trustee-held loans might have an impact on costs. Some trustees review the structure of the financing method used by the ineligible lender to raise capital necessary to originate or purchase loans. This review might include examining a rating agency’s report on the transaction. reported that initiation costs were generally a flat fee ranging between $2,500 and $20,000. Annual trustee fees reported by ineligible lenders ranged between $4,500 to $75,000, depending on a number of factors. Some secondary markets reported that their trustee charged this initiation fee each time they issued bonds to raise capital. These lenders reported that the fees could be aflat fee or calculated as a percentage of outstanding loan balances or on the outstanding balance of bond balances.
