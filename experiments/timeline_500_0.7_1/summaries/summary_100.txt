In this problem, we're going to be dealing with a variation of the usual coin-flipping problem. But in this case, the bias itself of the coin is going toBe random. And we're told that the expectation of this bias is some mu and that the variance of the bias isSome sigma squared. And what we'll be asked is find a bunch of different expectations, covariances, and variances. We'll see that this problem gives us some good exercise in a few concepts, a lot of iterated expectations. xi and xj are independent. And remember, when random variables are independent, the expectation of product, you could simplify that to be the product of the expectations. So this is, in fact, exactly equal to the variance of Q, which we're told is sigma squared. And we found that for i not equal to j, the coherence of xi and xJ is exactlyequal to sigma squares. And so, because they're correlated, they can't be independent. So we'll be using these facts again later. where if i and j happen just to be the same, that it simplifies to be just the variance. And there's n of them, so we get n times the variance of each one. So what do we learn from this problem? Well, we saw that first of all, in order to find some expectations, it's very useful to use law of iterated expectations. But the trick is to figure out what you should condition on. And that's kind of an art that you learn through more practice.
