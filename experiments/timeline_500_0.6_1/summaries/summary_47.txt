Political philosophy is the oldest of the social sciences. It can boast a wealth of heavy hitters from Plato and Aristotle to Machiavelli, Hobbes, Hegel, Tocqueville, Nietzsche. The study of the great books or great thinkers of the past can easily degenerate into a kind of antiquarianism, into a sort of pedantry, says Professor Steven Smith. But these works provide us with the most basic questions that continue to guide our field, he says. "The ideas of John Maynard Keynes, both economists and political philosophers, when they are right, are more powerful than is commonly understood," says Smith. unnecessary or redundant. It would wither away. Political philosophy exists and only exists in that... call it "zone of indeterminacy" between the "is" and the "ought," between the actual and the ideal. This is why political philosophy is always and necessarily a potentially disturbing undertaking. Those who embark on the quest for knowledge of the best regime may not return the same people that they were before. But there is some compensation for this, I think. The study of political philosophy may be the highest tribute we pay to love.
