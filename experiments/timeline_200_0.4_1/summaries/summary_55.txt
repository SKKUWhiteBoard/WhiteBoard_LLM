HONG LIU: So if you want to compute, say, some scattering amplitude from alpha to beta-- so alpha's some initial state and beta's some final state. Say alpha consists of momentum p1 and PN-- or pm, and beta, say momentum p m plus 1 and pn. And then you can get this scattering amplitude just by taking your momentum-space correlation function, OK, for the n points. So this is obtained by doing a Fourier transform. So any questions on this? Yes? AUDIENCE: So can you explain again why this diagram, like, you have one branch and then there's a loop? the meaning of all these different solutions for alpha and beta or for gammas, OK? So as I mentioned, you can have infinite number of solutions. What's the meaning of them? So first, let's imagine when we look at this equation, so in this matrix equation, then you have this psi which is a four- component vector. So imagine, just say, consider making a basis change in psi. OK, so a basischange in psi just means, in linear algebra, this is a vector. to show, OK, so now we want to show that the Dirac equation has the same property, OK. OK, that's much more nontrivial. Again, it's really ingenious, ingenious, yeah, but we see, actually, it works.OK, so we will do it next time. Next time, we will show you how to do the same thing in a different way. We will do that in a few minutes. We are going to take a break. We're going to have a drink.
