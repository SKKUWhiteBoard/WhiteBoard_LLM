The Peloponnesian War was fought in 431 BC. After the war, Spartan power had grown to an unprecedented degree. For the first time there were lots of Spartans, who had lots of money. The Spartans had choices that they could take. They could either stay in the Pelop onnesus, or they could contest it in their power to control the entire Greek world in the east. Or they could have some control of the Aegean and the Hellespont. The Thirty were deposed by the 3,000, the successor government to the Thirty. They appealed to Sparta for help against this democratic army that Thrasybulus had put out. Sparta did not try to obliterate that army, or as we shall see, treat them as very serious enemies. They worked out an agreement whereby a moderate group of ten Athens would be chosen and a commission sent from Sparta to sit with these Athenians. There would be an amnesty for anybody who were now the losing side.
