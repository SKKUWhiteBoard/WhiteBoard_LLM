The U.S. Supreme Court is the highest federal court in the United States. The job is for life, barring resignation, retirement, or removal from the court by impeachment. So far, six justices have been foreign-born, at least one never graduated from high school, and another was only 32 years old when he joined the bench. Most presidents nominate individuals who broadly share their ideological view, so a president with a liberal ideology will tend to appoint liberals to the court. Of the 112 justices who have held the position, not one has yet been removed from office. to be debated and dissected by the ultimate judges, time and history. To be debated, dissected and debated, we need to look to the past, present and future. We need to see how far we have come and what we can learn from the past. We also need to learn from our mistakes and learn from each other. We want to be the best we can be, and we want to do it in a way that honors the past and the present. We hope you will join us in this quest.
