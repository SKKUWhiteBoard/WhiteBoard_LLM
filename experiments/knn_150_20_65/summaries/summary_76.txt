Rationality, rationality axioms - completeness, reflexivity and transitivity. When our when someone’s preference exhibit these three properties, what does it mean that he is able to completely rank all his choices all his potential choices, with also possibility, with possibility that there are more than one bundle at some ranks this is a possibility. One thing also I should add that he will be able to rank only if he has finite consumption set and also what we have learned that this will translate into a utility function. Monotonicity tells us that indifference curve has to be downward sloping. The other thing that we can get from monotonicity is that indifference Curve cannot be a thick curve. So, whenever we have convexity the indifference curve will look like this. If I do this let me take this zone and look at it in, at the bigger scale what will happen, what we are basically seeing is that. indifference curve is very thin, fine, it is clear. And now we have convexity plus concexity.
