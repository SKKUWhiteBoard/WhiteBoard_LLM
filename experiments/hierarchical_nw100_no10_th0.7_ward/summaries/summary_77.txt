Discussing potential benefits of expanding eligibility to include less-than-halftime students. Administrators, particularly those at public 2-year postsecondary would be removed. They observed that expanding eligibility might increase their institution's cohort default rate. They expressed concern that Stafford borrowing by lower-income student borrowers might burden these students with unmanageable debt. The authors concluded that changing program eligibility may encourage protracted less- Than-Halftime enrollment as a means by which to postpone repayment. They added that changing Stafford eligibility would, they anticipate, result in a large expansion in the number of students participating in the Stafford loan programs. Students with outstanding subsidized Stafford loans must now enter repayment if they enroll for fewer than six credits. Some might choose to enroll for a few credits each term as a way to delay repayment. Some sources of funding available to adult learners, particularly work-related assistance provided by employers or the Lifetime Learning tax credit, permit short- term study that does not lead to a career. There are a variety of formal learning opportunities open to adults, and a range of funding sources that support participation in them. Our estimate of students’ subsidized loan awards is based upon the federal needs analysis methodology for subsidized Stafford loans. For each student we estimated a cost of attendance (minus room and board and personal expenses) for the period enrolled in school (loan COA) We also calculated each student’s estimated financial assistance, adding federal, state, private, and institutional aid. Estimated subsidized loans, if above the loan limit level, were set at the maximum amount allowed by law. For the students attending institutions for which no Stafford loan recipients were reported, we assumed that estimated subsidized loan was $0. Using the 1999-2000 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, we estimated the Stafford subsidized and unsubsidized loans for all students in the sample. We did this by assuming that the proportion of this estimated number of recipients to the total number. of recipients in fiscal year 1999- 2000 would equal the proportion. in school year 2003-04. The average loan award in schoolyear 2003-4 equals the estimated loan volume in. school year 2002-03 divided by the estimated number. recipients. school year 2003-04 by assuming that the proportion of this estimated loan volume to the total loan volume in fiscal year 1999-2000 would equal the proportion. The federal cost of this policy change equals the projected loan volume times the applicable subsidy rate. Federal costs other than the subsidy costs of the loans were not considered. To estimate the average loan awards in school year 2003/04, we projected the estimated number of Stafford loans to be given in the school year. We summed over FFELP/FDLP, school type, and class year. campus administrators anticipate that the change could have undesirable effects on postsecondary institutions and on students. Permitting all less-than-halftime students to participate in the Stafford loan programs would increase federal subsidy costs by approximately $113 million in fiscal year 2004. We estimate that the average unsubsidized Stafford loan taken out by adult students would be approximately $680, while the average subsidized loan would be about $1,200. While administrators pointed to several potential benefits, they far more often pointed to a larger set of disadvantages that might accompany this change. The maximum unsubsidized Stafford loan award is equal to the student’s cost of attendance, subject to statutory limits on annual and cumulative borrowing. Adult students also received financial aid from states, postsecondary institutions, and other federal sources. In 1999-2000, states awarded a total of $975 million to adult students enrolled in undergraduate education, typically on the basis of estimated financial need. About half of the states did not have aid programs in which adults enrolled less than halftime were eligible to participate. Pell Grant awards are prorated by the student’s enrollment intensity. In 1999-2000, the maximum Pell Grant award was $3,125 for fulltime students, while the maximum award for a less-than- halftime student was $781. The maximum unsubsidized Stafford loan award is equal to the student's calculated financial need, subject to statutory limits on annual and cumulative borrowing. For more information on the Pell Grant program, visit http://www.penn.org/penn-grant. Few adults who enrolled less-than-halftime in 1999-2000 had incomes below 150 percent of the federal poverty guideline. About 14 percent of these students received federal Pell Grants to assist them in meeting their costs. Adults who work part-time receive employer financial assistance for enrollment in credential programs less often than those who work fulltime. About half of these low-income adult students had no federal income tax liability and were, therefore, ineligible to receive a Lifetime Learning tax credit, authors say. In 1999-2000, most less-than-halftime adult students received some assistance with their postsecondary education or training costs. Student financial aid from federal, state, and institutional sources comprised the majority of assistance. Most assistance received by higher-income households was provided by work-related sources. Very few adults enrolled on a less- Than-Halftime basis seldom received assistance from either federal WIA or TANF sources. In 1999- 2000, 15 percent of less- than- Halftime adults had a household income below 150 percent of the federal poverty guidelines. A substantially larger proportion of adults who enrolled on a less-than-halftime basis had household incomes over $30,000 than did adults enrolled halftime or more. An estimated 7 percent of all adult students enrolled less than halftime in 1999-2000 had incomes at or below 100 percent of the federal poverty guideline. A majority of these students had incomes above this level. A larger percentage of lower income less- than-Halftime adult students received Pell Grants than other adult students. More than half of those with incomes above 150 percent of federal poverty guidelines had their costs met through all forms of assistance. In 1999-2000, most adult students (85 percent) had incomes above 150 percent of the federal poverty guideline. Only 1 percent received either federal or state student aid. Most who had incomesabove this level were fulltime workers, and a larger share received both federal and state aid. The opposite was true of higher-income adult students, who received 71 percent of their support from work-related sources assistance, the study found. The study was published in the June 2000 issue of the journal American Economic Review. Proposed changes to the Pell Grant program include allowing room and board and miscellaneous personal expenses. Another proposed change would be to allow less-than-halftime students to participate in the Stafford Loan programs. Administrators of postsecondary institutions in the four states we visited expressed concern about potential negative consequences of the Stafford loan proposal. For the purposes of this report, adult students are those who are 24 years or older. The authors reviewed data and literature pertaining to financial aid for adult students and part-time students. They analyzed focus group findings examining the barriers to enrollment. We estimated Pell Grant awards under the current law, and under an alternative COA for the 1999-2000 school year. To receive a Pell Grant under theAlternative COA, the individual must have applied for financial aid. Inherent in this assumption is that an alternative Pell cost of attendance will not affect students’ decisions to apply forFinancial aid. The estimated total federal costs under current law and the alternative COa were student’s estimated Pell Grants to be $0. The same steps were taken in estimating a student�’S Pell Grant. under the alternativeCOA except that the Pell cost. of attendance was estimated to include room and board and personal expenses. all students who are eligible will apply for Stafford loans. Education officials provided information on federal subsidy rates for Stafford Loans. The policy change in the Pell Grant Program we considered was changing the cost of attendance calculation for less-than-halftime students so that it does not exclude room, board and personal expenses. This policy change would increase the number of people who are qualified to receive an award. It would also increase the size of the award program, which would be more generous to students who qualify. them their less-than-halftime adult student population and the implications of changing the Pell Grant and Stafford Loan Programs. We also collected institutional data on spells on less than halftime enrollment among students graduating from 10 of the 19 we visited. We solicited information from each institutional research officer about the reliability of these data and reviewed the data for obvious problems of accuracy and completeness. Because these are not samples of a larger student population, there are no confidence intervals associated with them. The following steps were taken to estimate the additional federal budget costs associated with permitting degree-seeking students. The average Pell Grant in school year 2003-04 equals the estimated federal cost. Federal costs other than the amounts of the Pell Grants were not considered in our analysis. Our estimate of students’ Pell Grant awards is based upon the federal needs analysis methodology for calculating the Pell Grant and the Regular Disbursement Schedule for Determining Less than Halftime Awards (FSA Handbook 1999-2000, Pell Reference) If the student did not apply for financial aid, or the institution they attended did not have any Pell recipients in 1999- 2000, we assumed that the student’s estimated Pell Grant to be $0. federal costs under current law and the alternative COA were calculated by summing the estimated individual grants. Federal costs for school year 1999-2000 were projected to school year 2003-04 by assuming that the ratio of these estimated federal costs to the total cost of the Pell grant program were the same as in 1999- 2000. To estimate the average Pell grant in school, the average grant was used to calculate the number of students who would receive a Pell grant each year. The average grant for a student in school was estimated to be $2,856. is established, it is compared to the cost of attendance at the institution chosen by the student. Pell Grant awards are calculated by subtracting the student’s EFC. If the EFC is greater than the Cost of Attendance, the student is not considered to have financial need for federal Title IV aid programs. The elements included in the student's cost of. attendance for the purpose of calculating the Pell Grant award vary according to the extent of their enrollment, as shown in table 2. There is no consensus within the economic literature on the effect of Pell Grants on enrollment. Seftor and Turner estimated price elasticities that fall in the range of –0.34 to -0.14. To estimate the possible behavioral response to a change in Pell Grant policy, we applied a price elasticity in the middle of those identified by Seft or Turner. We assumed that changes to the Pell Grant cost of attendance methodology, if adopted, would be applied to both dependent and independent students enrolled on a less than halftime basis. increase the number of less-than-halftime students who receive a Pell grant and increase Pell award amounts for those who already receive a grant. The total federal budget cost of changing Pell Grant policy would be approximately $25 million. Of the 33 million people aged 18-35 who are not enrolled in school and without a undergraduate degree, we assumed that only 18 percent of them would consider going to school less than halftime. This is the population who may change their enrollment behavior because of the policy change. Pell Grant awards and price elasticities to the population of all persons 18-35 who were not enrolled in school and who had not earned a postsecondary credential. On this basis, we estimate that the Pell Grant policy change will cause about 35,000 people between the ages of 18 and 35 to enroll less than halftime. This conclusion was reached based upon the following calculations: We found that the average Pell Grant award would increase the average award from $0 to $630 for 0.63. not obligated to enroll in degree or certificate programs, or to complete their studies. Eligibility for the HOPE credit is limited to students who are enrolled halftime or more in a degree or certificates program, and in their first 2 years of postsecondary education. The Lifetime Learning tax credit may be used by tax filers who enroll for any number of credits, and for any course that aids in learning new or improving existing job skills. Both credits are nonrefundable: if the filer has no tax liability, they cannot receive the credit. in assistance, rather than providing a widely available source of assistance to adults who are not currently receiving Pell Grants. In written comments on our draft report, Education stated that it appreciated our thorough review and examination of the financial, and other, impediments that are often unique to adult learners as they pursue postsecondary education and training opportunities. Education noted that the report would complement a recent report of its own and that it would assist Education in achieving one of its departmental strategic goals. Education also provided technical assistance. one of its departmental strategic goals. Education also provided technical comments, which we incorporated where appropriate. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its date. At that time we will send copies to the Secretary of Education and other interested parties. We will also make copies available to others on request. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov. enrollment among adult students and the characteristics, completion rates, and financial support they received. We analyzed two datasets created by the National Center for Education Statistics: the 1999-2000 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) and the 2001 Beginning Postsecondary Students Study (BPS) Both datasets contained a nationally representative sample of students enrolled at postsecondary institutions participating in federal student aid programs. We computed estimates of the Lifetime Learning credits received by adult students in the U.S. and Canada. We computed estimates of the Lifetime Learning credits received by less-than-halftime adult students. NPSAS data are collected at the individual student level, and cannot be aggregated into families or linked to tax filing status. We reviewed existing information about the sample, including the documentation produced by NCES, and performed electronic testing of the required data elements to detect obvious problems in accuracy and completeness. We determined that the N PSAS and BPS sample data were reliable and that they could be used for future studies. accuracy and completeness. We determined that the NPSAS and BPS data were sufficiently reliable for this report. Because both surveys are samples of a larger student population, there is some sampling error associated with them. Sampling errors are often represented as a 95-percent confidence interval: an interval that 95 times out of 100 will contain the true population value. The upper and lower bounds of the 95- percent confidence intervals for each estimate are presented in the tables in appendix II. National datasets provide valuable but limited information. employment-related assistance or skills training, and generally does not support extended training of adult students pursuing a postsecondary credential. Less than 1 percent of less-than-halftime adult students received TANF assistance in 1999-2000, and NPSAS says. The time and dollar limits established by local workforce investment boards may make it difficult for adult students to use WIA funds for the extended training that may be required for the completion of a vocational credential, even for those who are enrolled on a fulltime basis. of their spouse and dependents. For taxpayers filing jointly, both credits were initially phased out at $80,000 adjusted gross income. Less than 1 percent of all less-than-halftime adult students received either WIA or TANF assistance with the cost of postsecondary education in 1999-2000. WIA funds may be used for postsecondary training only for expenses remaining after the receipt of Pell Grant and other sources of funding. A larger share received both employer assistance and Lifetime Learning tax credits than did their lower-income counterparts. Under PRWORA, block grants are made to states, which may use these funds to assist TANF recipients in meeting costs associated with vocational training or education, including postsecondary education. These costs may include tuition and fees, childcare, and transportation. In 1999-2000, one-third of adult undergraduate students, about 2.3 million, enrolled less than halftime, and most worked fulltime and part-time. After the receipt of Pell Grant and other sources of assistance, students may be eligible for WIA funds. Institutional eligibility requirements help to ensure that participating institutions provide students with quality education or training. Programs authorized under Title IV include Pell Grants for low-income students and Stafford Loans. Title IV also authorizes programs funded by the federal government and administered by participating higher education institutions, commonly known as campus-based aid. Students who apply for Title IV aid must do so using the Free Application for Funding for Higher Education, or FAFHE, a federal program that helps students pay for higher education. tax credit, permit short- term study that does not lead to the completion of a degree or certificate. Both employers and employees may benefit as skills, productivity, and earnings increase. The Higher Education Act’s provisions concerning institutional eligibility help to ensure billions of dollars in federal student assistance is available only to those institutions that provide students with quality education or training worth the time, energy, and money that they—and the nation�s taxpayers—invest. The federal investment in Title IV programs is used to support learning that is broadly beneficial to the public, rather than students’ recreational or leisure activities. degree, and many others expect to do so, but are unable to continue to completion. If less than halftime adults who do not complete a credential nonetheless benefit from completing a few postsecondary courses, then federal policy tools designed to support shorter-term and non-credential adult learning can better assist these learners. The potential costs of proposed changes to the Pell Grant and Stafford Loan programs, particularly the latter, may outweigh their potential benefits for less-than- halftime adult students, the authors say. About $1 billion was available to the nation’s veterans and eligible service members through the Montgomery GI Bill. Financial assistance was also available to adult students from work- related sources. Employers may pay postsecondary educational expenses directly, or indirectly through employee reimbursement, and they are encouraged to do so by the federal government. The federal government also offers two federal higher education tax credits and from employer-provided educational assistance. The largest of which was Montgomery GIBill assistance. It is available on the basis of considerations other than financial need. employee reimbursement, and they are encouraged to do so by the federal tax code. In 1999-2000, employers provided $1.28 billion in assistance to adult students enrolled in undergraduate postsecondary education. Most often to those workers who were most likely to increase company productivity or profitability as a result of their education, such as high-skill, high-demand workers and managers.Employees were usually required by employers to meet a number of conditions to obtain this educational assistance. But they were not obligated to enroll in degree or certificate programs, or to work full time. In the 1999-2000 academic year, adult students received about $3.3 billion in grant assistance and $8.5 billion in loan assistance from programs authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. To receive federal financial aid, students must meet several eligibility requirements, including being enrolled in a degree or certificate program, and maintaining satisfactory academic progress. Institutions are required to establish qualitative and quantitative criteria of satisfactory progress, and to monitor student progress. Taken together, these requirements help to ensure that Title IV funds are used in ways that benefit both students and the larger students. IV aid must do so using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) Information from the FAFSA is used to determine the amount of money that the adult student is expected to contribute to his or her own education. Statutory definitions establish the criteria that students must meet to be considered independent of their parents for purposes of financial aid. Once the EFC is established, it is compared to the cost of attendance to determine how much the student can expect to contribute. The student's expected family contribution (EFC) is based on income and assets that are expected to be available. offered by postsecondary institutions that are not part of a credential program, such as a continuing education class. Enrolling in a certificate or degree program at a postsecondary institution is an important opportunity for millions of adults who seek personal growth, or advancement in their working lives. In the 1999-2000 academic year, an estimated 7.1 million adults were enrolled as undergraduates. About three- quarters of these adult undergraduates were between the ages of 24 to 40, while about one-quarter were 41 or older. Adult students enrolled in 1999-2000 were more likely to be working full time (35 or more hours per week), to be married, to have dependents, and to lack a conventional high school diploma. While the majority of undergraduates under the age of 24 were enrolled in baccalaureate programs, adult undergraduate students were primarily enrolled in certificate or associate programs. Most adult students (55 percent) were enrolled at 2-year public institutions, while another 22 percent were enrolling in a public institution. In 1999, an estimated 90 million persons 16 and older reported that they had participated in some sort of formal learning activity. Much of this learning takes place outside of formal credential programs that confer a certificate or degree. In the workplace, where employers offer classes for job-specific skills, or in the many courses offered by postsecondary institutions that are not part of a formal credential program. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that 1 in 4 adults are involved in some form of learning in the United States. National data indicate that adults enrolled on a less than halftime basis are more likely to be encountering academic difficulties than other adult students. Some adults who enroll in credit-bearing courses at postsecondary institutions may not intend to complete a degree or certificate. Few adults who succeeded in completing a certificate or degree consistently enrolled on the less-than-halftime basis, authors say. They estimate that about two-thirds (66 percent) of adults who began in 1995-1996 did not complete a certificates or degree by 2001-2002. Most adults who enroll as less than halftime students intend to complete a degree or certificate, but few do. Compared with adult students enrolled halftime or more, the typical less-than-halftime adult student was older, more likely to be working and married, and had a higher household income. A substantially larger larger number of adults enrolled in 2-year postsecondary institutions than did other adult students. (See table 3.) Most worked fulltime and needed to balance the demands of school with other responsibilities. In 1999-2000, one-third, about 2.3 million, of adult undergraduate students were enrolled less than halftime. Of the 1,830 baccalaureate graduates who completed their degrees in 2001- 2002 at four 4-year institutions we visited, slightly more than one-half never enrolled on a less-than-halftime basis, and another 36 percent did so for only one or two terms. In 1999- 2000, about 7 in 10 of the nation’s less- Than-Halftime adult students received assistance equaling about 44 percent of their school costs. Working students may be unable to enroll on a halftime or fulltime basis due to the inflexibility of course and program options made available by postsecondary institutions. Adults may find it easier to plan and manage their schedules over 5 to 7 weeks than they do over longer time periods, such as a traditional 10 or 15- week semester. Administrators at one community college pointed to a lack of flexibility in employer work schedules, noting that adult students often withdraw from class when their employer changes their work schedule, preventing them from attending class. Adult students choose to enroll on a less-than-halftime basis for many reasons. Most important of which, most school administrators told us, is their need to balance school requirements with the competing demands of work and family. Scheduling conflicts also played a role, according to college administrators, in influencing enrollment decisions. While many adult students receive some financial support towards postsecondary costs, most students pay the majority of school costs from their own resources. For a three-person household, enrolling less than halftime can provides them with a way to reduce out-of-pocket costs associated with tuition and fees. Some adults might not be ready academically or socially for postsecondary education. Adult students often need to refresh or develop college-level skills, administrators say. One administrator noted that some adult students at her institution experienced stress-related illnesses after they had begun their coursework and needed to leave mid-semester. National data indicate that adult students are less likely to attend college than other demographic groups, according to a report by the National Council on Postsecondary Education (NCPE) The NCPE report was published in the spring of 2013. is a cross-sectional rather than longitudinal study, and it, therefore, cannot be used to identify the duration for which students enrolled on a less-than-halftime basis. We augmented national datasets with information collected from postsecondary institutions. We interviewed school administrators from 19 institutions, including public and private schools and 2-year and 4-year institutions. These institutions were located in four states—California, Maryland, Ohio, and Virginia—in which the costs for resident tuition and fees were lower than those in other states. we analyzed focus group findings examining the barriers to enrollment and persistence faced by low-income adults. We interviewed officials at the Department of Education, researchers, and representatives of higher education organizations. We also reviewed studies and surveys of employer- provided educational assistance. To determine the extent of less-than-halftime enrollment among adult students, we looked at the characteristics, completion rates, and completion rates of institutions of higherEducation.org. We looked at four sample states: New York, Connecticut, Maryland and New Jersey. costs for resident tuition and fees at public 2-year institutions and the amount of available state aid varied. For example, in California the cost for resident 2- year tuition was lower than for all other states ($330), but no state aid is available to students pursuing their postsecondary credentials on a less-than-halftime basis. Maryland ranked 9th among states in tuition and Fees ($2,564) and, like California, did not have state financial aid available to less- Than-Halftime students. Both Virginia and Ohio had state aid available for less- than- Halftime students; however, Virginia’s $1,304 tuition was higher than that of Ohio. less-than-halftime students would be approximately $25 million for the 2003-2004 academic year. If about 35,000 individuals who are not in school respond to this change in policy by enrolling less than halftime, an estimate implied, in part, by some research, there could be an additional federal budget cost of about $10 million. This enrollment response would cost the federal government $9,764,063 ( x $630+ [33,000,000 x 0.18 x 111/500 X 0.24] x $111). We were asked to determine: (1) the extent to which adults enroll less than halftime, the characteristics and factors associated with less-than- halftime enrollment, and the rates of completion among these students. We were also asked to look at whether these students receive federal, state, and other assistance to help them meet the costs of postsecondary education. If you or your staff have any questions or wish to discuss this material further, please call me at (202) 512-8403. to receive an award, and it would increase the size of the award for those who are already qualified. This policy change may cause people to change their postsecondary enrollment behavior. Some people who are not enrolled in postsecondary education may choose to enroll less than halftime in response to the policy change. As Seftor and Turner note, there is no consensus within the economic literature on the effect of this policy change on the economy. The policy change is expected to take effect on January 1, 2015. less-than-halftime adult students received TANF assistance in 1999-2000. NPSAS collected no data on the extent to which T ANF funds assisted these students in meeting costs associated with their training or education. School officials at the institutions we visited were generally unaware of the extent of adult students' TANf assistance. One school, however, had created a program to enable TAN F recipients to attend school fulltime. In Maryland, the Baltimore City Community College and city and state officials established the School Counts Program.
