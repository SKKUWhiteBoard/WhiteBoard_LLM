that we are going to be looking for in an estimator, trying to find them to be unbiased. But we'll see that it's actually maybe not enough. So unbiasedness should not be something you lose your sleep over. Something that's slightly better is the risk, really the quadratics risk, which is expectation of-- so if I have an estimators, theta hat, I'm going to look at the expectation of theta hats n minus theta squared. And so for example, if the quadratic risk goes to 0, then that means that thetahat converges to theta in the L2 sense. this constant is 0 for my purposes, or 25 if you prefer. All right. So we'll just keep going on this property next time. And we'll see how from here we can move on to-- the likelihood is actually going to come out of this formula. Thanks.

Maximum likelihood is the function, so we need to maximize a function. Sometimes, you have closed-form solutions. You can take the derivative and set it equal to 0 and solve it. But sometimes, you actually need to resort to algorithms to do that. And we'll briefly touch upon it, but this is definitely not the focus of this class. We'll just keep going on this property next time. OK? Any other question. Thanks.
