Chess has been known as a tool of military strategy, a metaphor for human affairs, and a benchmark of genius. The game was originally known as chaturanga– a Sanskrit word for "four divisions" With its spread to Sassanid Persia, it acquired its current name and terminology– "chess," derived from "shah," meaning king, and “checkmate” from “shah mat," or “the king is helpless” After the 7th century Islamic conquest of Persia, chess was introduced to the Arab world. Deep Blue’s triumph over Garry Kasparov in 1997 was the first time a machine had defeated a sitting champion. Today, chess software is capable of consistently defeating the best human players. But just like the game they’ve mastered, these machines are products of human ingenuity. And perhaps that same ingenuity will guide us out of this apparent checkmate, as it did in the case of chess greats such as Benoît Mitterrand and Toulouse-Laffitte.
