In fiscal year 1998, the Congress appropriated $25 billion in discretionary budget authority for the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) programs. HUD provides rental housing assistance-about $21 billion in fiscal year 1996—that enables about 4.7 million low-income households to obtain safe, decent, and affordable housing. HUD assists about two-thirds of these households through its Section 8 housing assistance program. HUD estimates that the cost of contract renewals for the tenant-based program alone will increase from $2.5 billion in 1997 to $10.5billion in 2002.
