CMS reported total obligations for CMS contracts in fiscal year 2008 were $3.6 billion. This amount includes obligations against contracts that process Medicare claims. Obligations for other- than-claims processing activities, such as the 1-800 Medicare help line, are also included in the total. Since 1998, obligations to fiscal intermediaries, carriers, and Medicare Administrative Contractors have decreased approximately 16 percent. The $3 million obligated in 2008 represents a 71 percent increase since 1998, when $2.1 billion was obligated. 1-800 help line, information technology and financial management initiatives, and program management and consulting services, have increased 466 percent. These trends may be explained in part by recent changes to the Medicare program. MMA required CMS to transition its Medicare claims processing contracts, which generally did not follow Medicare claims. These specialized contractors, such as beneficiary contact center contractors and enterprise data center contractors, are categorized below as other-than-claims processing contractors, as shown in figure 1. services such as data centers, and certain financial management activities, have moved from fiscal intermediaries and carriers to specialized contractors. the FAR, to the FAR environment through the award of contracts to Medicare Administrative Contractors. CMS projected that the transition, referred to as Medicare contracting reform, would produce administrative cost savings due to the effects of competition and contract consolidation. The transition would subject millions of dollars of CMS acquisitions to the rules, standards, and requirements for the award, administration, and termination of government contracts in the FAR. Obligations to the new Medicare administrative Contractors were first made in fiscal year 2009-10. CMS is required to complete Medicare contracting reform by 2011. As of September 1, 2009, 19 contracts have been awarded to Medicare Administrative Contractors, totaling about $1 billion in obligations to date. Except for certain Medicare claims processing contracts, CMS contracts are generally required to be awarded and administered in accordance with general government procurement laws and regulations. OAGM manages contracting activities and is responsible for, among other things, developing policy and administering contracts. The Office of Government Contracting Management (OAGM) was established in 2007. All but one of the key roles described below are managed centrally in OAGM. The last, project officers, are assigned from CMS program offices. Contracting officers are responsible for ensuring performance of all necessary actions for effective contracting. They are also responsible for overseeing contractor compliance with the terms of the contract, and safeguarding the interests of the government in its contractual relationships. The contracting officer is responsible for negotiating, award, administration, and termination of contracts. The contract officer is the person in charge of negotiating, awarding, and terminating contracts. officer is authorized to enter into, modify, and terminate contracts. Contract specialists represent and assist the contracting officers with the contract, but are generally not authorized to commit or bind the government. The cost/price team serves as an in-house consultant to others involved in the contracting process at CMS. By request, the team, which consists of four contract auditors, provides support for contract administration including contract administration, procurement and other areas of the government’s business.

Project officers serve as the contracting officer's technical representative designated to monitor the contractor’s progress. According to OAGM invoice review policy, project officers review certain invoice elements, such as labor and direct costs, and are required to certify whether the invoice is approved for payment by signing a Payments and Progress Certification Form. They may also conduct periodic analyses of contractor performance and cost data. The PRISM database contains basic information such as contract number, vendor name, and amount obligated. The Enhanced Departmental Contracts Information System (DCIS) is used for department-level acquisition management. DCIS collects and forwards information to the Federal Procurement Data System Next Generation (FPDS-NG), which is a publicly available database of governmentwide acquisition information. Likewise, FPDS- NG feeds into www.usaspending.gov, a Web site created by the Department of Homeland Security. Agencies may choose among different contract types to acquire goods and services. Contract types can be grouped into three broad categories: fixed price contracts, cost reimbursement contracts, and time and materials (T&M) contracts. The government assumes most of the cost risk because the contractor is only required to provide its best effort to meet contract objectives within the estimated cost. For T&M contracts, the government agrees to pay fixed per-hour labor rates and to reimburse other costs directly related to the contract. Government provide framework for establishing and maintaining internal control. Management should establish both a supportive overall control environment and specific control activities. A positive control environment provides discipline and structure as well as a climate supportive of quality internal control, and includes an assessment of the risks of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. It also includes an environment that sets a positive and supportive attitude towards control and conscientious management. For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or see www.samaritans.org.  control activities are the policies, procedures, techniques, and mechanisms that enforce management’s directives and help ensure that actions are taken to address risks. The standards provide that information should be recorded and communicated to management and oversight officials in a form and within a time frame that enables them to carry out their responsibilities. An entity should have internal control monitoring activities in place to assess the quality of performance over time and ensure that the findings of audits and other reviews are promptly resolved. Control activities include both external and internal sources. preventive and detective controls. Preventive controls are controls designed to prevent errors, improper payments, or waste. Detective controls are designed to identify errors or improper payments after the payment is made. A sound system of internal control contains a balance of both preventive and Detective controls that is appropriate for the agency’s operations.

A key concept introduced in our standards is that control activities selected for implementation be cost beneficial. A control activity can be preventive, detective, or both based on when the control occurs in the contract life cycle. We found pervasive deficiencies in internal control over contracting and payments to contractors. The internal control deficiencies occurred throughout the contracting process, that is both pre- and post-award, and increase the risk of improper payments. These deficiencies were due in part to a lack of agency-specific policies and procedures to ensure that FAR requirements and other control objectives were met. CMS also did not take appropriate steps to. ensure that existing policies were properly implemented nor maintain. adequate documentation in its contract files. The Contract Review Board was not effective in ensuring proper contract award actions. These internal control deficiencies are a manifestation of CMS’s weak overall control environment, which is discussed later. As a result of our work, we estimate that at least 84.3 percent of FAR- based contract actions made by CMS in fiscal year 2008 contained at least. at least one of these deficiencies. one instance in which a key control was not adequately implemented. Many contract actions had more than one deficiency. At least 37.2 percent of FAR-based contract actions made in fiscal year 2008 had three or more instances of not being implemented. The controls ranged from ensuring contractors had adequate accounting systems prior to the use of a cost reimbursement contract to certifying invoices for payment. The U.S. Air Force is one of the largest military contractors in the world, with more than 1,000 employees. The high percentage of deficiencies indicates a serious failure of control procedures over FAR-based acquisitions. This creates a heightened risk of making improper payments or waste. We determined a control to be “key” based on our review of the standards for internal control as well as the FAR, HHSAR, and agency policies. We also took into consideration prior audit findings and the contract types CMS most frequently used. See appendix I for additional details on the controls we tested and the statistical sample results. the results of our statistical sample conservatively by reporting the lower bound of our two-sided, 95 percent confidence interval. The control deficiencies we found were primarily caused by a lack of agency-specific policies and procedures that would help ensure that applicable FAR requirements, agency policies, and other control objectives were met. CMS did not always meet FAR requirements for specific contract types that were awarded, nor maintain adequate support for approved provisional indirect cost rates. The agency did not timely perform or request audits of incurred direct costs. At least 46.0 percent of fiscal year 2008 CMS contract actions did not meet the FAR requirements applicable to the specific contract type awarded. Of the contract awards in our sample, we found 9 cases in which cost reimbursement contracts were used without first ensuring that the contractor had an adequate accounting system. For 17 contract actions that utilized indirect cost rates, CMS did not have documentation supporting what would be the appropriate provisional indirect cost rate for the contractor. For an additional 19 contract actions, the provisional rates either did not match the indirect rates billed on the invoices or could not be matched because the invoice did not provide sufficient detail. final indirect cost rates or support for the prompt request of an audit of indirect costs. The amounts a contractor billed using provisional indirect cost Rates are adjusted annually for final indirect cost Rate. Final indirect cost rate rates are generally negotiated by the government’s negotiating team that includes the government. The FAR states that final indirect costs rates are based on the actual indirect costs incurred during a given fiscal year, shall be used in reimbursing indirect costs under cost reimbursement contracts. It provides a mechanism for the government to timely ensure that indirect costs are allowable and allocable to the contract. the CFA following an audit of a statement of incurred costs submitted by the contractor. CMS officials told us that they generally adjust for final indirect cost rates during contract closeout at the end of the contract performance rather than annually due to the cost and effort the adjustment takes. When CMS is not the CFA, CMS must wait on the C FA to perform the necessary audit work required to establish the final indirect Cost Rates. Not annually adjusting for final direct cost rates increases the risk that CMS will not be able to meet its obligations. CMS is paying for costs that are not allowable or allocable to the contract. Putting off the control activity until the end of contract performance increases the risk of overpaying for indirect costs during contract performance. We estimate that for at least 54.9 percent of fiscal year 2008 contract actions, CMS did not promptly perform or request an audit of direct costs. We found that 25 contract actions for which this control applied did not have an audit. It may make identification or recovery of any unallowable costs duringcontract closeout more difficult due to the passage of time. of direct costs promptly performed or requested. Similar to the audit of indirect costs, audits of direct costs allow the government to verify that the costs billed by the contractor were allowable, reasonable, and allocable to the contract. The audit ofdirect costs is the responsibility of the contracting officer. The contracting officer may request, for a fee, that the CFA for the contractor perform the audit work. The FAR does not provide time frames or other requirements for when the audit should be performed except that such an audit may be necessary for closing out a contract. CMS had policies for invoice certification and purchase card oversight. These policies were not consistently followed. Not annually auditing direct costs increases the risk that CMS is paying for costs that are not allowable or allocable to the contract. The failure to follow established agency policy increases CMS’s risk of improperly paying contractor invoices or purchase card transactions, the report says. The report also found two instances where the contractor billed, and CMS paid, this cost. The total value of the contract through January 2009 was about $64 million. did not perform required audits and reviews of CMS purchase cards to identify fraud or waste. As of July 15, 2009, OAGM’s purchase card program had issued 123 cards with 20 percent having monthly spending limits of at least $50,000. Eight card holders had monthly spending limit of $100,000, the highest spending limit authorized by CMS. CMS does not have assurance that only allowable transactions are procured through purchase cards and that the purchase cards are not being used. HHS purchase card policy guidance provides that the purchase card coordinator, which at CMS is within OAGM, is required to conduct surveillance of the program. We spoke with an OAGC supervisor who said the agency did not perform the oversight activities because the supervisor viewed those activities as the responsibility of the Office of Financial Management (OFM) The supervisor also said that the agency was not required to monitor cardholder transactions using such methods as statistical and nonstatistical sampling, data mining, and spot checks.to circumvent FAR competition requirements. OFM does not review purchase card transactions for fraud or inappropriate use, but instead pays the purchase card invoice based on the authorizing official’s approval. Standards for internal control call for transactions and other significant events to be clearly documented, and the documentation should be readily available for examination. In addition, the FAR provides that the documentation in the contract files shall be sufficient to constitute a complete history. During the tests of control procedures, we observed that the contracts did not always contain all required documentation to support the contract actions we reviewed. of the contract action for the purpose of providing a basis for informed decisions at each step in the acquisition process, and providing information for reviews and investigations. Incomplete or inadequate contract files and documentation hinder the ability of the contracting officers to perform their oversight duties, especially those who assume responsibility for contracts that have changed hands. Clearly documenting the history of a contract action is an important tool that provides management with assurance that the agency has complied with applicable regulations and has made well-informed decisions for efficient contract management. contract. CMS contract files did not always contain documentation necessary to support the action. In numerous instances, we determined that the letter delegating duties to the project officer and the project manager was not properly written. In addition, two contract files. did not maintain any information regarding the General Services Administration schedule contract. that was valid at the time of the award of the task order. We found a contract file was missing a statement of work and another file wasMissing a copy of the actual contract. training certificate for the project officer were not in the file. Also, a chronological list of contracting officers and their dates of responsibility was consistently absent. CMS’s use of negotiation memorandums was inconsistent, the report said. The HHSAR provides that the negotiation memorandum is a complete record of all actions leading to the award of a contract, according to the report. It should be in sufficient detail to explain and support the rationale, judgments, and authorities upon which all actions were predicated, it said. be signed by the contract negotiator. However, negotiation memorandums were not always prepared for actions in which they were clearly required, according to HHSAR. While many negotiation Memorandums we reviewed had signature blocks for both the contract specialist and the contracting officer (generally the preparer and reviewer, respectively), the memorandum was not always signed. CMS’s OAGM established the Contract Review Board (CRB) reviews as a key control procedure to help ensure contract award actions are in conformance with law. policies and procedures, and sound business practices. Our review of the CRB process found that the process had not been properly or fully implemented. For example, of the 22 contracts selected to be reviewed by theCRB in 2008, only 7 were actually reviewed. For fiscal year 2009, 22 contracts were selected but only 2 have been reviewed as of the end of the third quarter. Also, the contracting officer for the contract action being reviewed is neither required to reach consensus on the resolution of issues identified nor to document the resolution. OAGM’s policies require that all contracts above $10 million be subjected to the CRB. CMS confirmed that only contracts nominated by division directors are reviewed. CMS policies do not require issues to be resolved and documented and because CMS is not fully implementing theCRB, opportunities to resolve CRB issues may be missed. If used correctly, the CRb can be an effective tool for risk-based quality assurance and for reviewing the internal controls throughout the contract award and administration process. CMS’s FAR-based contract management was impaired by a weak control environment. Staff resources allocated to contract oversight had not kept pace with the increase in CMS contract awards. A shortage of human resources creates an environment that hinders the contracting process. CMS has not yet determined the amount of total FTEs needed for the fiscal year and beyond.. Using contractors for contract administrative functions may increase the risk of establishing unauthorized personal services contracts or of contractors performing inherently governmental functions, both of which are prohibited by FAR. The acquisition data errors are due in part to a lack of sufficient quality assurance activities over the data entered into the acquisition databases. Without accurate data, CMS program managers do not have adequate information to identify and monitor areas that pose a high risk of improper payments or waste. The errors in DCIS, including the unrecorded actions, also impact governmentwide reporting. Only two of GAO’s nine 2007 recommendations had been fully addressed by CMS in 2009, the GAO found in its assessment of the contracting process. Roles and responsibilities for implementation of CFA responsibilities not clearly defined. HHS officials said that they did not have a process to identify the contractors, including CMS contractors, for which HHS would be the CFA. CMS policies did not provide guidance on what constitutes sufficient detail to support amounts billed on contractor invoices to facilitate the review process. Without effective coordination, contractors may not receive the necessary oversight and the government may not be positioned to protect itself from the risk of improper payments or waste. CMS has not set criteria for the use of negative certification. Reviewing invoices prior to payment is a preventive control. We found that OAGM’s invoice review policy was too lax. We recommended that CMS establish criteria for when to use negative certification, such as considerations of potential risk factors such as contract type, the adequacy of the contractor�s accounting system, and prior history with the contractor. The committee found that CMS’ invoice review policies were too lax and that the review process was not sufficiently rigorous. was not revised to address this recommendation and OAGM officials confirmed that negative certification is still the primary method for paying invoices regardless of risks. Training on invoice review procedures still needed. As discussed earlier, project officers did not always certify invoice for approval and contracting officers or specialists did not often identify instances where invoiced did not comply with contract terms and conditions. We also found that invoICES were not always maintained in the file, as required by CMS’s invoice review policy. CMS did not timely perform contract closeout procedures resulting in a backlog of 1,300 contracts, of which 407 were overdue for closeout as of September 30, 2007. We recommended that CMS develop a plan to reduce the number of contracts in the backlog. CMS did not provide us a closeout plan for fiscal year 2008 and the fiscal year 2009 plan was insufficient. Specifically, the plan did not include a comprehensive strategy to reduction the backlog of contracts.described above, further training on invoice review procedures will be necessary. contracts that are eligible and overdue for closeout nor did it contain a workload analysis. The FAR establishes time standards for closing out a contract after the work is physically completed. The contract closeout process is an important internal control, in part, because it is generally the last opportunity for the government to detect and recover any improper payments. The complexity and the cost of closing out contracts can be difficult to estimate, according to the government's contract review process, which can take up to a year. length of the closeout process can vary with the extent of oversight performed by the agency during the period of performance and the contract type. CMS officials told us that during fiscal year 2008, OAGM closed 581 contracts and reduced the overdue backlog to 400 contracts (from the 407 reported at the end of fiscal year 2007) Yet O AGM officials could not provide support for these closures or a list of the contracts overdue for closeout. As of July 29, 2009, the total backlog of contracts eligible forcloseout was 1,611, with 594 overdue. The total contract value of contracts eligible for closeout has increased from $3 billion to at least $3.8 billion. This is a substantial increase over the balances at the end of fiscal year 2007. The closeout process is particularly important for cost reimbursement contracts because a contractor is allowed to bill costs it incurred to provide the good or service. The government audits these billed costs to determine if they were allowable and allocable to the contract, the report says. It says insufficient progress has been made to reduce the backlog of contracts. and processes the final invoice with an adjustment for any over- or underpayments. The failure to perform contract closeouts in a timely manner puts CMS at increased risk of improper payments or waste, and may make identification and recovery of any such improper payments more difficult due to the passage of time. CMS has not taken sufficient actions to investigate and recover questionable payments. CMS described several actions it has taken to investigate payments made to 3 of the 12 contractors for which we identified questionable payments, but they are insufficient to fully resolve the problem. issues identified and more remains to be done to recover funds that may have been inappropriately paid to contractors. CMS relies on incurred cost audits that are conducted at the end of contract performance when the contract is closed to validate the overall propriety of payments. CMS’s backlog of contracts eligible for closeout delays investigations and makes recovery more difficult. CMS does not track, investigate, and resolve contract audit and evaluation findings for purposes of cost recovery and future award decisions. We found no evidence of any plans or procedures that would mitigate the identified risks. internal controls that are and can be instituted by agencies to help safeguard assets, prevent and detect fraud and errors. As described in appendix I, we selected 11 controls that we determined to be “key” based on GAO’s standards for internal control, the FAR and HHSAR. CMS stated its belief that “virtually all” of the errors we identified related to “perceived documentation deficiencies.” “Virtually all,” is the key word. CMS stated it was encouraged that the errors we found did not involve more substantive departures from the FAR or HHSAR. A number of the findings we identified during the testing of a statistically valid sample of contract files involved the lack of documentation that the controls were performed. Lack of documentation reduces management’s ability to ascertain whether these important controls were appropriately implemented. The internal controls we tested are key to ensuring that contracting activities, both pre and post-award, mitigate risks to the federal government. OAGM management’s downplaying of the overall message of the report—that control deficiencies are pervasive—further illustrates the weak internal control environment. Setting an appropriate control environment, especially “tone at the top,” is key to ensuring that staff take all appropriate steps to mitigate risk and protect tax dollars from fraud, waste, and abuse. CMS also stated that a reasonable amount of time had not yet elapsed since the issuance of our November 2007 report to allow for corrective actions to have taken place. A significant number of our current report findings, including weaknesses in the system, are a serious internal control deficiency. in the control environment, were based on observations and interviews with OAGM officials and reviews of related documentation such as policies and strategic plans. Our current review was completed in September 2009, nearly 2 years after the issuance of our November 2007 report. While CMS also stated that the contract actions we reviewed took place in fiscal year 2008, it is important to note that we considered the timing of CMS’s corrective actions when evaluating the controls we tested. For example, CMS�s Acquisition Policy 02-03, which identifies level of approvals required by agency officials based on the estimated dollar value. for acquisitions awarded through other than full and open competition, was implemented in April 2008. We applied these approval levels only to the awards and modifications in our sample that were made after the policy was implemented. CMS disagreed with our determination that their actions to address five of the seven prior recommendations were not sufficient. These prior recommendationswere aimed at improving preventive controls. Preventive controls, such as policies and criteria for pre-award activities and a sound invoice, are important to CMS’s control environment. review process prior to payment, are the first line of defense in reducing the risk of improper payments or waste. We continue to believe that the limited actions OAGM management has taken, and in some cases, management’s inaction, fall short of expectations. CMS asserted that its Acquisition Policy 16-01 entitled “Invoicing Payment Procedures” satisfies two of the prior recommendations. The intent of these two recommendations was to ensure that contractors provided adequate support to facilitate an appropriate detailed review of the invoiced costs. CMS uses negative certification to ensure invoices are paid in a timely fashion. CMS did not provide the recommended additional guidelines on what the contractor should provide that would constitute sufficient detail to support amounts billed. CMS had taken some action, but the steps have not resolved the questionable payments we identified, we found. We revised our assessment of the status of efforts taken by CMS from “No Actions Taken” to “Actions Insufficient.’“We found it to be unresponsive to the recommendations," the report said. highlighted $67 million that we previously questioned that was related to one specific contractor. These questionable payments are being investigated via a fiscal year 2008 incurred cost audit. We continue to believe that CMS’s actions to date are insufficient and more actions need to be taken. As of the date of the report, CMS could not tell us whether it had recovered any of the questioned amounts. The $67million we questioned related to costs incurred in fiscal years 2004, 2005, and 2006 and therefore would not be covered or investigated in an audit of fiscal Year 2008 incurred costs. are needed to investigate and recover the questionable payments we identified. No other changes were made to the report as a result of agency comments. See appendix III for a discussion of the remaining two prior recommendations (points 2, 3, and 4) for which CMS disagreed with our assessment of its progress. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its date. At that time, we will send copies to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and interested congressional committees. Copies will also be available to others on request. Report will be available at no charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov.

Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs are found on the last page of this report. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented effective internal control procedures over contract actions. We focused on contracts that were generally subjected to the Federal Acquisition Regulation. We interviewed senior management of CMS’s Office of Acquisition and Grants Management (OAGM), contracting officers and specialists, and cost/price team members. We selected 11 internal controls over contracting and payments to contractors to test for this report, ranging from ensuring contractors had adequate accounting systems prior to the use of them. a cost reimbursement contract to certifying invoices for payment. We selected controls to test based on our review of GAO’s standards for internal control, the Federal Acquisition Regulation requirements, and agency policies and procedures. The controls we tested are key to effective administration of the contract in that the lack of implementation would significantly increase the risk of improper payments or waste. To test internal control procedures over contract actions, we selected a stratified random sample of 102 contract actions totaling $140.7 million in fiscal year 2008. obligations from a population of 2,441 contract actions totaling $2.5 billion in fiscal year 2008 obligations. We stratified the contract actions by type of action, namely contract awards and contract modifications, recorded in CMS’s PRISM database from October 1, 2007, through September 30, 2008. With this probability sample, each contract action in the sample frame had a non- zero probability of being included and that probability could be computed from any contract action. Each stratum was subsequently weighted in the analysis to account statistically for. all the contract actions in the sample frame, including those that were not selected. Results from this statistical sample were projected to the population of contract actions made from October 1, 2007, through September 30, 2008. We also obtained information from agency officials regarding contract closeout, cognizant federal agency responsibilities, audit funding, and staff resources. See table 2 for specific details related to contract actions selected in the Sample. sample item. Table 3 provides further details on the control procedures we tested and the criteria or source for the procedure. basis for our evaluation of CMS’s contract management control environment. We determined that only basic contract information maintained in the PRISM database, such as vendor name and obligation amount, was reliable for purposes of this study. We used a statistically random sample selected to test the application of controls to also test the accuracy of the data in the systems. We assessed the reliability of the databases by performing electronic testing of required data elements and interviewing both CMS and HHS officials on quality assurance activities performed on the databases. of this report. The historical obligation amounts presented in the background section of the report come primarily from CMS’s PRISM database. We requested comments on a draft of this report from HHS and CMS. We received written comments on October 2, 2009, and have summarized those comments in the Agency Comments and Our Evaluation section ofthis report. Our response to certain specific CMS comments appears in the GAO Comments section of appendix III. We conducted this performance audit in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reported that the policy and criteria for pre-award contracting activities are already established in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service’s (CMS) actions are unresponsive to the recommendation. Neither HHS nor CMS has developed policies that clearly define key areas of authority and duties for the CFA responsibilities. HHS reported that they have implemented the Acquisition Career Management Information System (ACMIS) ACMIS is a centralized tracking mechanism that maintains training records for the personnel assigned to contract activities.
