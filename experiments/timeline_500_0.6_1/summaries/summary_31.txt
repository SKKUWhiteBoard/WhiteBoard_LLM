Vital Signs are pain oxygen saturation temperature heart rate respirations and blood pressure. The six Vital Signs are rated on a scale of zero to 10 with zero being no pain at all and 10 being the worst pain they've ever had. Here in a second I'm going to show you how to actually count the heart rate using the radial artery. I'm also going to go over how to take a blood pressure reading. I'll be back in a few minutes with the next Vital Signs video. Mark now we're listening for whenever it stops and whenever it stopped that's our diastolic okay it stopped right at 65 so his blood pressure is 114 over 65 so that is how you check bottle signs now whenever you're done remember to let the patient know what their bottle signs were and um do hand hygiene and clean your equipment before you go to the next patient so be sure to check out all my other videos on nursing skills and thank you so much for watching and for all your support.
