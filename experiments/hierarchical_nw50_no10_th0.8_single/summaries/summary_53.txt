Beginning in the 1930s, a number of federal housing programs have provided assistance to low-income renters and homeowners. In general, both HUD and USDA programs target families at lower income levels. However, these programs do not reach all needy households, and waiting lists for many types of subsidized housing, including housing for the elderly, are often long. A number of barriers inhibit coordination among agencies, GAO has previously reported. The federal governmentâ€™s system for providing assistance tolow-income people is highly fragmented.
