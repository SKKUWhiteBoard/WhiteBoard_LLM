in this video we're gonna talk about how a country can gain from exporting goods or services through international trade. We're gonna look at how consumer surplus producer surplus and total surplus are going to change when we introduced the idea of trade in allowing Chile's copper manufacturer producers to trade on the global market. The world price of copper is five thousand four hundred and forty dollars a ton. Because the world price is higher than the price in Chile Chile will export copper. There is a shift of some of the consumer surplus is going to go to the producer surplus. and sell that copper on the world market and so they end up exporting they endup exporting 1 million tons of copper to other countries. So we end up with this net benefit where we get this this whole new triangle which is producer surplus but it's increasing the total surplus. As a whole Chile is better off because it's exporting this copper and so we get a net benefit of 1.5 million tons. It's a new kind of triangle where we have a producer surplus and a total surplus, which is good for Chile.
