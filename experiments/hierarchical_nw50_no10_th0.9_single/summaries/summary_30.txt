Section 808 of the NDAA for fiscal year 2012 limited DODâ€™s total obligations for contract services in fiscal years 2012 through 2014. The limit does not apply to contract services for military construction, research and development, and services funded for overseas contingency operations. The spending limit personnel positions over fiscal year 2010 levels. Congress has also enacted legislation to help the department make more strategic decisions about the appropriate workforce mix of military, civilian, and contractor personnel, the authors say. They say DOD would still be in compliance with the law if total obligations were less than the aggregate limit.
