Professor Steven Smith: I want to talk today about Aristotle's discovery of America. He says Aristotle discovered the American Constitution 1,500 or 2,000 years before it was written. Smith: Aristotle's proposal for a mixture of oligarchy and democracy seems, in many ways, to anticipate James Madison's call for a government where powers must be separated. But Aristotle's mixed constitution differs from ours still in certain important respects, he says. He doesn't so much insist, as you will see in your reading, on the actual separation of functions of government. Aristotle's Politics is a book about the kind of knowledge requisite for political regimes. The great-souled person is the ideal recipient of this form of education. The gentleman may lack the speculative intelligence of a Socrates. But he will possess practical rationality, of practical judgment necessary for the administration of affairs, he says. The book was developed without any explicit reference to Aristotle, writes David Frum, in Berlin, Germany, in 17th century.. Anyone ever heard of Isaiah Berlin, the English political philosopher? the back door. On Friday, let me just remind you, Il Principe. We'll study Machiavelli. On this very partisan note I conclude. On Thursday, we'll study the life of the Italian statesman and play a game of chess with him. We're going to see how well he can play the game of poker. I'm looking forward to it. I hope you'll join us for the game on Friday night at 8 p.m. ET on CNN.
