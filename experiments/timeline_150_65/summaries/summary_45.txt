Iceland is one of the world's most active volcanic hotspots crafer has erupted 30 times in a thousand years and last blue in the 1980s. Scientists are now preparing to drill into it the is to learn more about how volcanoes behave so that we can better predict eruptions and also tap into a super hot source of energy. The plan is to drill just short of the magma itself possibly poke it a little bit the geothermal resource which is at Loc at the bottom of the volcano. just above the magma body we believe that is around 5 to 600° C just two ball holes of this kind could match the output of this entire plant. There is an obvious uh Game Changer and there's the exciting possibility a potentially Limitless cheap clean energy. This is a big part of how we are going to take geothermal to the next level and also of course a huge part in the green energy transition. At the University of Iceland lab work is underway testing materials to withstand extreme heat and pressure this is carpon steel. New materials and more corrosion resistant Alloys they're working with temperatures of up to 500° and corrosive gases. We have been focusing on highgrade Alloys nickel Alloys and also titanium Alloys but there's still one question I need to ask from the outside all this sounds you know just a little bit risky. Is it going to be safe to do this we believe that sticking a needle into a huge magma chamber is not going to create an explosive effect this happened in 2009 and they found out that they had probably done this a few times before without even knowing it. many other locations around the world where we have active volcanoes so this crazy sanding plan may actually have huge potential e.
