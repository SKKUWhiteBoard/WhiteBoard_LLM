VA pays monthly disability compensation benefits to veterans with service-connected disabilities. VA also pays compensation to some spouses, children, and parents of deceased veterans and service members. Congress established the Veteransâ€™ Disability Benefits Commission to study the appropriateness of VA disability benefits, including disability criteria and benefit levels. The commission is scheduled to report to the Congress by October 1, 2007. The average time to resolve an appeal rose from 529 days in fiscal year 2004 to 657 days in Fiscal Year 2006.
