The United States imposes economic sanctions on North Korea for activities related to weapons proliferation. North Korea is identified by the United States as a "jurisdiction of money laundering concern" The Government of North Korea also is designated as a state sponsor of acts of international terrorism. The sanctions quashes most U.S. foreign aid, trade, investment, and support in international financial institutions, authors say. The United States also could be subject to economic sanctions provided in three provisions of law addressing human rights conditions, they say. Concerns about North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons capability emerged in the 1980s. Through the late 1990s, the United States and North Korea engaged in negotiations. In October 2002, it came to light in negotiations that North Korea was pursuing a uranium-based nuclear weapons. The Six Party Talks collapsed in late 2008, and the Agreed Framework has not been revived. The U.S. and N. Korea are still in talks, but they have taken several steps back.. North Korea has engaged in a number of acts that the international community deems provocative. David Rothkopf: U.N. Security Council condemned attack on South Korean ship in 2010. He says President Obama assigned responsibility to North Korea for the sinking of the Cheonan. Obama's explicit identification of all features of North Korea's objectionable behavior constituting the threat is unusual, he says. Rothkapf: Each of these forms of objectionable behavior likely would be grounds, under current law, for restricting trade, aid, arms sales, and so on in the U.S. U.S. economic sanctions imposed on North Korea have the following impact: Trade is limited to food, medicine, and other humanitarian-related goods, all of which require a license. Arms sales and arms transfers are fully denied. Financial transactions are prohibited. U.S.-based assets are blocked for North Korean individuals, entities, and vessels designated by the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) North Korea is ineligible to participate in any government program that makes credit, credit guarantees, or investment guarantees available. U.S. trade with North Korea is significantly restricted because of that country's demonstrated pursuit of nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them. The Department of Commerce has treated North Korea a s a state sponsor of international terrorism, even in the period that the North Korean government was removed from the terrorism list, from mid-2008 through most of 2017. The Office of Foreign Assets Control, within the Department of the Treasury, must approve any U.s. importation from North Korea, and weighs all requests in the context of proliferation, money laundering, counterfeiting and narcotics trafficking. in violation of U.S. missile nonproliferation laws. Once a finding is made, the imposition of sanctions is mandatory, though sanctions may be waived if the President finds it "essential to the national security of the United States" The severity of the sanction depends on the type of material or technology transferred. North Korea is also subject to the economic sanctions provided in three provisions of law addressing human rights conditions. The sanctions imposed pursuant to these acts would be largely redundant, however, with penalties already prescribed to North Korea. The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) is administered by the Department of State. The first ITAR was issued on August 26, 1955. North Korea has been listed as a restricted country from the ITAR's inception. The President has the authority to change these regulations by removing North Korea from the list of restricted countries. The U.N. Security Council, terrorism, and policies that include arms embargoes and sanctions are cited as reasons for restricting arms trade with North Korea. June 26, 2008, when the Six Party Talks appeared to be making progress, President Bush determined it was no longer in the national interest to continue certain restrictions imposed on trade and transactions with North Korea. At the same time, however, he found that … the current existence and risk of the proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat. U.S. persons may not register a vessel in North Korea, obtain authorization for a vessel to fly the North Korean flag, or own, lease, operate, or insure any vessel flagged by North Korea. All property and interests in property of North Korea or a North Korean national that were blocked as of June 16, 2000, and remained blocked immediately prior to the date of this order. Designees include Kim Jong-un; and Executive Order 13810 of March 15, 2016 (President Obama; 81 F.R. 14943) of September 20, 2017 (President Trump; 82 F.R. 44705)—blocking property and interests in property that come under U.S. jurisdiction of designated persons and entities that operate in the DPRK's "construction, energy, financial services, fishing, information technology, manufacturing, medical, mining, textiles, or transportation industries" The President has the authority to change regulations, as long as those changes meet the requirements of any relevant law. He must also annually revisit his declaration of a state of national emergency; it expires if the President does not renew it. 2005, President George W. Bush expanded the authority granted his office to address the threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The 41 st President had declared that the United States faced a national emergency relating to weapons proliferation in 1990. Fifteen years later, the 43 rd President's executive order took additional steps to block property and assets under U.S. jurisdiction of any person found, in part ... to have engaged, or attempted to engage, in the proliferation. of WMDs. in activities or transactions that have materially contributed to, or pose a risk of contributing to, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or their means of delivery. This includes any efforts to manufacture, acquire, possess, develop, transport, transfer or use such items, by any person or foreign country of proliferation concern. At its outset, Executive Order 13382 identified eight foreign entities as contributors to proliferation, of which three were North Korean. The Office of Foreign Assets Control subsequently added North Korean entities and individuals to this restricted list. North Korea may reap as much as $500 million annually from counterfeiting, and another $100 million to $200 million from narcotics trafficking. The finding and initial proposed rulemaking had a chilling effect on Banco Delta Asia's international business relations. Some two dozen financial institutions across the globe have voluntarily cut back or terminated their business with North Korea, notably including institutions in China, Japan, Vietnam, Mongolia, and Singapore. President Obama also addresses money laundering and counterfeiting as one of North Korea's many objectionable behaviors to be deterred. U.N. Security Council has sought to protect DPRK's civilian population from the consequences of economic sanctions. Congress defers the broadest power to the President, in the National Emergencies Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, to curtail trade and transactions between the United States and North Korea. Congress authorizes the President to fine-tune the relationship with North Korea for foreign policy and national security reasons with each authority it incorporates. At the same time, Congress closely influences the President's choices by enacting legislation—addressing human rights matters or proliferation-driven issues.
