Grenade algorithm uses a minimal set of three-point correspondences to solve the camera pose estimation problem in the grenade formulation. The disadvantage of this particular formulation is that it ends up with a four degree polynomial which means that it could give up to a total of four possible solutions. The question becomes whether can we find the solution directly from any four point correspondences such that the solution is unique? The answer is yes and it was formulated by quan at all in a paper that was published in the 1990s. s1 we know that t5 here is actually a vector that is made up of the same entry but of different order so x4 x3 x2 x and 1 of different entry. We know that by observation any two elements the product of tij is going to be equal to tk and tl for this constraint to be valid where i plus j must equal to k plus l. We can substitute the respective components of t5 into this particular constraint to get this equation over here. equation we can stack them all up so one two all the way to six equations and we end up with a coefficient matrix with an a matrix of of dimension 6 by 5. in order for non-trivial solution to exist then this guy here better be of a maximum of rank four so what we can do here is that we can take the svd of a and this will give us u sigma v transpose where we simply the vector that corresponds to the least singular value in sigma. to the solution of s1 over here now it turns out that the same algorithm that we use to solve the linear four point and the linear five point can be applied to any number of point correspondences that is four or uh more points. Here we just need to solve for the svd of a m minus 1 multiplied by m minus 2 divided by 2 by 5 uh matrix of a to get the solution for the vector t 5 but the problem here is that the overall complexity is a cubic in the order of the number of points that is used to form a.
