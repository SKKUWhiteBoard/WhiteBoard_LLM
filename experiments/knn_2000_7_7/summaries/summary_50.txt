George Church: How do we deal with multisequence alignments? Church: This is using all the power that we developed for the pairwise comparison. This does scale exponentially with k. Church: There are very good for inferring structure or function from sequence without experiments. It's like doing a huge mutagenesis and exploring viable mutants, he says. He says the most non-polynomial calculations, that is to say, in this case, in the case of this band, you could take one of the examples and take it to the next band.
