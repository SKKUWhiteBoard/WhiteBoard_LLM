A random variable is a number that's produced by a random process. In physics, the number of alpha particles detected by a Geiger counter in a second is believed to be a random number. The number of faulty pixels in a monitor is also produced from an unpredictable randomness in the manufacturing process. The only time that C is not greater than or equal to 1 is when you have all tails, so there's a 7/8 chance, 7 out of 8 outcomes involve 1 or more heads. A random variable is not a variable, it's a function that maps the sample space to the real numbers. Usually this would be a real valued random variable. We have another concept of independence that holds for random variables that was motivated by the definition of independence for events. If I have an event A, I can package A into a random variable, just like the match random variable was really packaging the event that the coins matched into a [? 0-1 ?] valued variable. And it means everything that matters about event A is captured by the random variable IA. number of heads we can ask whether the event M, which is the indicator variable for a match-- the random variable M-- and the indicatorvariable IO are dependent or not. Now both of these depend on all the three coins. IO is looking at all 3 coins to see if there are an odd number of heads, M is looking to see whether they're all heads or all tails. And it's not immediately obvious that they're independent, but as a matter of fact they are. this can have value 0 and 1. If R is independent of S then R is really independent of any information at all that you have about S. If I have k random-- if I have a bunch of random variables, a large number much more than k, they're k-way independent if every set of k of them are mutually independent. And of course as with events we use the 2-way case to call them pairwise independent. We'll be making use of it in an application later when we look at sampling and the law of large numbers.
