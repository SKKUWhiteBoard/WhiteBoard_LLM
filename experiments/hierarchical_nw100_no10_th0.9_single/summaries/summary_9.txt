The Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act granted responsibility for managing marine resources to the Secretary of Commerce. The act also established eight regional fishery management councils, each responsible for making recommendations about managing fisheries in federal waters. In addition to these eight councils, NMFS has six regional science centers, which are responsible for generating the scientific information necessary for the conservation, management, and use of each region's marine resources. Since 1995, the Northwest Center has had lead responsibility for conducting stock assessments on Pacific groundfish.
