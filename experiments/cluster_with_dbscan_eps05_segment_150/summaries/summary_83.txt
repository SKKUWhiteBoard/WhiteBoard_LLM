- Hello, everyone. We're going to talk about deep learning software. This is a super exciting topic because it changes a lot every year. But as usual, a couple administrative notes before we dive into the material. As a reminder the project proposals for your course projects were due on Tuesday. And again, when working on assignment two, remember to stop your Google Cloud instances when you're not working to try to preserve your credits. For assignment two you really only need to use GPU instances for the last notebook. is really great for research. If you're interested in production deployment, you should probably look at Caffe, Caffe 2 or TensorFlow. PyTorch is a great choice. But it's a bit newer, has less community support, less code out there, so it could be a bit of an adventure. So it's kind of unfortunately, there's not just like one global best framework, it kind of depends on what you're actually trying to do, what applications you anticipate. The midterm will be in class on Tuesday, five nine. It'll be sort of pen and paper working through different kinds of, slightly more theoretical questions to check your understanding of the material that we've covered so far. And I think we'll probably post at least a short sort of sample of the types of questions to expect. So just, Yeah, yeah, so that's what we've done in the past is just closed note, closed book, relatively just like want to check that you understand the intuition behind most of the stuff we've presented.
