Turan's theorem is a foundational result in graph theory. It says that every n-vertex. graph G contains a clique on at least this many vertices. So here's the example. Let us take the n vertices and split them into equal parts. And there are r parts, so here in this illustration r equals to 3. And let's put in all the edges between parts, but no edge within a part. So this is called the complete r partite graph. minus 1 minus 1 over r times n. And this quantity here equals to r. So there's a strict equality sign here. In particular, G has a clique of size strictly greater than r, and that finishes the proof of Turan's theorem. Turanâ€™s theorem is a important and foundational result in graph theory. And it's a start of a subject that we now call extremal graph theory, concerning what can you say about a graph that has certain properties, like not having a large clique? In this video, we'll look at an application of the probabilistic method to graph theory. An independent set in a graph is a subset of vertices with no two adjacent. The Caro-Wei theorem says that every graph G contains a large independent set. We'll see an application and some ways to interpret this result.
