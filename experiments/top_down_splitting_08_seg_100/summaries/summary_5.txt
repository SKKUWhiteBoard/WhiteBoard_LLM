Bureau of Reclamation's Friant Dam on the San Joaquin River became fully operational in the 1940s. Since then, much of the river's water has been diverted for agricultural uses. A U.S. District Court judge has since ruled that operation ofFriant Dam violates state law. Parties agreed to negotiate a settlement instead of proceeding to trial on a remedy regarding the court's ruling. Full implementation of the Settlement would require congressional authorization and appropriations.. A key legislative issue is how to finance Settlement implementation. Other challenges are how to achieve the Settlement's dual goals of fisheries restoration and water management.
