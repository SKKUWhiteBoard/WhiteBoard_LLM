In fiscal year 1998, the Congress appropriated $25 billion in discretionary budget authority for the Department of Housing and Urban Developmentâ€™s programs. This represented a 30-percent increase over the fiscal year 1997 level of $19.3 billion. HUD provides rental housing assistance that enables about 4.7 million low-income households to obtain safe, decent, and affordable housing. HUD assists about two-thirds of these households through its Section 8 housing assistance program. In fiscal year 1996, HUD spent about $7 billion to provide tenant-based rental assistance.
