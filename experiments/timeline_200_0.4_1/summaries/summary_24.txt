HONG LIU: This is a key relation between the bulk and the boundary theories. The more you go to the interior of the space time, then corresponding to the lower energy process when viewed form the field theory. So the duality is that once you realize there's such relation, since the two sides are completely different objects, so the game is that you really have to do lots of guess work. Essentially, you have two sides if you want to relate things on two sides. HONG LIU: We have N equals 4 super Yang-Mills theory. And then here, you have type IIB string in Ads5 times ds5. Here on this side, there is a conformal symmetry which we explained before because this is a four dimensional theory. But being the right hand side, we still have some SO 5, S5. So this is more like a space time symmetry. And the isometry of S5 precisely gives you SO6. And we will not be explicit. You can also map the supersymmetry between them. guesswork is based on some very small clues. Good physicists do is that they can see non-ordinary things from ordinary things. So let me start with that relation. Related to the GS. GS string coupling can be considered as the expectation value of the dilaton field. The bulk field phi due to O has a boundary value phi 0. Any questions about this? Yes? AUDIENCE: Your choice of operator O should be consistent with all symmetries, right? HONG LIU: No. O can be anything. You can choose any O. and the field theory. And that also tells you that if you have a theory which due into a higher dimensional theory, and then that theory has a stress tensor, then this bulk theory must have gravity. So you can say, if any field theory is due to a theory of one higher dimension, that theory must involve gravity-- nothing about quantum gravity. Let's stop here. We're not going to get into quantum gravity right now, we're just going to talk about the theory of gravity.
