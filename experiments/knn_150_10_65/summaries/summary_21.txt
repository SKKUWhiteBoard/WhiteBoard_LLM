In this problem, we're given a collection of 10 variables, x1 through x10, where each i, xi, is a uniform random variable between 0 and 1. And we'd like to develop a bound on the probability that some of the 10 variables being greater than 7 using different methods. In part A we'll be using the Markov's inequality written here. And in part B, we'll use the Chebyshev inequality, which takes into account the variance of random variable x. a better bound. To remind you what a central limit theorem is, let's say we have a summation of i equal to 1 to some number n of independent and identically distributed random variables xi. We take the sum right here, and subtract out its means, which is E of the same summation, and further, we'll divide out, what we call normalize, by the standard deviation of the summation. As the number of terms in the sums goes to infinity, we will actually see that this random variable will converge in distribution in some way.
