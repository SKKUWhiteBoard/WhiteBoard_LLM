In r e Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001 , is a consolidated case that includes claims against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, several Saudi princes, a Saudi banker, and a Saudi charity. Plaintiffs argued that these Saudi defendants played a "critical role" in the September 11 attacks by giving money to Muslim groups, which in turn funded Al Qaeda. In August 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed dismissals of the claims against Saudi defendants. This report explains the legal bases for the dismissals and provides an update to the status of the case.
