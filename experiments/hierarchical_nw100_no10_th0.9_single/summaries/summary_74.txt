The department is facing near and long-term internal fiscal pressures. DOD has dominated GAOâ€™s list of federal programs and operations at high risk of being vulnerable to fraud, waste, abuse. DOD financial managers are responsible for the functions of budgeting, financing, accounting for transactions and events, and reporting of financial and budgetary information. The military services play a vital role in that they authorize the expenditure of funds and are the source of most of the financial information that allows DFAS to make payroll and contractor payments.
