Markus Klute: If there is a time dilation effect due to gravitational fields, then there's also a redshift which is of gravitational fields. He asks you to estimate the magnitude of this effect. You want to use the example of a 22 and 1/2-meter-tall tower. He says the speed of light is pretty fast, 3 times 10 to the 9 meter per second. And this distance is only 22 and1/2 meters, so we find that this is a tiny, tiny,tiny effect. to know more about this, you can, for example, look up a small description in Wikipedia here. But there's quite some literature on those experimental tests [INAUDIBLE] There's a lot of information on the subject on Wikipedia. It's a very interesting area of research. There's quite a bit of literature on it. It can be a very exciting area of study. It could lead to some very interesting results. But it's a little bit of a mystery as to how it works.
