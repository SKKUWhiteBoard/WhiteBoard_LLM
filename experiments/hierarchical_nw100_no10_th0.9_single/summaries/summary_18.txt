The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) was created to address some of the perceived regulatory weaknesses that may have contributed to the magnitude of the financial crisis of 2008. The council has a permanent staff with the ability to gather confidential financial information and the staff of the OFR are to be experts in the financial field. The FSOC provides a common forum for financial regulators to evaluate and address systemic risks that might emanate from less regulated non-bank financial institutions. It may set aside some financial regulations for consumers if the rules might cause systemic risk.
