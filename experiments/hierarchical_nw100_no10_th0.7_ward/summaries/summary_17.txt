to be increased to 437, the District of Columbia would receive one Representative. North Carolina would be entitled to fourteen Representatives, one more than the state is scheduled to receive in the apportionment following the 2010 census. Minnesota would retain its eighth seat and no other state would be affected by the change. Another way to see the impact is to examine the allocation of the last seats assigned to the states when the D.C. is allocated a seat (presumably the 51 st seat) Apportionment is done through a "priority list" calculated using the equal proportions formula provided in 2 U.S.C. §2a.(a) Table 2 displays the end of the priority list that was used to allocate Representatives based on the 2010 Census. The law only provides for 435 seats in the House, but the table illustrates not only the last seats assigned by the apportionment formula (ending at 435), but the states that would just miss getting additional representation. Table 3 is similar to Table 2 , in that it displays theend of the prioritized list. in that it displays the end of the priority list, but the last seat is 437 instead of 435. The priority values and the population needed to gain or lose a seat do not change if DC is treated like state, as DC is entitled the constitutional minimum of one Representative. In the U.S. Congress, the House of Representatives is made up of 435 members, with the Senate making up the remaining two seats. The Senate is the only chamber of Congress in which the entire House is elected at once. Table 1 shows the shift of 12 seats among 18 states for the 113 th Congress (beginning in January 2013) Table 1 also shows the impact on the distribution of seats in the House if the District of Columbia were to be treated as if it were a state for apportionment purposes for both a House size of 435 seats and a Housesize of 437 seats. These are the actual seats to be allocated based on the results of the 2010 Census. First, due to population changes between the 2000 Census and the 2010 census, Table 1 shows a shift of 10 seats. Second, if the House size remained at 435, the House would gain four seats. entitled to one seat, and Hawaii to two seats. Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Missouri each received one less seat than they would have if the House size had been increased to 438 (as was proposed by H.R. 10264, in 1962) Table 1 displays the apportionment of the seats in the House of Representatives based on the 2000 Census apportioning population. In addition, Table 1 also shows the impact of the 2010 Census on the number of seats for the 113 th Congress. the 2010 census, and the House size remained at 435, Minnesota would lose a seat relative to what it is scheduled to get as a result of the 2010 Census. Third, if, on the other hand, the District of Columbia were to be given a vote in the House of Representatives and treated as if it were a state, Minnesota's delegation would fall to seven Representatives. The House size was increased from 435 to 437 in the 2010 Census and Minnesota's delegation would fall to 7 Representatives. When Alaska and Hawaii were admitted in 1959 and 1960 the House size was temporarily increased to 437. This modern precedent differed from the state admission acts passed following the censuses in the 19 th and early 20 th centuries which provided that new state representatives would be added to the apportionment totals. In 1961, when the President reported the 1960 census results and the resulting reapportionment of seats in the reestablished 435-seat House, Alaska was entitled to one seat, and Hawaii to two seats. size of the House was imposed in 1929 by statute (46 Stat. 21, 26-27). Altering the size of the. House would require a new law setting a different limit. For the 2010 apportionment, a House size of 468 would have resulted in no state losing seats held from the 112 th to the 116 th Congresses. However, by retaining seats through such an increase in the House size, such a state would have kept its seats in the Congress. General congressional practice when admitting new states to the Union has been to increase the size of the House. At a House size of 468, California's delegation size, for example, would be 56 instead of 53 seats. Texas' delegation size would be 38 instead of 36 seats, and Florida's delegationSize would be 29 instead of 27 seats. New states usually resulted in additions to theSize of theHouse in the 19th and 20th Congresses. The current House size is 468. H.R. 157 / S. 160 provided for a permanent increase in the size of the U.S. House of Representatives, from 435 seats to 437 seats. The bills specified that one of the additional seats was to be allocated to the District of Columbia. The other seat would be assigned to Utah, the state which would have received the 436 th seat under the 2000 apportionment process. This would add a fourth seat to Utah's three. Similar bills had been introduced in the 110 th Congress. On April 19, 2007, the House approved H. R. 1905 by a vote of 241. version of H.R. 1433 ) by a vote of 241 to 177 (Roll Call vote 231) On June 28, 2007, S. 1257 was reported out of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs with amendments. cloture on the motion to proceed to consideration of the measure was not invoked in the Senate on a Yea-Nay vote, 57 - 42, leaving the measure pending. The 435 seat limit for the size of the House was imposed in 1929 by statute.
