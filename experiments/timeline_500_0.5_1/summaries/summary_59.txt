Adam Martin: How do you go from something you're interested in learning about an organism to actually identifying genes and mechanisms that are important for that? Martin: The two heroes of today's lecture will be the roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans, and the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. He also highlights a couple important vertebrate-model organisms-- the zebrafish and the mouse. Martin: Most of them are fairly small, and they're easy to house large numbers of them in a lab. Drosophila larvae has a segmental pattern that alternate between smooth cuticle and hairy cuticle. Because there's a lot of hairlike projections here, it reminded the researchers of a hedgehog. The hedgehog gene was the founding member of an entire signaling pathway, known as the "hedgehog pathway," that plays important roles in human development and also, human cancer. There are now a number of drugs that are being developed to target the hedgehog pathway, and one was approved back in 2012 for use in treating basal-cell carcinoma. Adam Martin: circadian rhythm is a behavior. We are awake during certain parts of the day and are asleep at night. If you're hidden from the light-dark cycle, you continue this cycle for some amount of time. Martin: There's something intrinsic in our system such that we want to exist on this 24-hour wake-sleep cycle. He says the Nobel Prize-winning researchers identified a gene called "period" that is associated with familial advanced-phase syndrome, which is a sleep disorder.
