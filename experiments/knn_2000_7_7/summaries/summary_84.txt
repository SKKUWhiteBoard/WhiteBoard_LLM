Part 3 in our series on distributed word representations. We're going to be talking about vector comparison methods. To try to make this discussion pretty intuitive, I'm going to ground things in this running example. On the left, I have a very small vector space model. We have three words, A, B, and C. And you can see graphically that B and C are pretty close together. And A is kind of lonely down here in the corner, the infrequent one.
