The zinc that goes into solution is 2 plus and 2 electrons. And the copper in the solution plates onto the zinc, plus those 2 electrons goes to copper like that. The zinc is leaving the solid and it's becoming 2 plus. But the thing is that now, you've got to be careful here. What about those two electrons? Where do they go? A zinc atom leaves its metal strip and goes into that beaker of zinc ions. But now you have two charges, two electrons on the strip because it left a zinc 2plus. need. So that's a real challenge for chemistry. I hope you guys have a great Thanksgiving and maybe hook up some different metals. And I'll see you all next week. Back to the page you came from.

Most energy storage needs are going to be around a year or less, he says. Grossman says electricity is more and more important in our lives. We'll go into batteries and then talk about the chemistry of batteries and throw in a couple of, why this matters, he writes..com/jeffrey-grossman/energy-storage-technique.
