The famous example was posed by Comte de Buffon back in the 18th century. It marks the beginning of a subject that is known as the subject of geometric probability. The problem is pretty simple. We take a needle that has a certain length-- l-- and we throw it at random on the plane. The needle might fall this way, so that it doesn't cross any line, or it might fall that way, and it ends up crossing one of the lines. If the needle is long enough, it might actually end up crossing two of the Lines. unit cube. So you throw points. Some fault inside. Some fall outside. You count the frequency with which the points happen to be inside your set. And as long as you're throwing the points uniformly over the cube, then the probability of your complicated set is going to be the volume of that set. You estimate the probability by counting the frequencies with which you get points in that set, and so, by using these observed frequencies, you can estimate the volume. It turns out that these days, physicists and many engineers use methods of this kind quite often and in many important applications.
