MRAPs generally incorporate a "V"-shaped hull and armor plating designed to provide protection against mines and IEDs. The Army and Marines first employed MRAPs in limited numbers in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2003, primarily for route clearance and explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) operations. As of July 21, 2011, 14,749 MR APs had been delivered to Afghanistan. Of this total, 8,100 will be the new MRAP-All Terrain Vehicle (M-ATV) designed to better handle the rugged terrain of Afghanistan.
