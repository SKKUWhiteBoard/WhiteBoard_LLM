In quantum mechanics, the spin of a particle with a vector is quantized, and in terms of its length and its components. You find that it's square root of f times s plus 1 in units of h-bar. The components, and along any axis, actually-- and in this case here, the d-axis-- have eigenvalues, and they are listed here. And we find that there is 2s plus 1 possible values. But the question-- it's an obvious question-- which axis is a sensible choice for this problem? physical state of particles, which axis are the right ones to choose-- or, sensible? There's no right and wrong in this discussion. If you look at the orbital momentum of a particle, that's given by r cross p, where p is the momentum vector of the particle. So now, if you're looking at the total momentum, we have to look add the angular momentum and the spin of the particles together. This, then, immediately gets us to a new definition, then of helicity. the same connection. The pion here is spin 0, and if you discuss this in the rest frame of the pion, the electron and the positron fly off in opposite directions, which means that the spin doesn't in align to 0. So that's why this is highly suppressed. It's not 0, because you can find-- you can put [INAUDIBLE] into a rest frame, where you're just basically looking at both particles from one side that was coming to you, and in that case, it's allowed.
