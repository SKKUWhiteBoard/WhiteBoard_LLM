Political philosophy is the oldest of the social sciences. It can boast a wealth of heavy hitters from Plato and Aristotle to Machiavelli, Hobbes, Hegel, Tocqueville, Nietzsche. The study of the great books or great thinkers of the past can easily degenerate into a kind of antiquarianism, into a sort of pedantry, says Professor Steven Smith. But these works provide us with the most basic questions that continue to guide our field, he says. "The ideas of John Maynard Keynes, both economists and political philosophers, when they are right, are more powerful than is commonly understood," says Smith. A regime indicates a form of government, whether it is ruled by the one, a few, the many, or as more common, some mixture of these three ruling powers. Regimes are necessarily partisan, that is to say they instill certain loyalties and passions in the same way that one may feel partisanship to the New York Yankees or the Boston Red Sox. Fierce loyalty, partisanship: it is inseparable from the character of regime politics. A regime is more than simply a set of formal structures and institutions, okay? It consists of the entire way of life, the moral and religious practices, habits, customs, and sentiments that make a people what they are. unnecessary or redundant. It would wither away. Political philosophy exists and only exists in that... call it "zone of indeterminacy" between the "is" and the "ought," between the actual and the ideal. This is why political philosophy is always and necessarily a potentially disturbing undertaking. Those who embark on the quest for knowledge of the best regime may not return the same people that they were before. But there is some compensation for this, I think. The study of political philosophy may be the highest tribute we pay to love.
