John ESSIGMANN: I measure my blood sugar at different times during the day. Gluconeogenesis technically means new synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors. The medicine I take is called Metformin. It has a number of targets, but one of them is one of the enzymes, called PEPCK, Pyruvate Carboxykinase, that's in the gluconeogenic pathway. The liver provides a constant stream of glucose to organs that absolutely require it, like our brain.

In this lecture, we introduce and develop the concept of independence between events. If I tell you that a certain event A has occurred, this will generally change the probability of some other event B. In such a case, we say that events A and B are independent. We will then proceed to define the independence of a collection of more than two events. Finally, we will close with an application in reliability analysis and with a nice puzzle that will serve as a word of caution about putting together probabilistic models.

No matter how gentle you try to handle your dough you will always de-gas it if only a little bit in today's comparison video we'll make 4 breads they will be made from the same dough but they will all be treated differently. The first one of the four breads will be left alone from the beginning of fermentation until it's baked. The final one will be folded shaped and degassed three times and we won't be fermenting them for the same amount of time.

Of the nearly 11,000 amendments proposed in the centuries since, only 27 have succeeded as of 2016. The founders of the United States were trying to create a unified country from thirteen different colonies. For an amendment to even be proposed, it must receive a two-thirds vote of approval in both houses of Congress. To actually change the Constitution, the amendment must be ratified by three-quarters of all states. The result of such high thresholds is that, today, the American Constitution is quite static.

The final contest, which is due tonight, is to design an agent that plays together with another agent to try to collect food pellets while not getting eaten by ghosts. Submissions for that, your last chance to submit are tonight at midnight. And on Thursday in lecture, we'll discuss the results. The idea behind these two lectures is to look at advanced applications. We will not quiz you on these application lectures, on the final exam, or anything like that. It's more meant to give you more perspective rather than extra study materials. Search is very prevalent in language processing, and we'll cover some of that on Thursday. Adversarial games. Learning to acquire behaviors. We'll look at some real robot behaviors in flight and in legged locomotion. And dealing with uncertainty. So AlphaGo. Today's state-of-the-art in Go is that there are computer players better than the best human players. But actually, if you went back to March 2016, that was not the case yet. And in what it did, we had to update this graph that you see at the very beginning of the course. CNN's John Defterios: How do you get a helicopter to do something like this? He says it's hard to stabilize a helicopter when you only know where you are up to a couple meters. Defterio: We set up a hidden Markov model, where we considered the state unknown. He says we can build a model for learning a bunch of parameters that predict the next state, and solve it at this point in the learning.to until this experiment was run. To learn more, visit CNN iReport. The helicopter uses roughly a fixed amount of fuel, anyway, per time. So it's more that it has less weight to carry as it has used more fuel. This helicopter had inverted slide, where it has more power, 3 Gs. It can generate three times the power of gravity. OK, let's take a short break here. And after the break,. let's do legged locomotion and manipulation. All right, let't restart. Any questions about the first half? Yes? is a separate linear feedback controller for each time slice. The way you learn that feedback controller is by doing a forward pass to see what your current sequence of controllers achieves. And then you can do a backward pass, which is, essentially, a value attrition pass over that same trajectory to find the optimal sequence of feedback controllers. If there is no wind, you can actually just run the linear feedback control. It will be fine. But if there's some wind gusts that could throw you off, you want to use the value functions and the two second look ahead against those value functions. The devil is really in the details, in the long tail of special events that can happen when you're driving. You can measure progress by just demo videos, which is one way, and it gives you some kind of feel for what's going on. Another way to measure progress is to see how are these cars doing relative to human drivers. It's 10 to the negative 5 events per 1,000 miles driven for humans. Red there is human fatalities. Yellow is human injuries. And then in green is the Google slash [? wave ?] mode disengagement. doing this. Early on, they were the only ones, as far as I know, but there's more companies now. And you can look at them on these plots and see which companies, how far along, in terms of how many disengagements they need per 1,000 miles driven. Still, so far, quite far removed from human accident rate levels. Another thing people have been pushing, as a consequence of all this, is lower power neural networks. So for example, Kurt Kuetzer at Berkeley has projects on this called SqueezeNet. If they're gigantic, use a lot of power. That's a problem. Let's see what we can do to build smaller networks to make decisions.

Mark was afraid well who knows uh may be different I don't want people know what I said in the past it might be unsafe. His view was that Charles II then had violated his trust and it altered the form of the Constitution and therefore the government was dissolved. and who does not have the right to vote and what the conditions on it are maybe we want to free it from that of course what I'm thinking of eventually um is that that that would be one motivation for introducing an idea like the origal position that say it's a way of conceiving how con power might be exercised. No point in criticizing someone for something they didn't intend to do okay well I think it's stop so remember there's no class here Monday so the next class here will be next Friday.

Summary:
David Kaiser: particle cosmology is a new subfield within physics. He says it studies the smallest units of matter, the fundamental forces and elementary constituents of matter. Kaiser: The field is doing pretty well these days by other measures. Its annual budget just within the U.S. is on the order of $1 billion a year, roughly, he says. It is really a booming, booming subject of study, Kaiser says. The field literally didn't even exist 45 years ago, he adds. Carl Brans and Robert Dicke proposed the Brans-Dicke theory of gravity in 1961. It was an attempt to modify Einstein's theory of general relativity in response to this challenge of Mach's principle. In Einstein's version, you can represent Einstein's general theory of relativity by an action, in a sense, by writing down a Lagrangian. It's the geometer's tool of quantifying the warping of space and the curvature scalar of time. The idea was that instead of having a single constant unit strength of gravity labeled by Newton's constant capital G-- that's the G that's in like Newton's force law. In 1961, Carl Brans and his advisor Robert Dicke suggested a new form of matter called phi. Phi is extended throughout all of the universe through every nook and cranny of space. As omega becomes large, the behavior reduces to the kind of constant strength of gravity of the original Einstein theory. The equations for the governing nuclear forces could retain all the fancy symmetries for which these new particles were introduced to reinforce that symmetry at each point in space and time. more than just the letter that they chose. There was a lot of what we might have considered similarities. And yet, the two sets of ideas really were treated so separately. By the end of the '70s, things did not look very good for Brans-Dicke gravity experimentally. In fact, Einstein's theory was not highly favored, and that's why everyone else started paying attention on the gravity side of the field. So we might wonder, well, was it changes in data? Did experiments force a new evaluation? two sets of ideas consider them side by side. The main story that's mostly given-- I alluded to this in the very beginning of today's class-- is actually hearkens to changes in ideas and, in particular, on the particle physics or particle theory side. These ideas are well worth appreciating. And they came in rapid fire in 1973 and 1974. The first of them is called asymptotic freedom. And actually, it's the reason why our friend and colleague here at MIT, Frank Wilczek, received the Nobel Prize. vast majority of those came really in the later '70s, in the wake of these pedagogical reforms. So remember that big report comes out in 1972. You start seeing curricular changes as early as '73, '74. By '75, '76, '77, you start seeing, in some sense, the market respond with many textbooks being really rushed into print. Some of these textbooks were basically mimeographed lecture notes. And now there's very, very fancy books published in a more typical way. In 1979, two separate theorists introduced a whole new model where they didn't only cite Brans-Dicke and Higgs, they literally united them. They proposed a new model in which these two fields were literally the same. Here they're coming along almost 20 years later to say, maybe there's actually the same field in space and time, with which other matter interacts. So there's a direct coupling between this new field and this hypothetical geometrical structure. And so you can think of it as like the balance of energy between the local curvature of space and so on. He wandered into this field really accidentally. He finished his PhD at Harvard in 1970. His work was squarely in particle physics, the fancy new symmetries and new nuclear forces. He then had a sabbatical early on in his faculty career, and he happened to go to Paris. He was basically in a stranger's apartment, reading the mail, just reading papers on the coffee table. And these looked really interesting. And in fact, they sparked. his interest in gravitation and cosmology. counts as natural can shift in a pretty short time scale. And as we've been seeing throughout the whole term and including today, those shifts can be driven as much by things well outside of the physicist's control, geopolitics, and national scale budgets. So that's where I'll actually pause. And we have time for a few more questions or comments. Any other thoughts on that? With my last moment here, I'll say, before the construction for the new Center for Theoretical Physics, I had an office just down the hall from Alan's. And by a quirk of the old building 6, we had the same key. soon, everyone. Soon, everyone will be able to play together again. Soon. Everyone will be playing together.soon. Everyone. Will be.

Summary:
Judy Hoyt: We're going to discuss the accurate control and placement of active dopant regions through a process called dopant diffusion. The placement of those regions determines many of the so-called short channel characteristics of MOSFETs that we'll talk about. The doping of other materials, not just the silicon itself, but of the polysilicon gate affects things like gate depletion and limits how well the gate voltage controls the channel potential, Hoyt says. The equation numerically, essentially, for an arbitrary doping profile is 1 over the integral of the carrier concentration minus the background concentration. In silicon IC processing, there are two different steps that we refer to in diffusion historically. The first step was so-called predeposition. And what this refers to is that you had an initial step in which the dopants were introduced into the silicon wafer. In the more modern technology, it's usually done by ion implantation, which is a process that we're going to discuss later and is covered in detail in chapter 8. The second process in creating a region of the wafer with a certain doping is typically referred to as the drive-in. This is a subsequent anneal after the pre-dep that then diffuses and redistributes the dopant. of cases where there are analytic solutions. We talked about the diffusion of a Gaussian profile with a fixed dose. We apply this diffusion to a constant surface concentration. And finally -- we talk about the diffusion of a complementary error function, which we apply for a constant level of surface concentration. The diffusion of this error function can be applied to a fixed level of surface concentration, or a constant level of substance on the surface, for example.

Summary:
Machine learning is about how to acquire a model and acquire the parameters of a model, from data and experience. In the next few lectures, we're going to work through a sequence of different takes on machine learning that are going to highlight different subsets of the big ideas on this topic. We'll see today exactly how data kind of goes through the mill and gets turned into a model. And we'll see more in-depth examples and more structured examples of these kinds of problems later on when we talk about applications. Machine learning can be used to detect diseases, fraud, and other problems. It can also be used for classification tasks like spam or ham classifications. The most widely-used application of machine learning is classification, but there are a lot of other applications, too. The next episode of Machine Learning with John Defterios will be on Monday at 10 p.m. ET on CNN. For more, go to www.cnn.com/machine-learning and follow John on Twitter @JohnDefterios. We're going to talk about model-based and model-free learning. Model-based learning involves building a model from our data, and then doing inference in that model to make predictions in the world. After today we'll look at the model- free methods. We'll also talk about how to learn the parameters of a models from data once we've decided it's structure. And then, the thing we'll mostly talk about today is how to teach a model to recognize a person. Spam detection is, in some ways, a very poor example of a canonical classification problem. Over-fitting means fitting the training data very closely, but not generalizing well. Under-fitting, where you're just like, I don't know what's going on, I'm just guessing randomly everywhere, is not going to work very well. Spam is being generated by people who are trying to defeat spam filters. And now you have spammers who are primarily looking at information or contact information. the thing we're trying to do is to fit a curve to this data. You can always fit your data more. It's about fitting your data to the point where the patterns that you are capturing are ones which generalize to test. This is definitely over-fitting. Over-fitting shows up not just on these continuous functions. It also shows up, for example, in a hypothetical digit classification, we might say, here is an image I've never seen before. Let's use Naive Bayes to classify it. So what would we do? We'd do our running total. over-fitting usually shows up as sampling variance. To do better, we need to smooth, or regularize, our estimates. How are we going to figure out what a random variable is? We can ask a human. You can go to a doctor and say, hey, I'm building a classifier. What fraction of people with meningitis will present with a fever? And a doctor can give you a guess, right? It may be qualitative. You could use training data. And this is basically what learning does.

CrashCourse U.S. history will be won by - Harry Styles in 2020. Future John Green tells you that in a stunning turn of events, Harry Styles will win the 2020 presidential election. We're going to change the constitution to make it possible. Because… that’s how much we love Harry Styles. The Wall Street Wamboozle, the Financial Fartstorm. The Major Recession of 2008 - 2012. The 2nd worst economic crises in the past 150 years. A mixture of public and private activities that tilted towards short-term economic thinking. Many Americans bought real estate assuming that its value would increase rapidly and forever. It turns out this was essentially a pyramid scheme and, my friends, I was not at the top of the pyramid. All this created a classic housing bubble, which was doomed to burst. The event that triggered the chaos was the failure of the investment bank Lehman Brothers in September, just 2 months before the presidential election. The Bush Administration tried to stop the damage by getting Congress to pass the Troubled Assets Relief Program, or TARP. Obama followed through on his promise to end the war in Iraq, although to be fair the Bush administration had really set him up for success there. He also authorized a successful military operation that killed Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011. Obama was fortunate to have a Democratic Congress for his first term in office, so he could push through a lot of legislation. The stimulus is estimated to have saved about 3 million jobs, but it also increased the deficit quite a bit. The Affordable Care Act is arguably the most significant piece of social legislation since Medicare. The 111th congress was one of the least productive in American history. Unwillingness to compromise precipitated a series of mini-fiscal crises over things like the budget and raising the debt ceiling. Meanwhile, the economy has slowly added jobs and looks halfway decent at the moment mostly because Europe looks so bad. The particular brands of ideological certainty that we see today may seem new but if you look at American history you realize that this has been going on for a long time. The Tea Party is right that the founding fathers would be astonished by the extend of the American government and the extent to which it’s involved in the lives of Americans. We have to ask ourselves again, “What does freedom really mean?’ Can you be free when the government can go to a secret court to read your text messages? We know that you can’t be free if you’re dead, so is the government’S job to protect you not only by having a standing army but also making you wear your seat belt? Crash Course World History has been on the air for two years. The show celebrates two successful years of teaching history. This has been one of the great professional joys of my life and I’m so grateful to everyone that has helped make the show and everyone who has watched it.

With AI we will see such a wide breadth of applications for instance these technologies have the potential to reduce and eliminate car accidents. We have three types of learning and you have seen different aspects of these methodologies throughout the course we have supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. There is so much opportunity for developing improved machine learning using existing models and inventing new models. If we can do this we can create an exciting work world where machines will really Empower us will really augment us and enhance us in our cognitive abilities and in our physical abilities. Just imagine waking up enabled by your personal assistant that figures out the optimal time and helps you organize all the items that you need for the day and then brings them to you. Just-in-time Holograms could be used to make the virtual world much more much more realistic much more connected. the kind of future that machine learning artificial intelligence and robots are enabling.

Summary:
HONG LIU: We have two sides if you want to relate things on two sides. And you have to do guess work. How does this quantity translate into that quantity, et cetera? And then check the consistency. So now let's talk about some further aspects of the duality. AUDIENCE: But being the right hand side, we still have some SO 5, S5. HONG LIu: I will talk about that. So this is more like a space time symmetry. So in N equals 4 super Yang-Mills theory. HONG LIU: In principle, the corrections beyond this limit can again be studied on the gravity side. In the classical string limit, still you can see the N go to infinity, which corresponds to GN. But here, the alpha prime can be arbitrary. And here the [INAUDIBLE] coupling can be arbitrarily. So let me just say alpha prime finite no longer zero. And then this is just corresponding to Lambda finite, which is no longer infinite. So this is a standard t Hooft limit. a general correspondence between some conformal field theory and some AdS gravity theory. HONG LIU: Yang-Mills theory lives on Minkowski space. And then you say you can imagine that this is the boundary, this relation is related to the bulk and the boundary. And this is a postulate based on that fact. AUDIENCE: So if it's a sort of postulate that's just thinking about it, it's not required that the theory live on the boundary of AdS. guesswork is based on some very small clues. Good physicists do is that they can see non-ordinary things from ordinary things. So let me start with that relation. Related to the GS. GS string coupling can be considered as the expectation value of the dilaton field. The bulk field phi due to O has a boundary value phi 0. Any questions about this? Yes? AUDIENCE: Your choice of operator O should be consistent with all symmetries, right? HONG LIU: No. O can be anything. You can choose any O. and the field theory. And that also tells you that if you have a theory which due into a higher dimensional theory, and then that theory has a stress tensor, then this bulk theory must have gravity. So you can say, if any field theory is due to a theory of one higher dimension, that theory must involve gravity-- nothing about quantum gravity. Let's stop here. We're not going to get into quantum gravity right now, we're just going to talk about the theory of gravity.

Bolek Wyslouch: How do you convert a given physical system with all the forces, et cetera, into some sort of fixed form, fixed type of notation? Bolek: We will work on two, again, simple physical systems, one that consists of two pendula driven by forces of gravity, each of them. And we will discuss various interesting-- even though the system is very simple, just two masses, a spring, a little bit of gravity on top of that. Complex notation is a mathematical answer, how to solve a mathematical equation. But the physics answer is to find fixed frequency modes us such that the system, the complete system, oscillates at one frequency. This is so-called normal mode. So I propose that-- so of course, we use the usual trick that anytime we have a solution in complex variables, we can always get back to real things by taking a real part. But what form of oscillation? OK, all kinds of complex numbers can write, but any particular-- could put it with me some spaceship, and go to a place where the gravity is different, right? Why not? So what would happen? So if gravity changes, then basically what will happen is both this term and that term will change. So let's try to see what happens on the Moon. It's a little bit not completely clear what's going on, but you see, actually the motion is kind of a little strange. Look at the red one. The red one is stopping. Then it's going halfway out. It looks kind of messy, doesn't it?

So I insulate the bar and I put it in the freezer. And I have an ordinary bar and an ordinary temperature. And the heat is escaping out the sides, so the end x equals 0 and the end f equals 1. And that's the solution.

James W. Swan: I hope everybody saw the correction to a typo in homework 1 that was posted on Stellar last night and sent out to you. We don't want to give you a homework assignment that's punishing. We're still going to talk about transformations of matrices. We looked at one type of transformation we could utilize for solving systems of equations. Today, we'll look at another one, the eigenvalue decomposition, and on Monday, we will look at the singular value decomposition. be stuck. It won't proceed after that. So it's the difference between getting a solution and writing a publication about the research problem you're interested in and not. So how do you do reordering? Well, we use a process called permutation. There's a certain class of matrix called a permutation matrix that can swap rows or columns. So if I want to swap columns, I multiply my matrix from the right, IP transpose. If I swap the rows and then I swap them back, I get back what I had before. James W. Swan: We discussed sparse matrices and a little bit about reordering and now permutation. He says permutation is a form of preconditioning a system of equations. He shows a simulation that tells us how probable it is to find the Plinko chip in a particular column. Swan: We could construct an alternative model that didn't have that part of the picture that we wanted to have. He's happy to answer questions on.at and he'll be back in a few minutes. For a real N-by-N matrix, there will be eigenvectors and eigenvalues, which are the amount of stretch. Eigenvalues are special vectors that are stretched on multiplication by the matrix. They're non-linear because they depend on both the value and the vector, the product of the two, for N plus 1 unknowns. So we can never say what an eigenvector is uniquely. We can only prescribe its direction. And that describes the eigen vector-eigenvalue pair. triangular form for this matrix. We'll talk next time about the singular value decomposition, which is another sort of transformation one can do when we don't have these complete sets of eigenvectors. You'll get a chance to practice these things on your next two homework assignments, actually. So it'll come up in a couple of different circumstances. I would really encourage you to try to solve some of these example problems that were in here. Solving by hand can be useful.

The Green Knight comes he says by there said one on the bank above his head and you shall swiftly receive what I once swore to give you and so he comes and pretty much vaults over the the brook over the river. The Knight addresses him they have a little back and forth and he gets ready to hit him. good person away with the forbidden fruit you know something similar we could maybe connect uh down the road but it's very similar to to those so um so go and the green. I hopefully you enjoyed it um really story-wise we're done with knights uh. It's a very similar story to the one we did with the knights. It was a very different story but it was very similar.

Summary:
Grenade algorithm uses a minimal set of three-point correspondences to solve the camera pose estimation problem in the grenade formulation. The disadvantage of this particular formulation is that it ends up with a four degree polynomial which means that it could give up to a total of four possible solutions. The question becomes whether can we find the solution directly from any four point correspondences such that the solution is unique? The answer is yes and it was formulated by quan at all in a paper that was published in the 1990s. s1 we know that t5 here is actually a vector that is made up of the same entry but of different order so x4 x3 x2 x and 1 of different entry. We know that by observation any two elements the product of tij is going to be equal to tk and tl for this constraint to be valid where i plus j must equal to k plus l. We can substitute the respective components of t5 into this particular constraint to get this equation over here. equation we can stack them all up so one two all the way to six equations and we end up with a coefficient matrix with an a matrix of of dimension 6 by 5. in order for non-trivial solution to exist then this guy here better be of a maximum of rank four so what we can do here is that we can take the svd of a and this will give us u sigma v transpose where we simply the vector that corresponds to the least singular value in sigma. to the solution of s1 over here now it turns out that the same algorithm that we use to solve the linear four point and the linear five point can be applied to any number of point correspondences that is four or uh more points. Here we just need to solve for the svd of a m minus 1 multiplied by m minus 2 divided by 2 by 5 uh matrix of a to get the solution for the vector t 5 but the problem here is that the overall complexity is a cubic in the order of the number of points that is used to form a.

Markus Klute: If there is a time dilation effect due to gravitational fields, then there's also a redshift which is of gravitational fields. He asks you to estimate the magnitude of this effect. You want to use the example of a 22 and 1/2-meter-tall tower. He says the speed of light is pretty fast, 3 times 10 to the 9 meter per second. And this distance is only 22 and1/2 meters, so we find that this is a tiny, tiny,tiny effect. to know more about this, you can, for example, look up a small description in Wikipedia here. But there's quite some literature on those experimental tests [INAUDIBLE] There's a lot of information on the subject on Wikipedia. It's a very interesting area of research.

In this video, we're going to compute some useful quantities for the exponential random variable. The CDF of x is the probability that X is less than or equal to little x. We use the standard formula, which is minus infinity to infinity t times fx of t dt. For this, if you evaluate the balance, 0 makes this 0, and 0 to get 1 over. And so the expectation is 1 over lambda, and so the variance is part c, so OK, so far so good.

Summary:
Professor: Can you explain the physical significance of the crystal momentum? Professor: The information about the momentum can be encoded in these spatial variation of the phase of the wave function. Professor: A central property from the Schrodinger equation is at the time variation d dt of p is equal to the expectation value of minus d the potential of x d x. The momentum expectation value is time independent, so it can be written in the form of e cubed, equal to e to the minus i upon h bar p l. can always write it as some q naught plus n pi over l. And so now really what's going to happen, what I'm doing here is I'm labeling q, not by a single number. And then we pick a different function, felicitously, called Phi sub q, which is contained in Phi q. So this is the potential. So in this statement that what we have this translation by x is just some function. It has to do with the potential of the wave function. So if we translate by nothing, then I construct a new function. Professor: When you have a perfect lattice, there is actually no current flowing in response to an applied electromagnetic field. Professor: You can build a system that has exactly a periodic potential. He says you can do it with lattices not of atoms, but lattices of dielectric. Professor: Optical fibers can be used to control the phase of the light that's shining through a glass fibers, and you can shine your light in a way that's reasonably well localized, and that's a lot of fun. beautiful block oscillations. And this has been proved in a very small number of real honest quantum mechanical systems. The most elegant experiment that I know of was done by Wolfgang Ketterle, who's here at MIT. And he got three data points because it was preposterously difficult and declared victory. But, the basic question is how robust is this. And the answer is it's not robust at all, but which you can tell because everything in the real world has enough impurity that it conducts. the induced electric field? Nothing. Any electric field that you send in will be opposed by an induced current. So this behaves like a classical conductor. You turn on an electric field, and the charges will flow to oppose that externally imposed electric field. You get charges then building up on the walls of your capacitor plates. So, this is where we have a conductor. Because there's an unfilled band. And back here , we had an insulator because we had filled bands separated by gap. The gap between the filled band and the next available band is actually called a band insulator. yeah. There aren't [INAUDIBLE]. But what would we need? What we need is one of two things. We need either the band gap coincidentally is ridiculously small. What's a good example of that? A free particle. In the case of a free particle, these band gaps go to 0. Right? And so that's a conductor. Just an electron. It conducts, right? OK. But that's sort of stupid. But a better answer would be, well, can you have a system where there are bands but you didn't have one electron per potential well? And yeah. You could orchestrate that in lots of ways. Photonic crystals have bands of allowed energy and gaps of disallowed energies where no waves propagate through. Photonic crystals form exact crystals that reflect at very specific wavelengths. So why would a butterfly put a photonic crystal on its surface? Well it's extremely light. It's fairly rigid. And it's like the best thing you could ever do if you wanted to be a shiny, fluttery, flying thing. OK. So that's it for band gaps. And I want to move on to the remainder, the last topic of our course. Which is going to be entanglement and quantum computation. give you one quick observation and then move on to the punchline of today. We've talked about identical particles before. And we've talkedabout identical particles in funny states. So for example, imagine I have two particles described by a wave function where the first particle could be in the state a and the second particles in theState b. And I can build aWave function for the first particles being in state a. And this tells us something totally awesome. But if I've taken these particles, put them in this entangled state, and sent one particle off to a distant planet, the second particle to my sister in DC, this should be yet another moment of serious discomfort. Einstein moved to Princeton in 1933. He left Germany in 1932 December, about three weeks before Hitler took power. He created a thought experiment which we're going to study in detail next week called the EPR experiment. And I want to share with you a really lovely description of the way the problem was represented in a way by-- this is from a book that I recommend to all of you. It's actually really hard to find. I was going to read you his actual quote. Now I'm just going to paraphrase it. stupid. He was Albert Einstein. But he was aesthetically incapable of pursuing this new physics in ways that were possible under the research possibilities of the time. And that is what I would leave you with. Physics is an aesthetic as well as an intellectual pursuit. So thank you all. [APPLAUSE] Back to Mail Online home. Back to the page you came from.

The question asks which statement by the patient is correct about this medication propano wal that they're Going to be taking. The answer is that the patient should take the medication every morning with grapefruit juice and monitor their blood glucose level closely. look and see why D is wrong this patient says that they're going to stop their beta blocker immediately if they experience cold hands and feet well this is a normal side effect with these non-selective beta blockers. You would never just immediately stop taking a beta blocker they need to be tapered off of this because if they just all of a sudden quit taking that medication they can go have cardiac death or something worse can happen so that answer is wrong for that reason okay so that wraps up this inlex practice question.

This is part 2 of a guide to clinical reasoning or how to create an accurate differential diagnosis from a patient's presentation. The patient is a 75 year old woman presenting with epigastric pain for four hours. She was in her usual state of health until four hours prior to presentation at which time she developed the onset of abdominal pain. The pain is relatively well localized to the midline in the region between her humble ankus and xiphoid process. There did not seem to be any particular trigger and the duration from initial to final pain was relatively short. The patient is a 75 year old woman with abdominal pain for four hours it is epigastric well localized progressed over 45 minutes is constant with no exacerbating or alleviating factors and associated with nausea from the rest of her history. She has hypertension diabetes moderate alcohol use smoking and is drinking water from a newly drilled well on exam. Her husband is concerned about contamination from a new well that was drilled on their property for drinking water one week ago on exam she is an elderly woman a piercer stated in moderate discomfort secondary to abdominal pain. The epigastrium would obviously be the most critical anatomic region to include organs that lie directly underneath it. The major structures are of course the liver and gallbladder along with other components of the extra hepatic biliary system. The spleen can cause pain with either a splenic infarct or splenic abscess. The chest referred pain to the upper abdomen from intrathoracic diseases is a common phenomenon organs in the chest to consider include the esophagus and the heart. and what that impact was that is obviously very tedious and time-consuming an expert clinician would probably start with the key features focusing on the ones that were either most prominent most unusual or those which clearly clustered together. Then thinking about which specific diagnoses were impacted by those features for the purposes of demonstration I'm going to take an approach here somewhere in between by going through each diagnosis one at a time but only mentioning those key features would seem particularly relevant so first up is gastritis the patient has some risk factors for gastritis with our alcohol use in smoking so these increase the probability of this diagnosis also gastritis can be associated with nausea. of diabetic ketoacidosis which can definitely present with acute abdominal pain and nausea in a diabetic however the normal metabolic panel which implies a normal glucose completely rules out this possibility. After all of this discussion what's our differential diagnosis to answer that we need to decide which combination of arguments for and against the diagnosis based on the key features results in the most likely possibilities. The most likely diagnosis for this patient is acute pancreatitis. pancreatitis is a relatively common diagnosis among patients presenting to the ER with abdominal pain overall this is a fairly classic presentation of a common disease.

Danqi Chen is one of the foremost researchers in question answering. She's particularly well known in recent work for her work on using dense passage retrieval methods for open domain question answering, and is the professor at the Princeton University. Danqi once upon a time was the head TA of CS224N. So she's quite familiar with the context of this class. So I'm very happy to introduce to you some of the fundamentals in this field, as well as on cutting edge and state of the art topics. if you just put your question in a search engine like Google. And those kind of systems are also able to handle more complex questions like how-to questions. So the question is, how can I protect myself from COVID-19? So there isn't really a simple and short answer to this question. So you can see that the system actually returns a very long paragraph, including the best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. So actually this paragraph is actually a summary from CDC article. So this is also one type of question answering problems. Question answering is probably one of those fields that we have seen the most remarkable progress in the last couple of years driven by deep learning. In this lecture, I will be mostly focusing on the text based, or textual question answering problems. And another class, bigger class of the question answering problem is called visual question answering. So if you have interest in these type of problems, I encourage you to check out those problems, but I'm not going to dig into these problems today. OK. Next, I'm going to start with a part 2, reading comprehension. If you remove the context-to-query attention, the performance will drop to 67.7 F1 score. And then if you remove this part, it will drop a 4-point F 1 score. So basically this theory tells us that these kind of attention scores can actually capture the similarity between the question words and the context words. And now here is our attention visualization to show that how this smorgasbord of attention actually can capture the similarities between the questions and the contexts. BERT is a deep bidirectional transformer encoder pre-trained on large amounts of text. It is trained on the two training objectives, including masked language modeling and the next sentence prediction. The BERTbase has 110 million parameters and the BERT-large model has 330 million parameters. If you just take this BERT model, and by just optimizing all the parameters together, it can give you a very high performance. And even if you use a stronger pre-training models, they can even lead to better performance on SQuAD. yeah, I guess I'm just a little worried about who comes up with the test cases? Who determines what the right answer is? I mean, we will have more discussion of toxicity and bias coming up very soon, including actually Thursday's lecture as well as a later lecture, not specifically about QA though. OK. Next person is-- Thank you for the lecture. Yeah, my question is also related to the open domain question answering. So there is some very specific designs like domain server alignments and efficient level disentanglement techniques that has shown some interesting performance on other tasks.

Um, and you guys will get to pick whether or not you wanna do your own construction project or, um, the default project. The assignments, [inaudible] are they limited to TensorFlow? asked the question if, if the assignment is limited toTensorFlow. If you have any questions about getting setup without feel free to use the Piazza channel. We also released a tutorial for how to just sort of set up your machine last week. Deep Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks are both used extensively in deep reinforcement learning. In 1994, we had TD backgammon which used Deep Neural Networks. And then we had the results that were kind of happening around like 1995 to maybe like 1998, which said that, "Function approximation plus offline off policy control, plus bootstrapping can be bad, can fail to converge" So I think it sort of really changed the story of how people are perceiving using this sort of complicated function approximation. Lemme just to clarify, if we set alpha to zero, what's the rule for selecting tuples among the existing tuples? It's a great question. Lemme just clarify. If you are fixing, um, uh, your w minus, then, if you were looking at our case that we had before, then you wouldn't be able to continue propagating that back, because you hadn't update yet, yet, that's exactly right. So there's gonna be this tension between, when you fix things versus her propagating information back. It's very computationally, expensive or impossible in some cases to figure out. could be super tempting to try to start, by like implementing Q learning directly on the ATARI. Highly encourage you to first go through, sort of the order of the assignment and like, do the linear case. Even with the smaller games, like Pong which we're working on, um, it is enormously time consuming. It's way better to make sure that you know your Q Learning method is working, before you wait, 12 hours to see whether or not, oh it didn't learn anything on Pogge.

In this section, we're going to talk about the relativistic Doppler effect. We make good use of our space-time diagrams, which we discussed earlier. The question is how is this being observed by an observer which is moving with a relative velocity v with respect to the source? So we have to apply Lorentz transformation. And we find then-- this is a little bit of an algebra exercise here-- that the period now is given by 1 plus beta over 1 minus beta square root of that times tau.

Political philosophy is the oldest of the social sciences. It can boast a wealth of heavy hitters from Plato and Aristotle to Machiavelli, Hobbes, Hegel, Tocqueville, Nietzsche. The study of the great books or great thinkers of the past can easily degenerate into a kind of antiquarianism, into a sort of pedantry, says Professor Steven Smith. But these works provide us with the most basic questions that continue to guide our field, he says. "The ideas of John Maynard Keynes, both economists and political philosophers, when they are right, are more powerful than is commonly understood," says Smith. see you back, and have a very good but thoughtful September 11^(th).

Summary:
Ahern: I have never had an exam where I had fewer questions. There were maybe 10 questions I got on the exam and that was for a class of this side. I find most students are honest. I've only had a handful of situations where in this class, where I've had dishonesty as an issue. The only students I've ever had with serious dishonesty issues actually were in smaller classes interestingly enough. But it has happened here and I do have taped evidence when it does happen. So that's why I do it. S1 proteases are a class of enzymes that are called serine proteases. They all have serine, histidine, and aspartic acid as a catalytic triad at the active site. It's very easy to alter the genetic code for any of these proteases and change which amino acid is presence at any given place. When they do that, and they compare the activity, so this is the log of Kcat. The wild type enzyme has an activity up here. One 10 millionth as active when that serine is changed to an alanine. Business of creating nucleophiles is not unique to proteases. One of these is an enzyme we've been talking about some already, that's the carbonic anhydrase. Students: Would you like a joke? Ahern: Yeah. Okay, so let's stretch. So this my, this is my magic genie joke, alright? This is not a computer joke. Depends on where you lean, I suppose. "This is really awesome, "I'm a really powerful guy. "I want every woman to love me." and poof, he turns into a box of chocolates. Carbonic anhydrase can catalyze the conversion of a million molecules of substrate into product per second. Most enzymes have a fairly narrow pH range where they work that's ideal. At pH 9, the enzyme is far more active than it is at pH 7, indicating that a very, very important step is the removal of that proton. The rate of formation of the nucleophile is the critical step in the catalytic action of this enzyme like that of the proteases that you saw before.

Summary:
RAFAEL JARAMILLO: Let's talk about intermediate phases and line compounds. He recalls intermediate phase in a three-phase system. He says the solution model becomes very narrowly shaped, like a pin. All possible common tangents are going to converge at the same point, he says. "I no longer need a solution model. I only need one point," Jaramillo says. 'I can't help myself. I got to draw the mouse-face plot' Magnesium nickel system has a number of different phases. At high temperature, this Laves phase develops some width. But when you drop down to low temperature, both of these intermediate phases appear as line compounds. These are very distinct structures, and they're only occurring at very distinct compositions. That's a hallmark of an intermediate phase. That is a line compound. Let's talk about compound formation energy. It is the free energy change for formation of 1 mole of compound from elements in their reference states. There's an infinity of examples of line compounds. Silicon tends to be a pretty useful additive for copper-based alloys. Doping semiconductors is why we're able to talk to each other over there. Without doping, there is no semiconductor devices, and no electronics revolution. So the fact that you can dope some metals into silicon is as important as the solubility limits can be in the parts per billion. It's a very famous line compound, so on the last P set, you're going to do some problems. RAFAEL JARAMILLO: Let's look at the silicon-carbon system at low temperature. Carbon here is a line compound. Silicon is not a compound, but it has zero apparent solubility of silicon in carbon. Carbon from carbon doesn't take any energy to form. Silicon from silicon doesn't. Take a stab at how I would draw a free-energy composition diagram for the. silicon- carbon system. Here's silicon. Here're carbon. And here's delta G. And let's say this is 50/50. RAFAEL JARAMILLO: I want to introduce this and get this in your minds. Let's imagine reacting metal M with 1 mole of oxygen to form an oxide. So zM plus O2 gas reacting to form MzO2. What's z? How do I determine z? Anybody? Does anyone know some oxides? Name for me a common oxide that you know. And these oxides are line compounds. That z is not a variable. We're going to use this property of being line compounds in Wednesday's lecture.

Summary:
A random variable can take different numerical values depending on the outcome of the experiment. Some of the possible numerical values of a random variable will be more likely than others. We will describe these relative likelihoods in terms of the so-called probability mass function, or PMF. The PMF is also sometimes called the probability law or the probability distribution of a discrete random variable. We use a subscript, X, to indicate which random variable we're talking about. And it has a probability. And in our case this probability is equal to 1/2.

Protein three-dimensional structure and its implications for the binding of small molecules such as drugs. How can we use these basic motifs to recognize other macromolecules, other proteins and nucleic acids? We have these motifs that we could find, weight matrices for them by aligning lots of sequences. Now instead of aligning sequences, let's see what we can do by mutating both the protein part and the nucleic acid part. And then we know from the three dimensional structure that it interacts mainly with the middle nucleotides. The topic today is proteins, and this really is the main contact between the exquisite regulatory mechanisms. Here, we need sensors to sense the environment. We need actuators to then deliver back into the environment what the cell wants to do or to interact with other cells. You have to have feedback, synchrony, so on that you can basically program the almost digital nucleic acid world inside the cell but via clearly analog inputs and outputs. We also-- I've listed some of the scariest proteins that I could think of. And we're going to talk about three of them. The way we program proteins is either transgenics, where we might overproduce the protein, or homologous recombination. But there are ways that you can program, and conditional, meaning you can regulate under what conditions the protein is expressed or not or active or not with an entire domain, or with single nucleotide polymorphisms. In the case of the zinc finger, we made an altered specificity. We made new zinc fingers with bind to completely new trinucleotides. With the DNA polymerase, by changing one amino acid, we could make it now accept almost four logs better. Solid phase comes up again and again in arrays. It's very obvious why you have a solid phase. You want to be able to address it by its positions in x and y on the array. But the other reason-- technical reasons are, it's a fantastic way of getting purification of your products simply by washing. And it allows you to, in the case of beads, there now-- you can think of it as an ultimate and flexible array. You can move the beads around and put them in new arrays, and identify them later. Protein synthesis is a completely synthetic way of getting short peptides. You can think of these as drug-like molecules. These are naturally related-- they can be analogs of nucleic acids and proteins. And we'll talk about opportunities for making these analogs. A large class of pharmaceuticals, including most of the antibiotics, are made by a fairly small class of organisms, streptomyces in certain plants. And this process by which it's made in more detail, is very akin to fatty acid synthesis.

Sadhana sadhana is a machine learning scientist at Themis Ai and the lead TA of the course intro to deep learning at MIT. She'll be teaching us more about specifically the bias and the uncertainty of AI algorithms which are really two key or critical components towards achieving this Mission or this vision of safe and trustworthy deployment of AI all around us. Sadhana will talk about how we can build very modular and flexible methods for AI and building what we call asafe and trustworthy Ai. behalf of Themis so over the past decade we've seen some tremendous growth in artificial intelligence across safety critical domains in the Spheres of autonomy and Robotics. A lot of these Technologies were innovated five ten years ago but you and I don't see them in our daily lives so what is what's the Gap here between Innovation and deployment. We'll talk about how Themis is innovating in these areas in order to bring new algorithms in this space to Industries around the world after we talk about the ramifications for this for real world AI. lecture so so far we've been focusing mainly on facial recognition systems and a couple of other systems as canonical examples of bias. bias is actually far more widespread in machine learning consider the example of autonomous driving many data sets are comprised mainly of cars driving down straight and sunny roads in really good weather conditions with very high visibility. In some specific cases you're going to face adverse weather bad um bad visibility near Collision scenarios and these are the samples that are the most important for the model to learn. epistemic uncertainty let's go back to our real world example let's say the again the input is the same as before it's a RGB image of some scene in a city and the output is a pixel level mask of what every pixel in this image belongs to. We can use bias and uncertainty to mitigate risk in every part of the AI life cycle. analyzing the data before a model is even trained on any data we can analyze the bias that is present in this data set and tell the creators whether or not they should add more samples.

HONG LIU: So if you want to compute, say, some scattering amplitude from alpha to beta-- so alpha's some initial state and beta's some final state. Say alpha consists of momentum p1 and PN-- or pm, and beta, say momentum p m plus 1 and pn. And then you can get this scattering amplitude just by taking your momentum-space correlation function, OK, for the n points. So this is obtained by doing a Fourier transform. So any questions on this? Yes? AUDIENCE: So can you explain again why this diagram, like, you have one branch and then there's a loop? The Dirac equation is one of the most beautiful equations in mathematical physics. It's actually describing electrons, so it's not only beautiful, but it's actually useful. The most general way to write it is to try to write the first-order equation which is Lorentz invariant. When you go to a different frame, the equation looks the same. Just different observers in different laboratory, that's what we mean by the equation of the Lorez transformation transform to be Lorez covariant. HONG LIU: I know some people develop psychological fears for fermions because you have to deal with those gamma matrices, OK? For a long while, actually, I have this psychological fear myself. But these are beautiful objects if you get used to them. OK, so now I will denote-- introduce a new notation so that it looks nicer. I'll denote the gamma 0 equal to i beta and then the gamma i equal to  i times beta alpha i. And then let's all pull it to the same side, and then this becomes the following equation.

Jake Xia: This is the second time we are having this class. The purpose of this course is really to give you a sampling menu to see how mathematics is applied in modern finance. We will be doing a bit more polling along the way, mainly to get feedback of how you feel about the class. And so hopefully, this will give you enough information to decide this is a field you would like to pursue in your future career. The class will be held every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon from 2:30 to 4:00. Brokers take principal risks, market makers match trades and earn commission. Hedge funds find opportunities to profit from inefficient market positioning or pricing. Private equity funds look to invest in companies and either take them private or invest in a private equity form to improve the company's profitability. Government always have a very large impact on the market, because they are the policymakers. The beta and alpha, the concept comes in. If you're a portfolio, some people don't worry about buying stocks. But if you want to beat the S&P 500 index fund, you have to beat that index fund. Risk management, nowadays, becomes pretty widespread responsibility. It's not just the corporate treasury's responsibility. Even if you are not a finance guy, you work in a corporate, you just do you import, export, or building a factory, you have to know, actually, what the exposure is. Let's talk about market making. If it's a simple transparent product, everybody pretty much knows where the price is. So, if you buy Apple stock, I think a lot of people know pretty much where it is. that liquidity, and then takes the risk. They manage the book by balancing those Greeks, which I mentioned earlier. Delta, which describes the relationship of this whole book to the underlying stock, or underlying whatever currency. That's called delta. Gamma is really the change of the portfolio. Take the derivative to the delta, or the underlying spot. So, that's second-order derivative. Delta is the first order. So gamma, now you have curvature or convexity coming in. And theta is really-- nothing changes in the market. Nothing changes in your position. Vasily Kuznetsov: Arbitrage is really to find the relationships between prices, and try to profit from those relationship mispricing. He says the systematic trader builds computer models. Kuznets: Math is very useful in risk management, which I will give you some quiz -- questions -- to test your knowledge of the market. He adds that math plays a very important role to quantify how much exposure you have to the risks you have in your bank account or in the stock market. Prof. Jake Xia: "I just want to give you the sense how math and intuition and judgment can come into the same place" "When you go to the market, you buy a stock. When the stock goes up, makes bit of money, the natural tendency is to let's take profit," he says. "If you have the discipline to get out, that's great. Trading is really all about how do you risk manage," he adds. "I'm not trying to tell you which one is right or wrong, but think about it" your bank account balance is-- let's say you are a freshman student. Your choice will be very different from someone has $100,000 in his bank account. And also, your risk tolerance, how much you can tolerate. Math is very powerful and useful in finance. So learn the math, learn the finance first, but keep those questions along the way when you are learning during this class. So suggested homework, optional. Go to the course website, read what we have put up for the financial glossary. every time. So, if you want to differentiate this functions and get a derivative, then this derivative will be quite noisy. And so, instead of getting the true derivative, you might obtain something quite different from true derivative just because there is a confidence interval around any point. So obviously, there is somewhere balance, and the question was, is there an optimal shift size to get the derivative? And that's what-- uh oh, the slide got corrupted. There was an answer. And we are implementing it in our systems and plan to use it in practice. what we had, we had the noisy observation of broker data and it was coming out at different non-uniform times. So, we decided to use Kalman filter and to study how it can predict. And that's one of the nice graphs [INAUDIBLE] produced, which again, we will use this strategy and the Kalman filters which he constructed in our e-trading platform in Moscow. Just to remind, the website is fully functional. We will be posting a lot of materials there. Probably most lectures will be published there.

Summary:
Adam Martin: How do you go from something you're interested in learning about an organism to actually identifying genes and mechanisms that are important for that? Martin: The two heroes of today's lecture will be the roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans, and the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. He also highlights a couple important vertebrate-model organisms-- the zebrafish and the mouse. Martin: Most of them are fairly small, and they're easy to house large numbers of them in a lab. Drosophila larvae looks like. And you can see it has a segmental pattern here. But you see there are these segments that alternate between smooth cuticle and hairy cuticle. And because there's a lot of hairlike projections here, it reminded the researchers of a hedgehog, and so this mutant became known as "hedgehog" The hedgehog gene was the founding member of an entire signaling pathway that plays important roles in human development and also, human cancer. There are now a number of drugs that are being developed to target the hedgehog pathway. Robert Horvitz won the Nobel Prize for his work on how cells decide what fates they give rise to. His lab at MIT studied the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, which has 947 somatic cells. 131 cells, during the development of this animal, underwent programmed cell death. This is not random cell death; it's the same cells every time. A mutation that affected cell death that blocked this process is called ced-1. And what you see in this worm is a bubble-like structures that are dead cells but haven't been engulfed.  defects in the genes that were identified in Drosophila actually are relevant to human sleep disorders. So this screen identified a gene called "period" This is a gene. And there's a hammer log of the period gene in humans. And the gene in human is associated with familial advanced sleep-phase syndrome. So these mutants that the Benzer Lab identified had altered period of the sleep-wake cycle, and therefore, the gene was named "period." All right, I'm all set.

In this chapter we will discuss two applications, one price control and second taxation, so right. Sir, does this slope of this graph denote anything price demand upon, some price upon some quantity? So, wait little later we will talk about that that topic, right now we are just talking about movement and shifts, the direction of movement. We are not talking about the slope. So, what is price control what do we mean by price control? Price control is how we can regulate the prices of the goods in the market. When we have a price floor, we get excess supply then you have non-market rationing mechanism. Like the payment is not done at the time of buy, it is done after year or after few months. And one more thing we have to pay a minimum wage to the laborers. So, all these things happen whenever we have price control. But I am not saying that price control does not have advantage that when we talk about the welfare economics towards the end we will talk about it. But what I am saying definitely that there are definitely better ways to cater to the welfare of public.

Exonucleases might end up chewing up your transcript, but that probably suggests that the messenger RNA has been retired and it's going to retire to a better place. And this, once again, plays other functional roles with respect to being recognized as a transcript and helping to get out of the nucleus of the cell. "I think this field is fascinating. Once you get used to the mechanics of it, it's really cool to think of how you go from DNA to RNA to folded proteins," he says. "Don't forget my office hours on Monday if you need them," he adds. "I'll be in the lab all day, every day, if you want to talk to me about it." "I've got a lot of questions for you," she says, "but I'll be happy to answer them."

Summary:
Professor Donald Kagan: We are living in the early years of a polis sometime in the eighth century B.C. The date that's typical for the general phenomenon of colonization coming out of the mother cities of Greece is 750 roughly. The earliest date according to Greek tradition, if my memory is correct, was something like 773 where the Greeks date the foundation of what they thought was the earliest colony they ever established -- a place that they called Pithaecusa, which is the island of Ischia. will decide whether it's a good idea for him or not. Recruiting is tremendously important because you need to have a certain number of settlers to make the settlement viable. So however many that is, that is what you try to recruit and you recruit typically at a time when it's easy to get people together so you can tell them the story. The best time would be at some great festival. There are festivals held in each city just for its own citizens and my guess is that when you could do that, when you felt that you could recruit a full colony from your fellow citizens in Corinth, that's what you did. Syracuse is an independent polis, autonomous, self-governing, whatever regime it wants. It is not a subject of anybody, not Corinth or anybody else. Corinth sent out a lot of colonies, which is why we know something about their arrangements. At the other end of the spectrum it's again Corinth and they have a colony called Corcyra. The first battle between them is a navel battle and thereafter we hear of quarrelling and fighting. It's been around for a while, while a while for a colony, very early times. More time, that the overwhelming normal situation is the first one I described, friendly relations. These guys that have gone out, let us say to Syracuse, they are your people, they have relatives back home. It is natural--oh by the way, they're accustomed to worship the gods in the same way that the Corinthians do. We do know, again, Thucydides is our source, that it was customary for colonies to send representatives back to the mother city for the religious observations that were common to them all. Kagan: The question is who gave permission for a colony to go in the mother city. The best guess and that's the only thing we have. These would have been aristocratic republics at this stage of the game. Kagan: Nobody was compelled to do anything. Everybody--all of this is voluntary on both sides of every agreement. The British practicing mercantilism passed navigation acts, saying what ships could carry what and so on--nothing like that in the Greek world. By the tenth century B.C., we see Greek cities lining the coast of Asia Minor on the west, and even around on the bottom and to some degree on the north, and on the islands in the Aegean. So, there has been a Greek--what's the word I want? There is an expansion of the Greek world already by the 10th century. The way the Greeks did their immigration into Asia Minor actually had a pattern so that you can go from north to south and you will find some consistency. More and more people would be making their living in a way that was not agricultural. They would be in commerce and industry in this small sense and doing all the various things that are not farming. So you now have classes or groups of people who have interests rather different from those of the most primitive polis you could imagine. Some scholars early on in the century, moved by Marxist theories, suggested that you had a capitalist class growing up, there's just no evidence of that. My guess is that the earliest traders of any scope were probably noblemen who also had land and estates back home. way has to be found to fit them in because, as I say, they don't fit. That creates trouble. As we shall see very shortly, that trouble often takes the form of first of factional struggles within the aristocracy, which then after awhile come to involve people outside the aristocracy. So that's the, what you might say, is the negative side of the story. But colonization, especially, some scholars have pointed out, I think persuasively, also for some considerable time provided an answer to that problem. that colonization provided something analogous to that for the Greek people. So now, here we are somewhere in the seventh century, most of these places I've been talking about have been settled, the currents that I have been describing are flowing and the kinds of problems they have give rise to what will be felt in most of the towns. That is the proper introduction to the next topic, which I'll discuss next year. No not--it seems like a year, but it's next Tuesday actually.

Sir Gawain, nephew of King Arthur, was invited to a party at Camelot. A towering knight riding an emerald steed burst into the room and proposed a game. The Green Knight declared he would allow the bravest warrior present to attack him with his own axe. If they could strike him down, they would win his powerful weapon. However, the knight would be allowed to return that blow in one year and one day. Gawain tried to forget this bizarre vision, but despite the strangeness of the knight’s game, he was determined to act honorably.

Summary:
well welcome back everybody to uh the last lecture 162. this is kind of a a special lecture um i did get some requests for more information about distributed storage and quantum computing and so i think we're going to do that. i want to make sure that we talk through the chord algorithm since that's a i think relatively simple thing to understand and is uh very cool and applied pretty much everywhere. At the very end of uh last lecture we were talking about key value stores and uh the cool thing about keyvalue stores is they're very simple in interface excuse me. Security is basically computing in the presence of an adversary so i'm assuming several of you have all taken 161. Security is basically using those mechanisms to prevent misuse of resources so for instance virtual memory is a mechanism that can be used for protection. One of the questions that's important is do you know where your data came from that's a provenance question. Data integrity is making sure that the data read only by authorized users so that's an important thing. Non-repudiation is a surprisingly important thing that people don't often talk about. how we want to be dealing with data all right sorry if that's a lot of information but i wanted to see if there's any questions there before i switch over to some quantum computing all righty give me a second i'll be right back. So first question is how do we know the data is secured so um just like with a blockchain let me just back up to the picture here which i think is a is a good one to be talking about um what we know is the following. The vision here really is of pretty much everybody using data capsules everywhere okay and if you can get that to happen then you could potentially have a very interesting scenario here. We're working with roboticists and machine learning folks to put their data and their models for grasping and so on inside of data capsules and as a result they can reside securely in the edge in say your robots or whatever in a way that can't be breached. If any of you want to come work on this project come talk to me uh separately we have plenty of places we can talk to you. me i'm going to show you shores factoring in one slide so this is something that would break rsa okay we can basically say the difficulty of factoring rsa is figuring out how to take a large number which is publicly known and factor it into two large factors that are primes. If you can do that you break the cryptography so classically this is an exponential time algorithm and so as long as these are big enough nobody's going to break it quantum computer can do it polynomial time. question is is this something to worry about the answer is well so far no but it's looking like um it's getting closer and closer okay. We actually investigated ways of optimizing that and we could actually look at performance of different options for the shortest factoring algorithm as quantum circuits. So we built a cad tool to do that so um i i don't know i think it's a pretty interesting area right now and there's a lot of interest in it all right so um sorry i kept you guys way over but this is the last lecture i figured if anybody was interested we talked about key value stores.

Summary:
So in the next portion of today's lecture we're going to talk about how we can modify the policy gradient calculation to reduce its variance. In this way we'll obtain a version of the policy gradients that can be used as a practical reinforcement learning algorithm. The first trick that we'll start with is going to exploit a property that is always true in our universe which is causality causality says that the policy at time t prime can't affect the reward at another time step t if t is less than t prime. different policy parameters you'll have one value of the baseline for parameter one a different value for parameter two. In practice we often don't use the optimal variance we just uh sorry we typically just use the expected reward but if you want the optimal baseline this is how you would get it all right so to review what we've covered so far we talked about the high variance of policy gradients algorithms. We talked about how we can lower that variance by exploiting the fact that present actions don't affect past rewards and we can use baselines which are also unbiased.

Summary:
Today we're gonna talk about learning in the setting of games. What does learning mean? How do we learn those evaluation functions that we talked about? And then, er, towards the end of the lecture, we wanna talk a little [NOISE] bit about variations of the game- the games we have talked about. So, uh, how about if you have- how about the cases where we have simultaneous games or non-zero-sum games? And an example of that is rock, paper, scissors. Can you still be optimal if you reveal your strategy? So, so that's kind of how we do it. We call these policies. We get a bunch of episodes. We go over them to make things better and better. So then we generate episodes and then from these episodes, we want to learn. These episodes look like state action reward states and then they keep going until we get a full episode. And then we had a target that you're trying to get to. And my target, which is kind- kind of acts as a label, is going to be equal to my reward, the reward that I'm getting. Is it possible to have, an end state and not end state have the same feature vector, or no? If you use like, uh, initialize rates do not be zeros which you update throughout instead of just to the end. If there were kind of the same and have same sort of characteristics, it's fine to have feature that gives the same value. If it is always 0, it doesn't matter like what the weight of that entry is. So in general, you wanna have features that are differentiating and you're using it in some way. Minimax sca- strategy seemed to be pretty okay when it comes to solving these turn-based games. But not all games are turn- based, right? Like an example of it is rock-paper-scissors. You're all playing at the same time, everyone is playing simultaneously. The question is, how do we go about solving simultaneously, okay? So let's start with, um, a game that is a simplified version of rock- paper-sc scissors. This is called a two-finger Morra game. look at them, would be useful for projects. And with that, I'll see you guys next time. Back to the page you came from! Back to Mail Online home.

The famous example was posed by Comte de Buffon back in the 18th century. It marks the beginning of a subject that is known as the subject of geometric probability. The problem is pretty simple. We take a needle that has a certain length-- l-- and we throw it at random on the plane. The needle might fall this way, so that it doesn't cross any line, or it might fall that way, and it ends up crossing one of the lines. If the needle is long enough, it might actually end up crossing two of the Lines. that these days, physicists and many engineers use methods of this kind quite often and in many important applications. The method is used in a variety of scientific and engineering applications.

Summary:
Professor: We're describing interaction between the electromagnetic field and atoms. He says the problem of resonance can be "fixed" by adding an imaginary part to the energy level. Professor: I want to show you what are the tools to treat those infinity source divergences in a consistent and a systematic way. He explains how to calculate the Fourier transform of the time evolution operator to infinite orders, and how to sum up an infinite number of diagrammatic tricks and summation. The course is part of MIT OpenCourseWare, which offers free online classes. Professor: In general, a real part and imaginary part. It's a function of the initial energy E. And it has an imaginary part, and it's the same if you have the function 1 over x. The imaginary part gets us Fermi's golden rule. And the real part has actually-- remember when we discussed the AC Stark shift. The AC Stark Shift has a 1 over [INAUDIBLE] dependence. So this is actually nothing else than theAC Stark shift not due to a laser beam, but due to one photon per mode. we calculate here-- has no resonant structure at the energy Eb. So therefore, we can neglect the energy dependence of that and simply replace the argument E by the energy we are interested in, namely energies close to Eb. This replace, neglect E and set, or replace the dependence by E, by taking the value at Eb. And we obtained, as promised, the imaginary part, which we can approximate by Fermi's golden rule. If we now Fourier transform back and obtain the time evolution of this state, it no longer evolves with theenergy Eb. It has a shifted energy by this self energy. And this is called the radiative shift. But in addition, because of the imaginarypart, it has now an exponential decay. Damping is a consequence of the fluctuation dissipation principle. We do not get any form of damping without at least the fundamental quantum noise. The tool which we use for that is the density matrix. The density matrix can be written as a probabilistic sum over states. This will actually play a major role. We will make certain models for damping. And it's really beautiful. On Monday, I will give you the beam splitter model for the optical Bloch equation. Because it's a microscopic model. processes. OK, any last questions?

Summary:
David KAISER: Today, we're going to pick up where we were on the most recent classes. We'll look at the coalescence of what came to be called the Big Bang model. And then we'll see how cosmic inflation emerged from that particular moment to try to address some of the shortcomings while retaining some the successes. And the asterisks are to remind you there's a set of strictly optional lecture notes on the Canvas site which go into a little bit more detail of some of these parts from the lecture. In the early universe, charged particles had a mean free path to cross the dance floor. Gamov, Alpher, and Herman were putting real numbers to try to make sense of these different phases of the very early universe. Very high temperature, early dense state should be qualitatively different in its behavior than a later lower energy state. They predicted as early as 1948 that there should be this remnant glow from the Big Bang, all those photons that only then at 380,000 years after the Big bang were able to start streaming freely. 20 years later, two radial physicists working at Bell Labs, Robert Wilson and Arno Penzias, were using a new horn antenna sensitive to radial microwave and radial band frequencies. This should've been among the most precise instruments available on the planet for that band of the spectrum. They couldn't get rid of a residual hum. At one point, they climbed inside that huge horn antenna on their hands and knees to scrub out what they graciously called special dielectric materials from pigeons who had made a nest. In the early universe, there was a huge plasma everywhere, not just in one corner, but everywhere. The photons were everywhere. And it's like sitting in a bathtub full of these photons. And they're just losing their energy as the overall size of space continues to grow. The Big Bang happened at x equals 0, and x equals 1, equals 2. Any place we could put spatial coordinates to on this model, those all experienced the Big Bang at the same time. And we're just immersed in it trying to measure it as we flow through it. stuff per volume, the actual density of matter and energy per volume. If omega is larger than 1, you have more stuff for volume. You expect it's open or hyperbolic geometry. So far so good. Then Dicke plugged this quantity into Einstein's own equations. A universe should generically become more and more different from flat over time. And that seems like this very strange or unexplained fine tuning. If the universe has been stretching for 14 billion years, what set it to be so arbitrarily close to flat is an unstable equilibrium point? like circa 1980. He was not originally asking questions about the cosmos, but he was haphazardly encountering some of those questions, again, very much like Tony Zee around the same time. What Alan was interested in was in things like spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Higgs mechanism. He realized that this kind of feature could actually lead to a cosmologically distinct kind of evolution. If you have a time even briefly during which the energy density, the amount of stuff per volume gets stuck, then the energy could remain constant. That stretch of growth in the size of space will stretch exponentially. grows very fast in time-- while the energy density remains nearly constant. Now you'd see this expression, the deviation of the universe from spatially flat. That deviation should rapidly fall to 0. The universe today should look indistinguishable from a flat universe because the difference from flatness was driven to 0 dynamically. If inflation happened, there should've been a very brief period before what had previously been called the Big Bang. It didn't keep doing that during the rest of this Big Bang, and the universe grew by 30 orders of magnitude. higher energy photons in the CMB and slightly lower energy photons. And the idea now is that the regions of the sky from which these photons were emitted are telling us about the very, very tiny unevenness in the distribution of matter and energy. They have been mapped by three generations of satellites above the ground with increasingly precise ground based measurements as well. Each of these came out 10 years apart with an increase of about a factor of 30 in the angular resolution of thesky. And so we can now make plots like this. Inflation says similar kinds of things should've been happening in the earliest moments everywhere in space through this very violent, rapid stretching of space. At the moment when the electrically neutral atoms start to form, if there were this sea or bath of gravitational waves, then the high school auditorium-- imagine where this dance is happening. These are mathematically more complicated structure. You should have this periodic squeezing, stretching, and then inverted by 90 degrees. So a version of these were found by the LIGO collaboration and announced early in 2016. March of 2014, a team using the BICEP satellite at the South Pole announced they had actually measured exactly that corkscrew pattern. It remains an open question to this day whether these primordial curling, twisting patterns really can be detected. So why is the universe lumpy? Why is this cascade of scales? Because space time is wiggly, and matter is jiggly. An alternate hypothesis for why the universe is so messy is because Alan's been generating the mess in his own office, and it's expanded to cosmic scales.

Summary:
The Peloponnesian War was fought in 431 BC. After the war, Spartan power had grown to an unprecedented degree. For the first time there were lots of Spartans, who had lots of money. The Spartans had choices that they could take. They could either stay in the Pelop onnesus, or they could contest it in their power to control the entire Greek world in the east. Or they could have some control of the Aegean and the Hellespont. Spanish Armada was heading for England trying to gain control of the island for the Pope and Catholicism and one thing and another. Great wind came up and it blew the ships out of their path and wrecked many of them. From that day forward there sprang up the legend in England of the Protestant Wind, which had come along to save the new English faith against the forces of the Pope. Well, if they can invent a Protestant Wind I think it's okay for me to speak about the democratic snow that fell on Phyle that went. forces in the state had come, and we might mention also that the ancient sources estimate that something like 1,500 Athenians may have been killed by the Thirty tyrants. When the Thirty brought an army out to try to defeat him there he defeated them. They were forced to flee to Eleusis on the northwestern frontier of Attica, and the democrats were in position to take control of the city again. The Thirty were deposed by the 3,000, because it was obvious they were losers.

Summary:
The coherent state has a simple definition, simple but subtle. It's an eigenstate of the annihilation operator, and it has a complex eigenvalue alpha. The person who popularized those states was Glauber, and he got amply rewarded for that. We are now using the coherent states to look at any other quantum state of the electromagnetic field, any statistical operator which describes photons by forming the diagram matrix element of the statistical operator with alpha. And now we realize that coherent states are not as wonderful as I believe. Vladan Vuletan: Coherent states, as I've just shown you, are very classical. They've always a g2 function of 1. And attenuation is not changing it. So a coherent state with an expectation value of 1 photon is not a single photon. But of course, there are ways how you can get single photons. And this is, well, you start with single atoms. Namely, if you have a single atom in the excited state, it can emit only one photon. So that's a way how we can create non-classical states of light.

We then go into some geometric signal Theory with Transformers and finally how how we can kind of generate sounds using these. The next thing we're going to kind oftalk about is changing forms. We'll talk about the SARS ADC algorithm and how it's used to convert digital signals to analog. is less than double of the highest frequency present aliasing will happen. This asserts that you need at least two samples per period. aliasing is the byproduct of poor sampling. A lower wave resolution will result in a modified output signal as compared to the original input that we're trying to process. There's a lot of literature about um aliasing effects including spatial illnessing. The aliasing phenomenon is incredibly interesting this happens both visually and auditorily. It's a very prevalent problem in any problem.

JACK HARE: Let's do a little recap on electron cyclotron emission. We expect to have multiple different peaks, even from a single particle. These peaks are going to be occurring at frequencies. And we can say this is m equals 1, m equals 2,. m equals 3. And they're evenly spaced. And so, we have these peaks here. But if we neglect that, the frequency depends only on the magnetic field. So, if you see some emission at some certain frequency, then you know that it's been emitted by a region of plasma which has this magnetic fields. This is correlation ECE, often called CECE. We want to measure temperature fluctuations within the plasma that are maybe on the order of 1% of the baseline temperature, delta T upon T about 0.01. And that 1% is actually extremely hard to measure. And this is because the noise is just too high on these systems. There are lots of different contributions to the noise. But, in general, they all add up to make it very hard toMeasure these very small fluctuations. want to understand in plasmas so that we can build an economically viable fusion reactor. Now, the fact that the noise is too high does seem like a big limitation. But there are some clever tricks that we play where we use correlations. And I'll talk now about what exactly these correlations are and how they provide us with information that allows us to get a signal out despite the overwhelming [INAUDIBLE]. So our setup here is borrowed from ASDEX Upgrade. And, in effect, I referred to Alex Creely's PhD thesis, which you can find online if you want more information. Many oscillations. And so, it will average out to 1 or something like that. So it's some DC offset that we can subtract off after. So all this is doing here is mixing the signal down so it gets to a regime that we could effectively digitize. Yeah, another question. STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] JACK HARE: So if we were doing geometric optics, which we're not, then you would have a lens like this. That lens could collimate your beam. And if it collimated that beam, that would mean there'd be a focus point at some distance f away. very small region on the order of 100 microns. Anyone know how micro splitters work? Looking at you? STUDENT: RF. JACK HARE: The answer I got was RF, which I don't think is much more satisfying than my answer. But, you're right, you could come up with some clever analog way of doing the splitting. But this is getting way beyond what I was hoping to talk about on this. So let's get on to correlation ECE see what that does. The technique is incredibly powerful because it's enabled people to measure, again, delta on the order of 1%. Someone called it nominative determinism, and they've done it on 1%. And it's used in a variety of applications, but this is an example of what these angle brackets are doing. There are actually lots of different ways of doing this, but there are a few different ways to do correlations, and I'm not going to go into them, but I will give you a citation at the moment. Bremsstrahlung is a term used to refer to a type of radiation in the universe. It involves electrons being deflected and breaking and emitting these photons. There are lots of different ways to deal with bremsstahlung to do the actual calculation. The main thing we can say in a classical treatment is that the bremstahlt is going to be isotropic in every direction. That's actually quite different from electron cyclotron emission, even though we didn't really look at the anisotropy of that in any detail. here with the ions and electrons as point particles. There's a semi-classical approach where you start bringing in some quantum physics and treat, I think, the electron as a wave. And then there's a full quantum approach. What's remarkable about all of these approaches is they all give the same answer with just a very slightly different coefficient. The scalings are the same. So, in some sense, although it's important to get the exact coefficient, it doesn't matter exactly which one of these techniques you use. Professor Jack HARE: We're going to switch to a slightly quantum model of the atom. We have a range of different discrete energy levels that the electrons can occupy. These energy levels are labeled by the principal quantum number n. And, up here, infinity, this is ionization. If your electron gets this much energy, it becomes free again, HARE says. But, of course, there's another case where this photon takes away so much energy that this starts, I guess it becomes imaginary. Bolometry is, in some sense, a very simple diagnostic. It cares not at all about the detailed spectrum of what the emission is. It just wants to know how much power is being radiated by the plasma. We have a little sensor sitting at the wall of our vacuum vessel. And that sensor is just a resistor. It has a resistance M, and that resistance M is a function of temperature here. And, from that temperature, we can make an estimate of the radiation power incident upon it. difference between those. neutron damage leads us to use much thicker substrates, which gives us a longer time response and so, therefore, a worse bolometer. So, ironically, the bolometers that will be used on [INAUDIBLE] are significantly worse than the bolometer used on existing devices. And I'm sure that [? Spark ?] will have exactly the same problem. Almost everyone in the world uses this design of bolometer that they pioneered on ASDEX Upgrade in the '80s. No one has come up with a better system yet.

Summary:
So, last time we were starting to talk about the sort of the general overview of what reinforcement learning involves. We introduced the notion [NOISE] of a model, a value, and a policy. Can anybody remember off the top of their head what a model was in the context of reinforcement learning? So what we're gonna do today is, sort of, um, build up for Markov Processes, up to Markov Decision Processes. And this build, I think, is sort of a nice one because it allows one to think about what happens in the cases where you might not have control over the world. There exists a unique optimal value function. The optimal policy for an MDP and an infinite horizon finite state MDP is deterministic. There are two choices for every state and there are seven states. The [NOISE] number of policies is |A| to the |S|. It's a mapping from states to actions so it's gonna be 2 to the 7th. We'll talk about- probably a little bit clearer to when we talk about contraction properties later. Um, any one want to take a guess of whether or not the optimal policy is always unique? I think there might be cases where it's not.

Professor: angular momentum is a set of operators that provide observables, things we can measure. He says they're particularly important for systems in which you have central potentials. Professor: If you have two energy for every system except for every energy except for 0, you have a problem. You know the problem, if you can uniquely characterize the states of the system, then you can learn more about the physics of this state, he says, and you can also know more about physics of a circle.

Summary:
There are three common uses of a rotation matrix. The first is to represent an orientation. The second is to change the frame of reference of a vector. And the third is to rotate a vector or frame. To demonstrate these, I will use these three coordinate frames, representing the same space with different orientations. To help you visualize these frames in 3 dimensions, I’ll use my handy tinkertoy frame. This is the z-axis, this is the x-axis and the y-axis. we will learn how to represent the angular velocity of a frame. We will also learn about how to use the frame to represent a frame's angular velocity. We'll also look at how the frame is used to represent an object's speed. We hope you will join us for the next few weeks of classes on how to work with a frame in this class. The next class will be on the physics of the frame in which we are working. The final class will take place in the next week or so.

Summary:
Coded imaging is a form of a co-design between how you capture the image and how you process the image. In the Fourier domain, convolution in the image domain is multiplication in the standard Fourier transform. If you have a sharp photo and a blurred photo, you can basically represent that as asharp photo. The concept of a position or superposition applies to all three types, shadows- or refraction- or reflection-based techniques. It's a way to recover the sharp detail afterwards in software. that's your 1010 inquiry. Instead of keeping the shutter open for the entire duration and getting a well-exposed photo, the shutter is open for only half of the time. The support for the representation of the Fourier domain of that function that you describe there is infinite, right? So you actually truncate this in order to-- RAMESH RASKAR: It's not infinite because you still have some width. But when you get to invert the process then, that's why you're still not getting the perfect images. Lenses are very carefully designed by camera makers to be the same plane where you put your aperture. When you change your f-stop and decrease it and increase it, it's all happening in the center of projection. When it's in focus, it doesn't really matter what the code is, so the photo will be half a square, so you're talking about the light, so half a light, right? And that's why you have some dust on your lens and so on, unless you have the lens on your front. digitally. RAMESH RASKAR: In 1D, the Fourier transform is flat, and almost all of them are the same. In 2D, it's more distributed instead of just all being near the center, he says. Raskar: The magic of a broadband code is that it can recover all the information. He says coded aperture is very similar to the [INAUDIBLE].. AUDIENCE: Are the bokehs kind of uppity? RASkar: It depends on your-- I mean, for your average consumer. Don't know whether this matters. But you're right. If you're looking at something that's-- we have bright lights in the scene. At a distance, take our false photo. They will all look like this. Or you could put hearts in it, or, like, like-- AUDIENCE: Right, yeah, I was thinking maybe-- RAMESH RASKAR: I mean, that's totally possibly. But even if you use a cluster, it's still a pretty big number. Ramesh Raskar: Astronomers are already using circular convolution in astronomy. He says the technique can be used to create 3D images of the universe. He explains how to create different codes for different applications. RaskAR: The chances of a random sequence doing the right thing for you is very very low, so you have to choose a similar sequence that doesn't work for you, but it can work for astronomy. The code is called RAT code, R-A-T, which is after three quarters of a quarter. Ramesh Raskar: Compressed sensing is taking a photo and compressing it. He says the idea is to take a single photo and then recover it in a compressed way. Rasksar: If you're on 2 megapixels, then you need to take 2 million [? pics] All right? So the claim this group made at Rice University was that if I wanted a million-pixel image, I don't have to really take a million readings, he says. Rasa: I can take this picture effectively with just 10,000 pixels but recreate a million pixel image. which is how to write a paper and wishlist for photography.

Prof. Clark: Middle class was a form of self-identity that was constructed in the way being a worker was constructed, or being a noble. When you see Daumier or you see Delacroix's famous, Liberty Leading the People, and you see the bourgeois, there with his top hat, he's dressed in a bourgeois uniform like this. That emerges out of the bourgeois century. The middle classes started dressing like this in the nineteenth century, dark with a little bit of color. Once we've got an increase in the wealth of the middle classes, then you wanted the political power. I was trying to explain how people on the top rung were trying to beat down people at the bottom. I ended up smashing this umbrella, sort of the imaginary of somebody smashing their guitar onstage. But the point is that the umbrellas come with the middle class. They're not these big colored things you have now. It was the idea of protecting that one suit. In all of these countries the right to vote was defined, until you have universal male suffrage, by how much taxes you paid and how much property you own.

In automotive design Dynamics plays a very important part because it's not rigid body Dynamics it's a bunch of rigid bodies with springs the Springs are called starts with an S suspens suspensions right and there's a trade-off between how comfortable the ride is and how tightly the car handles. In Dynamics there two sides to it one is here's the system what is its trajectory going to be in other words how will its various degrees of freedom behave over time if you you know stretch it and let it go and it goes twang you know boing right. class but he also solves the problem the direct way and by coincidence the problem not comes out to be the same. I might go to like a Monday off M um like later on a Monday or maybe Wednesday later or something like that. There's no class next Monday and um we posted the solution to that problem from class. I won't have officers today only because you don't want to hear me Babel I'm really sick um but I'm also going to change my officers um several people suggest so the timing isn't right. I'm referring to something with no Dimensions but with a finite Mass you know that someone asked me the other day and I just want to be sure to say this. Let's say that you have a particle Point Mass heading that way some direction and let's define its velocity we'll call it a v p okay so I have um two questions both of which you probably know the answers to the first is what is the angular momentum of that particle just from your memory go ahead say it aha. This is a really badly designed classroom in the sense that there's not enough room but it's a huge classroom so I'm going to write it big right and I'm not that neat so you're going to have to bear with me so this is a velocity of Point P minus a Velocity of Point Q cross product M velocity P. I'm just going down I'm doing something odd but not wrong because I know with where it needs to end up question yep very likely there shouldn't be another M here. There is this term and you need to know about it okay it just so happens the term vanishes in many situations but it's key that you know see for Force f is equal to D by DT of P momentum completely coer Crystal Clear when you come to angular momentum it's say artifice yeah there's this funky term which vanishes. The reason this will become important is that when you look at rigid bodies it it actually you will end up doing something so this is a silly term but these are the two conditions yeah Q is fixed. it's not Kosher can't do it if I do I need to include that term right and you you've got a figure that a simple thing like my a robot is a very typical Dynamics application okay common mistake okay now that we've done this let's try and figure out why angular momentum is useful let's solve a problem any questions about this any questions bottom line if you're taking angle momenta about moving points be careful bottom line many conditions it'll be okay we'll elucidate we'll Express we'll we'll nail this conditions in fact that's the whole point of the next two weeks. call this Theta the initial length is L one and the initial velocity is we'll call it a scalar because this is how I'm defining the problem of V1 when we actually solve it we might have to define a vector okay. As the thing's going around this person is going to pull the string down and as it kind of goes around it's going to spiral in and end up it's a new length L2 and the question is what is V2 going to be okay. would have to do one of two things I would have had to either calculate this term or calculate or make you know make my frame attach it to the truck. I've just done it in a very precise way okay so in the end there's no surprise the whole point is to show you they could be surprises but be careful any questions about this all right snap quiz in the next 3 minutes I want you to calculate for me the final velocity literally 3 minutes because I have toDo the dumbbell problem.  angular momentum is a vector out of plane in 2D you see that okay is energy conserved for this particle why not. For energy you need a little more detail of what I'm doing here right any questions can you get the angle the from the we did in fact we did right if you think about this angle the angular momentum formulation actually came precisely from FAL to ma. I told you I'm on drugs okay and there's a master missing as well there you go and the mm will cancel out okay go ahead.

Summary:
Andrej Karpathy: In this module, I'm going to briefly introduce the idea of differentiable programming. Differentiable programming is closely related to deep learning. It allows you to build up an increasingly more sophisticated model without losing track of what's going on. So let's suppose you want to do image classification. We need some way of representing images. To fix this problem, we introduce convolutional neural networks which is a refinement of fully connected neural networks. So here is an example of ConvNet in action. In NLP, words are discrete objects and neural networks speak vectors. So whenever you're doing NLP with neural nets, you first have to embed words, or more generally, tokens. There's a lot of processing that needs to happen and it's hard to kind of specify in advance. So what we're going to do is going to define an abstract function. An abstract function is something that has an interface but not an implementation. I'm going to talk about two implementations of the sequence models. One is recurrent neural networks and one is transformers. encourage you to consult the original source if you want kind of the actual, the full gory details. Another thing I haven't talked about is learning any of these models. It's going to be using some variant of stochastic gradient descent, but there's often various tricks that are needed to get it to work. But maybe the final thing I'll leave you with is the idea that all of differentiable programming is built out of modules. Even if you kind of don't understand or I didn't explain the details, I think it's really important to pay attention to the type signature of these functions.

Professor Amy Hungerford: Today it is my great privilege and pleasure to introduce Andrew Goldstone, a TF in this course. Andrew is a fourth-year student in the Ph.D. program in English, and he is writing a dissertation on the autonomy of the work of art in modernism. On Monday we had three main themes that were used to introduce this novel to you. And that's the question that I'm mostly going to focus on today. I'm going to bracket the ethical question, leave that for Monday's lecture. For Nabokov, the highest value is originality. He says this in his last Russian novel, The Gift. "Any genuinely new trend in art is a knight's move, a change of shadows, a shift that displaces the mirror," he says. "In other words, there is another form of perverted desire hiding behind the one in front of us that's hiding behind one in the back" "I want to show you that way of writing very early in the book on page 10 now," he writes. Nabokov says he had to invent America because it wasn't given to him. He lives in a kind of denaturalized world, a world where everything has to be decoded, he says. Nabokov's wife, Vera, drove him around the country while he was writing the novel. He says the evocations of the American landscape are the closest he's come to pure beauty. "I think the source of the most appealing writing in this book's so let's look at it now," he writes.

NORVIN RICHARDS: Today is phonetics, which means that today we begin making funny sounds at each other. One standard way of talking about different kinds of speech sounds is to talk about where in the vocal tract the flow of air can get obstructed. So for example, there are what are called bilabial sounds. These are sounds which are made with both lips. And so that's what you do for the sounds that are at the beginnings of words like "paint" and "bath," and "mouth," and well, "wipe" Inventor: "r" is one of the kinds of sounds that people classically have trouble with. "z" is voiced and that "s" is voiceless. "g"s and "zz" are consonant sounds that agree with the consonant that's at the end of "cat" and "dog" The difference between "cats" and 'dogs' is voiced or voiceless, the phonologist says. "R" might be an example, but we'll get to "r," eventually. The way nasal stops work is you're stopping the flow of air somewhere in your vocal tract, but you're allowing the air to flow through your nasal cavity. You can have an alveolar nasal, right? "n," or a velar nasal, "ng" What would a glottal nasal sound like? Trick question. You would need surgery. So you would need, again, as I say, probably there are unethical surgeons who would modify you so that you could makeglottal nasals. English has interdental fricatives and alveolar stops, "t" and "d" There are languages out there that have what are called dental stops. Part of your job, if you're learning Tagalog, for example, is to learn to make dental 't's instead of alveolars. There's all this work on what people do to compensate for various kinds of obstructions in the vocal tract. And on the website, there will be a link to charts that will have more official charts by the IPA. Student: "Sue says he's a bad egg."

Summary:
then we are going to continue with the second part of the lecture today which focuses on the problem what actually happens if the gaussian assumption that i have about my constraints doesn't hold. As you will see in some small examples having this outliers in your optimization problem is something which hurts dramatically which actually screw up your solution. Already a few outliers can lead to a environment model which is completely unusable for doing any navigation task so where the geometry of what you computed doesn't fit to the real world geometry anymore and one of the questions actually how to handle that. just replace this information matrix here with a variant which has a scaling factor so a constraint dependent scaling factor added to that. This leads to the case that constraints which are far away from what we expect have a smaller influence on the optimization so we can actually visualize this. The further you move out the more the red curve gets scaled so it gets kind of fatter and fatter  and better. The problem that we have in this gaussian distribution and this holds for  the point is actually away there's one technique which you can find which is also quite easy to implement. Max mixture as well as for dcs is that kind of the tails of this gaussian distributions contain too few probability mass they're too close to zero. If you have constraint which introduce large errors these are these outliers this can actually screw up the optimization. If we have one outlier which is really far away from the current estimate the whole mole is tracked in this direction that's the problem that we have with a gaussian distribution. The max mixture approach is actually kind of similar to this corrupted gaussian so if you plot both of them together.

John Stuart Mill is the principle expositor of neoclassical utilitarianism. The rights-utility synthesis signals that we're looking for an attempt to put together both a commitment to utilitarian efficiency that's grounded in science on the one hand, and respect for individual rights that's grounding in the workmanship ideal on the other hand. At the same time, more or less, there were very important developments in moral philosophy that I just want to alert you to. The doctrine that I'm mentioning here is the doctrine that would come to be called emotivism. Prof: These indifference curves cannot cross. Can anybody tell us why? Why can't they cross? Wait for the mic. Student: Because at the intersection they should have the same utility. Prof: So you've got a kind of contradiction on your hands, is that right? Student: Yeah. Professor: Okay, and just to spell out the contradiction more emphatically--I think you basically made the point. So we have a distribution here, okay? Now what Pareto said, he said, "Let's draw a line north-south through the status quo"

He says this tells you that at least two components already can transform. we have-- so this real scalar theory-- we can see that before. So this theory has a discrete symmetry because this is invariant under phi. It goes to minus phi, OK? So this is-- if you do it twice, you go back to itself. OK, so this is called the Z2 symmetry. And there are also spacetime discrete symmetries. So you can have so-called time reversal, which corresponding to your t, x goes to plus t. And so, altogether, they are called CPT symmetry. Yeah.

Summary:
The best-case scenario for expansionary fiscal policy is when there are lots of underemployed resources in the economy. By increasing spending, the federal government can try to counteract falling aggregate demand. In one scenario, government spending doesn't have to be as large as the fall in "C," or consumption, to counteract the recession, and that's because of the multiplier effect. But, as always, shifting lines on a graph is much easier than shifting around real resources in a multi-trillion dollar economy.

Sarah thread sterner shows you how to wear and take off a mask. She explains how to determine which part of the mask is the front versus the back. She also shows how to mold the nose piece of the face mask with the finger tips of both hands. Finally, she shows you the best way to remove the mask by placing it over your ears and pulling it under your chin when removing the mask it's important to remember that the front is considered contaminated so remove it with the fingertip and then perform hand hygiene.

Summary:
In this lecture, we're going to talk about how neurons function and how researchers are able to control that function in order to modify behavior. Then we'll talk about synapses and how synapses function to communicate between neurons. And this is going to involve also sort of understanding how certain antidepressants, like Prozac, work. And then we'll end by talking about how researchers did this experiment to wake up the mouse. And it all starts with something that I told you about at the beginning of the semester, which is the plasma membrane. In a resting state, the cell's resting potential is negative 70 millivolts. The cell can lose this polarity and not have a charge differential, or it can flip and be positive on the inside. Stephen suggested opening ion channels. If you open these, it's going to depolarize the cell. Because remember, high on the outside, out here. And so if you open them, positive ions are going to flow in to make this less positive. So what is an action potential? Everyone see how it's a transient potential. you to test the function of the neuron in the behavior of an organism. So, in this case, this mouse, the light is shined into its brain, and they're testing a specific type of neuron that is involved in arousal of the mouse. And it's going to wake up right now. There it goes. It woke up. You see now its muscle activity is going, OK? So you can test thefunction of specific nerve cells using this approach, and it's because you have a light-sensitive sodium channel.

Summary:
In this problem, we're going to be dealing with a variation of the usual coin-flipping problem. But in this case, the bias itself of the coin is going toBe random. And we're told that the expectation of this bias is some mu and that the variance of the bias isSome sigma squared. And what we'll be asked is find a bunch of different expectations, covariances, and variances. We'll see that this problem gives us some good exercise in a few concepts, a lot of iterated expectations.
