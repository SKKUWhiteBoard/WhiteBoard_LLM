Political philosophy is the oldest of the social sciences. It can boast a wealth of heavy hitters from Plato and Aristotle to Machiavelli, Hobbes, Hegel, Tocqueville, Nietzsche. The study of the great books or great thinkers of the past can easily degenerate into a kind of antiquarianism, into a sort of pedantry, says Professor Steven Smith. But these works provide us with the most basic questions that continue to guide our field, he says. "The ideas of John Maynard Keynes, both economists and political philosophers, when they are right, are more powerful than is commonly understood," says Smith.
