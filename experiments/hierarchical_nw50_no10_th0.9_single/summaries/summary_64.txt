We reported in 2008 that DB plan investments in hedge funds and private equity have grown, but such investments are generally a small portion of plan assets. The average allocation to hedge funds among plans with such investments was a little over 5 percent in 2010. Of the 78 large plans that reported hedge fund investments in 2010, 20 had allocations of 10 percent or more. While any investment may fail to deliver expected returns over time, some hedge fund returns over some time may be higher than those expected for private equity.
