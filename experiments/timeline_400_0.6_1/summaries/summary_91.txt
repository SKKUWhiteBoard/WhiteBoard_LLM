Aristotle was born 384,15 years after the trial of Socrates. He was sent by his father to go to college. Unlike most of you, Aristotle did not spend four years at the Platonic Academy. He remained attached to it for the next 20, until the death of Plato. Unlike his intellectual godfather, Socrates, who wrote nothing but conversed endlessly, Aristotle wrote disciplined and thematic treatises on virtually every topic. He collected constitutions, 158 of them in all, from throughout the ancient world. the preserve of the few, of a minority capable of sharing in the administration of justice and in the offices of a city. It seems to be a very elite teaching. Would you agree? Unappealing to us, perhaps, for that reason, very contrary to our intuitions and the way we have been brought up. But before we dismiss Aristotle's account as insufferably inegalitarian and elitist, we have to ask a difficult question. What else is Yale, but an elite institution intended to educate, morally and intellectually, potential members of a leadership class?
