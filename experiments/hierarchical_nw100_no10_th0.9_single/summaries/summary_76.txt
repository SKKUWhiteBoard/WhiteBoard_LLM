The Volcker Rule is designed to prohibit banks from engaging in risky, short-term, speculative trading and investing in private equity and hedge funds. These are practices long condemned by the Rule's namesake, former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker. The Federal Reserve Board set the date when conformance with the Rule is required as July 21, 2015, although that date could be extended an additional two years. The report concludes by addressing other aspects of the Rule that apply generally to banking entities.
