So let me say here just the repetition, normal, inferior. Let us say we are talking about price of good 1 has gone up substitution, income these are the effects and overall. When P 1 goes up subs because of substitution effect x 1 will. Come down. And for income also because of income effect it will come down. So, overall it comes down. While inferior goods substitution effect quantity demanded would come down while income effect is Up. Up. Can you give me an example its very very difficult to find Giffen good in real life why? Sir, like if Gucci is a brand and it is. Prices comes down by significant amount. No one could buy a Gucci, it is at that level. only because of it is prices. I am not certain about this statement then when price of these goods would come down then people would not buy what you are saying. No, no if some purse is very expensive like 10 lakh rupees and it symbolizes your status. And other day it comes down to 1 lakh rupee. Then there is no point that the set of people who were consuming that purse that good for 10 lakhRupees to show their status would buy the same purse at 1 lakh Rupees because it will become more common. During Irish famine the potato was Giffen good because people were using most of their income to buy potato because that is what they would consume. So, when the price of potato went up they could not even spare little bit of money for meat and other food products. To get enough calorie; they had to increase the consumption of potato. But the problem is with this the second requirement that income effect is larger than the substitution effect. Typically this is not fulfilled that is why we have very-very hard time getting finding out, figuring out Giffsen good in an economy.
