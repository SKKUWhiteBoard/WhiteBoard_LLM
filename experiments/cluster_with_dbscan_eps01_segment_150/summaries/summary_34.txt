was expansionary. That was contractionary. But it was overwhelmed or offset, more than offset by the improvement in the outlook that you had. And that also happens with monetary policy. Countries that have high inflation problems and so on sometimes get-- and they have to go through dramatic tightenings. Yes, most of them get very short-lived recession. But sometimes they are veryshort-lived recessions because eventually the reduction of the instability caused by high and unstable inflation sort of ends up dominating any direct contractionary effect. Expectations play a big role in the decision of all economic actors. Milton Friedman called it the permanent income theory of consumption. You don't want to be moving consumption up and down like crazy. Once you realize, more or less, what you'll get on average, then you should-- consumption should be related to that concept. We will develop a life-cycle theory of Consumption, which says, look, even at the level of an individual, the day-to-day income is not really what determines consumption.
