Instructor: We are asked to identify the areas of consumer surplus, producer surplus, tax revenue, and deadweight loss in this market after the tax. So pause this video, have a go at it. Even if you struggle with it it will make your brain more attuned to when we work through it together. All right, now let's work through this together. And I just want to sort of understand what's going on here before I even try to answer their questions. So first, let's think about the consumer surplus. The consumer surplus is going to be the region above our new horizontal price. And below the demand curve. unit quantity. And so this area is the government, is the revenue to the government. So, S plus U is equal to tax revenue. Tax revenue. And then last but not least, what about the deadweight loss? Well remember, the dead weight loss is the difference between the original the total surplus. When we just let things naturally go to equilibrium. The difference between that and now our new total surplus, which is now lower because we have not allowed the market to function in a very natural way because of this tax on it.
