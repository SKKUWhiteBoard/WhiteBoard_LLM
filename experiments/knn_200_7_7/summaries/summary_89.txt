Rafael JARAMILLO: Today we're going to discuss the many D's of thermodynamics. He says lowercase d, lowercase Greek d, and uppercase Greek D are the most physical, unstated assumptions. Jaramillo: To illustrate the concept of transformation quantities, it helps to draw state function surfaces. The most common transformations that we talk about are transformations that take place at constant pressure and constant temperature, he says. The transformation entropy between phase alpha and beta at a given pressure and temperature. of two independent variables. So, for example, we could have the entropy of phase alpha drawn as a function of temperature and pressure. So this is a 3D visualization of how the entropy for a given phase might vary with pressure and temperature at a fixed composition. So to illustrate transformation quantities, I want to draw the transformation entropy for an isobaric, isothermal phase transformation. We're going to be two different state function services, one for each phase. We'll label this beta. And I'll draw another state function service for phase alpha.
