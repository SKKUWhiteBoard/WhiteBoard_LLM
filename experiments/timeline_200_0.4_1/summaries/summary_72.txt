The Peloponnesian War was fought in 431 BC. After the war, Spartan power had grown to an unprecedented degree. For the first time there were lots of Spartans, who had lots of money. The Spartans had choices that they could take. They could either stay in the Pelop onnesus, or they could contest it in their power to control the entire Greek world in the east. Or they could have some control of the Aegean and the Hellespont. Thrasybulus, the leader of the Thirty, was deposed by a group of 3,000. He appealed to Sparta for help against this democratic army that he had put out. The Spartans did vote to send an army in there to deal with Thrasy Bulus, but they did not put Lysander at the head of the army. Instead King Pausaniasas was sent out to do the job, they met under ThrasyBulus and defeated him. For one thing, as they had in the past, the Athenians fought bravely and well and inflicted serious losses on the army, but it was also obvious that Pausanas was willing to negotiate.
