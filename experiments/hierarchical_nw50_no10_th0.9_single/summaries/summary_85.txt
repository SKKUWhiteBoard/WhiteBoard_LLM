USDAâ€™s CBAs provide services such as farm loans and conservation assistance. Under the E- File Act, these agencies were required to establish an electronic filing and retrieval system. The law further mandated that by June 20, 2002, agricultural producers be able to file paperwork electronically with USDA if they choose to do so. By the December 18 deadline, the CBAs had successfully established a common Internet Web site, obtained OMB approval for 52 FSA and NRCS forms, and placed them on the Internet. However, none of the 100-plus forms that theCBAs expected to have deployed on the site by the deadline were available.
