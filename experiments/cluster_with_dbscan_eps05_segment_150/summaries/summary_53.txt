Markus Klute: In this chapter, we look at tests and implications of special relativity. One experimental test is stellar aberration, which we discussed can be explained by special relativity and by velocity addition. Light isotropy is being tested in a variety of different experiments, including Michelson-Morley and Kennedy and Thorndike. We will have a discussion of implications ofspecial relativity as we move on from here, Klute says. The final chapter of the special relativity course will be presented in the spring of 2015. and optics, upon the principle of relative movement." We now know this was wrong, but scientific process happens in scientific environment. And I started this class by explaining that one needs to be open minded to learn and to study and to grow scientifically. And one has to question the assumptions, understand the assumptions when then go into measurements. So this is the first part of this chapter where we talk about tests. We will have a discussion of implications of special relativity as we move on from here. One of the hypotheses you could have is that the photon actually is a massive particle. This would directly modify Coulomb's laws, which are tested experimentally. Another class of experiment is where we look directly at time dilation, for example, in the decay of the muon. There is weird electromagnetic effect if you introduce a mass to the photons like torque on a magnetic ring. Again, here precision measurements have been performed. And they're all in agreement with the hypothesis that the photons are massless.
