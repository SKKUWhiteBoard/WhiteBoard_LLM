The DATA Act requires government- wide reporting on a greater variety of federal funds. The act also calls for the federal government to set government-wide data standards. OMB and Treasury have made progress implementing 5 of our recommendations related to DATA Act implementation. Additional effort is needed to address 11 previous GAO recommendations relating to the DATA Act and their implementation status. The Data Standards Committee held its inaugural meeting on September 15, 2016, and will meet on a monthly basis. The committee has also drafted a charter that will delineate the scope of the work, as well as the composition and responsibilities of its members.
