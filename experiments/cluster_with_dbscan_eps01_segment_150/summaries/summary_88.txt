DNA microarray experiments and how you can use it to profile disease states and cells versus healthy cells. And then at the beginning of the next class, I'll describe how you get information out of DNA microarrays. But at the end of the day, you're always using the fluorophores as the probes for where certain things are, OK. Fluorescence is a magnificent tool. We can use fluorophore on their own, or we can use them as attached to antibodies. Fluorescence is the emission of light in the absence of heat. Luminescence is the general term. Fluorescence is a little bit more specific. There are different types of luminescence. And you'll get to see some of those varieties of luminecence. The first thing to learn about fluorescence is how to spell it. It is actually fluor-L-L. It's a biological reaction that causes luminescent. And this is a cuttlefish shown here in this image in the corner where they are brightly lit at night.
