The Obama Administration has been critical of the apparently flawed Russian presidential election which took place on March 4, 2012. Congress may consider the implications of another Putin presidency, lagging democratization, and human rights abuses in Russia as it debates possible future foreign assistance and trade legislation. Some in Congress also have criticized the conduct of the election, but have endorsed continued engagement, while others have called for stepping back and reevaluating the Administration's engagement policy. The resentment was mostly low-key at first, but signs included polls showing growing dissatisfaction with Putin and Medvedev.
