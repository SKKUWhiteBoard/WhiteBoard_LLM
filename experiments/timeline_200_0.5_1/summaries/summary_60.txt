In this chapter we will discuss two applications, one price control and second taxation, so right. Sir, does this slope of this graph denote anything price demand upon, some price upon some quantity? So, wait little later we will talk about that that topic, right now we are just talking about movement and shifts, the direction of movement. We are not talking about the slope. So, what is price control what do we mean by price control? Price control is how we can regulate the prices of the goods in the market. Many people in this country would like to have gas connection, but the suppliers cannot afford to give those many gas connections at the government-determined price. So, what they say you go to, you go for gas connection if it is your turn if somehow you are getting gas connection. What the seller would say that you want gas connection you will also have to buy gas burner from me then well you will get the gas connection ok. You are not interested in buying gas burner at really at the price which is much higher than the price that you will you have to pay in the market for a gas burner. When we have a price floor, we get excess supply then you have non-market rationing mechanism. Like the payment is not done at the time of buy, it is done after year or after few months. And one more thing we have to pay a minimum wage to the laborers. So, all these things happen whenever we have price control. But I am not saying that price control does not have advantage that when we talk about the welfare economics towards the end we will talk about it. But what I am saying definitely that there are definitely better ways to cater to the welfare of public.
