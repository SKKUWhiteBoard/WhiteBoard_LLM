Hollywood Legend Will Smith owns a team in the new E1 racing series that aims to prove the potential of electric power in the Marine industry. The nine teams have the same boat but they're working out how to push the tech and try to get ahead of the competition. The boats can reach 50 knots that's around 93 km per hour so how do they reach those speeds? The key bit here is getting up on the thin bits of the foil and staying above the water to have the speed that's right. as we go there's no set plan and it completely depends on where we are during the race and yeah it can change in a matter of minutes [Music] at the end of the day you know the teams really have to work together both Pilots have to be consistent you know One Pilot can be really fast if the other one is slower then it may come down to the wire. Having two very consistent Pilots that can work together is how you're really going to win let's po that champagne [Applause] hope it continues for many years to come. We are proud to be a part of the history of the city. We hope to see it continue for many more years. Thank you for all your support and good wishes. We will continue to support the city in any way we can over the next few years. Back to Mail Online home.Back to the page you came from.
