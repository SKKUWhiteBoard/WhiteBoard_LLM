In particle physics and in nuclear physics, we use a system called natural units. This system is based on fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics and special relativity. In this class, we'll use natural units in some examples, and SI units in others. This will use Heaviside-Lorentz units and combine them with some measurable units we discussed in the previous class. We'll end the discussion in 8.701 on units, and come back in the next class to talk about the theory of relativity. always be clear from the problem we're looking at.
