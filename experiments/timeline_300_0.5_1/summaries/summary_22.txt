Robotics is a really cool and important direction for the future. I really believe that in the future we will have AI assistance whether they are embodied or not to act as our guardian angels. These agents will help us with cognitive and physical work. With AI we will see such a wide breadth of applications for instance these technologies have the potential to reduce and eliminate car accidents. We have three types of learning and you have seen different aspects of these methodologies throughout the course we have supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. There is so much opportunity for developing improved machine learning using existing models and inventing new models. If we can do this we can create an exciting work world where machines will really Empower us will really augment us and enhance us in our cognitive abilities and in our physical abilities. Just imagine waking up enabled by your personal assistant that figures out the optimal time and helps you organize all the items that you need for the day and then brings them to you. Just-in-time Holograms could be used to make the virtual world much more much more realistic much more connected. the kind of future that machine learning artificial intelligence and robots are enabling. I'm personally very excited about this future with robots helping us with cognitive and physical work. This future is really dependent on very important new advancements that will come from all of you and so I'm so excited to see what you'll be doing in the next years in the years ahead so thank you very much and uh come come work with us.
