Ahern: I have never had an exam where I had fewer questions. There were maybe 10 questions I got on the exam and that was for a class of this side. I find most students are honest. I've only had a handful of situations where in this class, where I've had dishonesty as an issue. The only students I've ever had with serious dishonesty issues actually were in smaller classes interestingly enough. But it has happened here and I do have taped evidence when it does happen. So that's why I do it. One of these is an enzyme we've been talking about some already, that's the carbonic anhydrase. Carbonic anHydrase can catalyze the conversion of a million molecules of substrate into product per second, per enzyme. The basic mechanisms are the same. We created a nucleophile, the nucleophile attacks the carbonyl group, the peptide bond breaks, and the pieces go their way. This business of creating nucleophiles is not unique to proteases. There are other enzymes that use nucleophile and generation of nucleophile in their catalytic mechanisms. Most enzymes have a fairly narrow pH range where they work that's ideal. Most of our body tissues are at a pH of 7 to 7.4. At pH 9, this enzyme is far more active than it is at pH 7, indicating that a very, very important step is the removal of that proton. The faster the nucleophile can form, the faster the enzyme is going to be. If the enzyme structure is stable at pH 10, the enzyme will be better at 10 than at 7. Because it's easier to make that nucleophile at 10.
