area of my scanner and say okay say if the robot was sitting standing over here that's the area it may have observed then I can simply check is the current sensor range is there an overlap between the current sends a range and the possible observation that I obtained from b1 on b2 and if I found places for which this holds then this is the case for b1. In contrast is that if I look to be - I can say okay the uncertainty of b2 extended with the visibility range of my of my sensor by no means overlaps with a so it's extremely unlikely that a can match b2. Based on the position of my stereo camera I try to build a local model of the surrounding so what we want to estimate is the X Y that and three angles your roll pitch and yaw so if you have this your camera looking forward this is roll this is pitch and this is your and so as I said before by adding this IMU to the to the stereo camera and the in this case the the camera is looking downward to me of the IMU on top we know the gravity vector and so this eliminates the roll directionally. Ambiguity or not it's kind of if the uncertainty lips of speakers need to seen all that area to make this is no that's the only place where I actually can match and about the special clustering technique for the original paper where you find all the information here's the work back in also recognizing places using spectral clustered local matches. This is exactly the approach that I presented here and actually a couple of the slides that I use in here or of the images material at least comes from a tin Olsen. okay so welcome to the last lecture of this course here in this winter term and what we discussed so far in the course were mainly the so-called backends or optimization engines or probablistic estimation techniques. Today I would like to give a very very of course brief short overview about front ends and one important aspect inside successful front ends on how to determine if a constraint is likely to be a correct one so we are still interested in avoiding to add roam constraints although we've learned that we there are techniques which can deal with outliers in the data Association.
