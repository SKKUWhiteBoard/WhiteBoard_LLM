Albert Meyer: Random variables are an absolutely fundamental concept in probability theory. He says in a game called the bigger number game, two teams try to pick the larger number. Meyerer: You can only win with probability 50/50, and that's true no matter what Z you take. "You pick Z in a way that can't be predicted or made use of by Team 1," he says. "When you see a small number, you'll stick. But what's going to be large and small is going to vary depending on what you play" naive thing to do would be to choose Z to be in the middle of the interval from 0 to 7. If you're Z was 3, they would always choose their numbers to be, say, 0 and 1. And that way, when you were switching, your Z would tell you that you had a small number, you should switch to the other one. And you'd only have a 50/50 chance of winning. So if you fixed that value of Z, Team 2 has a way of ensuring that you have no advantage. The most interesting case is the middle case. That is, when your Z, which was chosen at random, happens to fall in the interval between low and high. And then in that case, your Z is really guiding you correctly on what to do. If you turn over the low card, then it's going to look low because it's less than or equal to Z so you'll switch to the high card and win. But if you turn the high cards over, it'll be greater than Z so it'll look high and you'll know to stick with it.
