Bolek Wyslouch: How do you convert a given physical system with all the forces, et cetera, into some sort of fixed form, fixed type of notation? Bolek: We will work on two, again, simple physical systems, one that consists of two pendula driven by forces of gravity, each of them. And we will discuss various interesting-- even though the system is very simple, just two masses, a spring, a little bit of gravity on top of that. BolesLAW WYSLOUCH: You can have all kinds of motions by simply adjusting initial conditions. So do you know-- so this is how we can have different shape of motion, depending on the initial condition. So let's say, in fact, do I have it in this one here? Yes. So now, let's take it to, for example, Jupiter. Jupiter, g, is much larger. So the frequency would be larger. Things will be faster, right? That's the higher frequency. But also the difference between two frequencies will be smaller. sort of early on, to instead of, so far, when we talked about pendula, we describe their motion in terms of motion of number 1. It turns out we can rewrite the equation into some sort of new variables, where, so-called normal coordinates, where you'll simultaneously describe both of them and then kind of mix them together to have a new formula. So you do change of variables. So instead of keeping track of x1 and x2 independently, you define something which I called u1, which is simply x1 plus x2, and I define u2,which is x1 minus x2.
