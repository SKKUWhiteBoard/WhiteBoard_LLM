Jonathan Gruber: What stops people from bingeing on everything? It's their budget constraint. Gruber says the median American household has $400 in the bank. He says you can essentially devote your income to some combination of pizza and cookies. But you have to consider how much they actually cost in doing that, he says. Grubert: If you wanted just pizza, you could get six pizzas. But if you wanted 12 cookies, you can only get 12 of them at a time.
