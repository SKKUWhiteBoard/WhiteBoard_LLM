The "Victoria" made the first circumnavigation of the globe in 1522. But this story really begins in 1494, two years after Columbus's voyage on behalf of Spain. At the time, these nations had their eyes on the same prize: trade routes to the Spice Islands. The spices found there were used as seasonings, food preservatives, and aphrodisiacs, and were worth many times their weight in gold in 1520s and '30s. After 98 days at sea, dozens of sailors had succumbed to scurvy and famine. Magellan pressed forward, and on October 21, he started exploring a navigable sea way. 27 freezing days later, the three remaining ships emerged from what we now call the Strait of Magellan into the Mar Pacifico. Overconfident and severely outnumbered, Magellan's force was overwhelmed, and the native's bamboo spears ended the captain's life. When they finally reached land again, Enrique, the young slave, proved able to communicate with the natives. actually circumnavigate the globe. Magellan's legacy lingers. He had galaxies and space programs named after him. The "Victoria" continued west, piloted by Juan Sebasti√°n Elcano, one of the pardoned mutineers. The small vessel made it back to Spain with a full cargo of cloves and cinnamon, enough to cover the expedition and turn a profit. An obsessive chronicler, Pigafetta described the lands and people they encountered. With the help of a humble slave, he also compiled the first phrase book of native languages.
