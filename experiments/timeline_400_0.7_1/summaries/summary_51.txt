A random variable can take different numerical values depending on the outcome of the experiment. Some of the possible numerical values of a random variable will be more likely than others. We will describe these relative likelihoods in terms of the so-called probability mass function, or PMF. The PMF is also sometimes called the probability law or the probability distribution of a discrete random variable. It is a set consisting of two elements. It's a subset of the sample space. And it has a probability. And that probability we will be denoting with this notation. In order to do any probability calculations, we also need the probability law. Let us assume that every possible outcome, there's 16 of them, has the same probability which is therefore 1 over 16 for each one of the outcomes. What we want to do now is to calculate the PMF of this random variable. We need to find this value for all choices of z, that is for all possible values in the range of our random variable and add the probabilities of those values. For example, if X and Y both happen to be 1, then Z will take the value of 2. And similarly if we have this outcome, in those outcomes here, the random variable takes thevalue of 4.
