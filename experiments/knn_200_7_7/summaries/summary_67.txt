elizabeth the first is considered one of the greatest rulers in england's history if not the greatest for women. She never married can you blame her i mean look at what she grew up with around her dad and all of those moms and stepmoms she never had any kids which that causes a problem come her end time. She eventually does set on a cousin up in scotland which is the country on the same island of england but right above it uh james king james ofscotland she names him as the heir. and his son and and we'll talk more about that when we get to uh the next unit and so on the king james bible page 414 415. The bible was the bible commissioned in english for the english speakers and english readers this was the first time. Without that if you didn't know how to read latin or french you were stuck by solely getting your material this is what the bible says solely from your clergy solely from the church. Now that something is in english and if you can read english you are able to read it over and over get your own theories.
