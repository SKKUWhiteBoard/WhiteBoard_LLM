H.R. 157 / S. 160 provided for a permanent increase in the size of the U.S. House of Representatives, from 435 seats to 437 seats. Both versions treated the District of Columbia as if it were a state for the purposes of the allocation of House seats. When Alaska and Hawaii were admitted in 1959 and 1960 the House size was temporarily increased to 4 37. By retaining seats, a House size of 468 would have resulted in no state losing seats held from the 112 th to the 116 th Congresses.
