RAFAEL JARAMILLO: Let's talk about intermediate phases and line compounds. He recalls intermediate phase in a three-phase system. He draws a free-energy composition diagram in such a case. Jaramillo: All possible common tangents are going to converge at the same point. He says this type of structure is a Laves compound, which is also known as Laves Laves, or Laves' compound. It's a broad structure, he says, and it can be used to develop new materials. RAFAEL JARAMILLO: I want to introduce this and get this in your minds. Let's imagine reacting metal M with 1 mole of oxygen to form an oxide. So zM plus O2 gas reacting to form MzO2. What's z? How do I determine z? Anybody? Does anyone know some oxides? Name for me a common oxide that you know. And these oxides are line compounds. That z is not a variable. We're going to use this property of being line compounds in Wednesday's lecture.
