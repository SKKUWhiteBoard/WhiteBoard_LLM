is really great for research. If you're interested in production deployment, you should probably look at Caffe, Caffe 2 or TensorFlow. PyTorch is a great choice. But it's a bit newer, has less community support, less code out there, so it could be a bit of an adventure. So it's kind of unfortunately, there's not just like one global best framework, it kind of depends on what you're actually trying to do, what applications you anticipate. - Hello? Okay, it's after 12, so I want to get started. So today, lecture eight, we're going to talk about deep learning software. This is a super exciting topic because it changes a lot every year. But also means it's a lot of work to give this lecture. But as usual, a couple administrative notes before we dive into the material. So as a reminder the project proposals for your course projects were due on Tuesday. And again, when working on assignment two, remember to stop your Google Cloud instances.
