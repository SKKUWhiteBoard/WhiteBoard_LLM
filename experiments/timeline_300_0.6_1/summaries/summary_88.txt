Professor Amy Hungerford: Today it is my great privilege and pleasure to introduce Andrew Goldstone, a TF in this course. Andrew is a fourth-year student in the Ph.D. program in English, and he is writing a dissertation on the autonomy of the work of art in modernism. On Monday we had three main themes that were used to introduce this novel to you. And that's the question that I'm mostly going to focus on today. I'm going to bracket the ethical question, leave that for Monday's lecture. For Nabokov, the highest value is originality. He says this in his last Russian novel, The Gift. "Any genuinely new trend in art is a knight's move, a change of shadows, a shift that displaces the mirror," he says. "In chess the knight doesn't move in a straight line. Unlike any other piece, it skips over pieces in the way" The strategy of the knight'smove is to frustrate your expectations, to leap over the apparently important events into something else. The danger for Nabokov is that he will fall too in love with something too like himself. He has to hold off this possibility of being too attracted to these male predecessors who are too similar to him. To think about the word "queer," the treatment of Gaston Godin, that funny French character in Beardsley, to think about Humbert's constant protestations that he's attractive to all women, about his supposed virility. And it should just make you wonder whether pedophilia is in itself a kind of knight's move from homosexuality. Nabokov's relationship to this modernist past is not just the burlesque that he visits on Eliot. An element of admiration is also present, and that's really part of his relationship to Joyce. I'm just going to name for you four features of Joyce's style that are important to Nabokov: stylistic virtuosity, the ability to imitate any style; at the same time, a scrupulous attention to the banality of everyday life and all its detail. Third characteristic, the constant use of a superimposed structure. MaryBuck, Danielâ€¦ [and so on; I'll come back to this list, actually; just skip to the bottom on page 52] Talbot, EdgarTalbot, EdwinWayne, Lull,--[a lull in the book, right?] Williams, Ralph Windmuller, Louise. So strange and sweet was it to discover this Haze Dolores: she, in its special bower of names with its bodyguard of roses, a fairy princess between her two maids of honor. Nabokov's Lolita is a kind of artificial, processed, bland, easily consumable version of fate. In other words, chance is already fated. The thing that stands for randomness in this book, the thing that looks like ordinary detail, has already been arranged to give you artistic pleasure. This kind of transformation of arbitrary, real fated events into conspicuously artificial tricks is a response to exile, in particular to Nabokov’s condition of exile. foreign country, lives in a kind of denaturalized world, a world where, instead of everything making instant sense everything has to be decoded. In that afterword to this book, Nabokov says he had to invent America. That's because he didn't know it already; it wasn't given to him. Now, in a way this is a terrible state, a state of discontinuity with the world you exist in. But it has a payoff, kind of, a payoff which is the possibility precisely of inventing. This connection, to remember that the knight's move as a way of avoiding obstacles, in particular, keeps skipping over forms of violence. Nabokov will say that his private tragedy is that, let's see: I had to abandon my natural idiom, my untrammeled, rich, and infinitely docile Russian tongue for a second-rate brand of English devoid of any of those apparatuses. And you might think about that homophobic attitude to a Proustian past. the fear that it's too like what he wants to do. But the main point here to think about is that feeling of damage. On page 152--oh, and by the way, this book was written on road trips. Nabokov's wife, Vera, drove him on thousands of miles of trips around the country while he was writing this novel and hunting butterflies, so think about that--but here is 152, evocation of the landscape. By a paradox of pictorial thought, the average lowland North American countryside had at first seemed to me something I accepted. American landscape is already a work of art, already part of a European memory. "But gradually the models of those elementary rusticities became stranger and stranger to the eye," Humbert says. "Inutile loveliness" is kind of the key word of Nabokov's technique, and he says the novel has as its only purpose to provide aesthetic bliss. But, I don't want you to think that this just means everything's okay. Of course, everything is not okay. in a much more ambivalent position, someone who's trying to become an American writer, as Nabokov says he's doing. Humbert is trying to invent America, trying to bridge the gap between Russian and English, but always finding that English is only a kind of second best. So, that suggests that it's not all to the good; it hasn't been saved by taking up these knight's move techniques, the defamiliarizing techniques; there's still a record of damage.
