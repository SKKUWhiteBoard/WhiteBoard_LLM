Early astrologists did not recognize the lymphatics so they thought there are only three system there is a branch of portal or this branch of puerto bean. Originally doctors thought that every corner these three things are present and they call it portal triad. But later on of course the new it is not portal Triad it is portalTriad and we call it plural area. Blood is moving from the periphery to the center into these hepatic classic lobules and of course you should not forget to mention that what is this moving from center to the periphery. you understanding me right these bile ducts from every corner and this is left hepatic duct and what is this right hepatics duct and they will come common hepaticduct. I will drain the I will draw the whole structure here so once forever it must be clear hopefully is a side diagram but it has it is a very important anatomical implication. What is this here yes what is the structure thank Ria's great now what really happens. Thank You attic juices is that clear let's have a break here.
