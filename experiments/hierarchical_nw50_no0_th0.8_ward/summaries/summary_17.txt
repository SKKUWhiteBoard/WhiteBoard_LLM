the 2010 census, and the House size remained at 435, Minnesota would lose a seat relative to what it is scheduled to get as a result of the 2010 Census. Minnesota's delegation would fall to seven Representatives if the District of Columbia were to given a vote and the receive one Representative. North Carolina would be entitled to fourteen Representatives, one more than the state was scheduled to receive in the apportionment following the 2010 census. Minnesota would retain its eighth seat and no other state would be affected by the change. Table 1 shows the actual seats to be allocated based on the results of the 2010 Census. In addition, Table 1 also shows the impact on the distribution of seats in the House if the District of Columbia were to be treated as if it four seats. The law only provides for 435 seats, but the table illustrates not only the last seats assigned by the apportionment formula (ending) But the table also illustrates the end of the priority list that was used to allocate Representatives based on 2010 Census, including the D.C. impact is to examine the allocation of the last seats assigned to the states when the District of Columbia is allocated a seat (presumably the 51 st seat) The actual apportionment is done through a "priority list" calculated using the equal proportions formula provided in 2 U.S.C. ยง2a.(a) Table 2 is a list of the seats allocated to each of the states based on a formula provided by the United States Congress for apportioning seats in the House of Representatives. at 435), but the states that would just miss getting additional representation. Table 3 is similar to Table 2 , in that it displays the end of the priority list, but the last seat is 437 instead of 435. The priority values and the population needed to gain or lose are shown in Table 3. The prioritized states are those with the highest percentage of residents living in the U.S. and the lowest percentage of non-residents living in those states. The state's population is shown in the percentage of the population that lives in that state and the percentage that lives elsewhere in the country. seats was to be allocated to the District of Columbia. The other seat would be assigned either by using the normal apportionment formula allocation procedure ( H.R. 157 ) or specifying that the seat would been allocated to Utah. This would add a fourth seat to Utah's three ( S. 160 ). While both versions treated the D.C. as if it were a state for the purposes of the allocation of House seats, each bill restricted the District to one of its four seats. (beginning in January 2013) Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania will each lose one seat; New York and Ohio will each losing two seats. Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, South Carolina, Utah, and Washington will each gain one seat. Florida will gain two seats; and Texas will gain Texas. Arizona will gain one seats; Florida will lose two seats, and Texas loses one. Arizona and Georgia will gain three seats each; Florida loses two. a seat do not change if DC is treated like state, as DC is entitled the constitutional minimum of one Representative. DC is also entitled to a seat in the House of Representatives if it is treated as a state. DC currently has one seat in Congress, which would change if it were to become a state, but not if it was treated like a city. DC has one Representative in the Senate, which could change if the state were to be considered a city, and one in the state legislature. to a single congressional seat under any future apportionments. Similar bills had been introduced in the 110 th Congress. On April 19, 2007, the House approved H.R. 1905 by a vote of 241 to 177 (Roll Call vote 231) and sent it to the Senate. The Senate passed the bill on April 20, 2007. The bill was passed by the Senate on April 21, 2007 and sent to the White House to be signed by President George W. Bush. The House of Representatives passed it on April 22, 2007 by a Vote of 241-177. On June 28, 2007, S. 1257 was reported out of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs with amendments. cloture on the motion to proceed to consideration of the measure was not invoked in the Senate on a Yea-Nay vote, on September 18, 2007. The measure was never brought to the Senate floor for consideration. The bill was signed into law on July 31, 2008, by President Barack Obama. It was passed by the House of Representatives on July 30, 2008. When Alaska and Hawaii were admitted in 1959 and 1960 the House size was temporarily increased to 437. In 1961, when the President reported the 1960 census results and the resulting reapportionment of seats in the reestablished 435-seat House, Alaska was entitled to one seat, and Hawaii to two seats. Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Missouri each received one less seat than they had been in the previous Congress. This modern precedent differed from the state admission acts passed following the censuses in the 19 th and early 20 th centuries which provided that new state to accommodate Alaska in 1960. additions to the size of the House in the 19 th and early 20 th centuries. The exceptions to this general rule occurred when states were formed from other states (Maine, Kentucky, and West Virginia). These states' Representatives came from the allocations of Representatives of the states from which the states came. These states were Maine, Kentucky and West West Virginia, and the number of Representatives in each state was determined by the state's allocation of Representatives to the House of Representatives at the time. H.R. 157 / S. 160 provided for a permanent increase in the size of the U.S. House of Representatives, from 435 seats to 437 seats. The bills specified that one of the additional House size remained at 435 Representatives. Third, if, on the other hand, the District of Columbia were to be given a vote in the House of. Representatives and treated as if it were a state, the House size would be increased to. 437. The District of. Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2009 introduced in the 111 th Congress. would have if the House size had been increased to 438 (as was proposed by H.R. 10264, in 1962). Table 1 shows a shift of 12 seats among 18 states for the 113 th Congress. First, due to population changes between the 2000 Census and the 2010 Census. Second, because of the shift in seats between 18 states and 435 seats for the House of Representatives, the number of seats in the House has been increased from 435 to 437 in the 113th Congress. The 435 seat limit for the size of the House was imposed in 1929 by statute (46 Stat. 21, 26-27) A House size of 468 would have resulted in no state losing seats for the 2010 apportionment. The measure was defeated by a vote of 42.57 - 42, leaving the measure pending. No further action occurred on the legislation. The House of Representatives has a maximum of 10,306 representatives based on the 2010 Census. The current House size is 468. At a House size of 468, California's delegation size, for example, would be 56 instead of 53 seats. Texas' delegation size would be 38 instead of 36 seats, and Florida's delegationSize would be 29 instead of 27 seats.held from the 112 th to the 116 th Congresses. General congressional practice when admitting new states to the Union has been to increase the size of the House, either permanently or temporarily, to accommodate the new states. New states usually resulted in an increase in the House size. The apportionment act of 1911 anticipated the admission of Arizona and New Mexico by providing for an increase in the House size from 433 to 435 if the states were admitted. The House size was temporarily increased to 437.representatives would be added to theapportionment totals. As noted above, the House of Representatives is now 437 members, up from 433 in 1911. The current House size is 437, down from 437 in 1911, when the act was passed. The U.S. Senate is currently 435 members, with two seats left to be allocated.
