Lecturer: We can take a two by two Hamiltonian and exactly diagonalize it. In the next lecture, we'll look at non-degenerate perturbation theory. The next lecture will be on the interactions between normal modes of a polyatomic molecule and an ordinary, ordinary,harmonic oscillator. The lecture will also look at the effect of the structural parameters in this Hamiltonian on the energy levels and properties of the system. It will be presented by Robert Field, a spectroscopist and professor at MIT. names that any educated physical chemist will know to say, oh, that's the Bixon-Jortner. And they're still alive. They're still doing beautiful stuff. But anyway, that is all I want to say today. I will do details on one mode and Morse oscillator in other sorts of things next time.

Once you have this, then you know how to write the time dependent wave function. And then there's the origin of life. You need two particles to come together and start to condense into a liquid. That's the beginning. Perturbation theory explains the long range interactions by which all gas phase particles attract each other weakly. So that's important too. And so you'll be able to do all of this stuff. So here we have non-degenerate perturbation Theory. And it is isn't just blowing smoke.
