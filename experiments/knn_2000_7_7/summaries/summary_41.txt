As a nurse we will transfuse a patient who is low on red blood cells with new blood cells via a venous access of some type. Red blood cells are very vital for our survival and how our body works so in other words our body can't function very well without them. Most hospitals require that you're a registered nurse in order to transfuse the blood so again follow your Hospital protocol with that.
