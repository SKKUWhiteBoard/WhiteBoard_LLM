The US Supreme Court is the highest federal court in the United States. The president can nominate any individual to serve. So far, six justices have been foreign-born, at least one never graduated from high school, and another was only 32 years old when he joined the bench. Most presidents nominate individuals who broadly share their ideological view, so a president with a liberal ideology will tend to appoint liberals to the court. For example, when President Eisenhower, a Republican, nominated Earl Warren for Chief Justice, Eisenhower expected him to make conservative decisions.

To be debated, dissected and debated, we need to look to the past, present and future. We need to see how far we have come and what we can learn from the past. We also need to learn from our mistakes and learn from each other. We want to be the best we can be, and we want to do it in a way that honors the past and the present. We hope you will join us in this quest.
