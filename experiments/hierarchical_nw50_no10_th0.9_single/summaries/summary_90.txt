The focus of patent examination is to determine whether the invention in a patent application satisfies the legal requirements for a patent. USPTOâ€™s manual for patent examiners requires them to conduct a thorough prior art search and directs them to consider U.S. patents, foreign patents, and nonpatent literature. Examiners are expected to complete their examination of an application in a certain number of hours. The time allotted varies depending on factors such as the technology and the seniority of the examiner.
