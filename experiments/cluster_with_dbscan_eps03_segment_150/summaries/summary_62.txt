names that any educated physical chemist will know to say, oh, that's the Bixon-Jortner. And they're still alive. They're still doing beautiful stuff. But anyway, that is all I want to say today. I will do details on one mode and Morse oscillator in other sorts of things next time. Back to Mail Online home. back to the page you came from.

In the next lecture, we'll look at non-degenerate perturbation theory. The next lecture will be on the interactions between normal modes of a polyatomic molecule and an ordinary, ordinary,harmonic oscillator. The lecture will also look at the effect of the structural parameters in this Hamiltonian on the energy levels and properties of the system. It will be presented by Robert Field, a spectroscopist and professor at MIT.
