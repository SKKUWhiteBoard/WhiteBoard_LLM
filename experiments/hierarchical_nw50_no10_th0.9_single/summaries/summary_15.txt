Medicare now covers a number of preventive services, such as immunizations. Not all beneficiaries, however, avail themselves of covered preventive services. Medicareâ€™s fee-for-service program does not cover regular periodic examinations. Despite the frequency of visits, many Medicare beneficiaries do not receive the full range of recommended preventive services for people age 65 or older. For some beneficiaries, certain services may not be warranted or may be of limited value. preventive care depends on an individual's age and particular health risks, not simply on results of a standard battery of tests.
