If certain amount of output can be produced by given amount of inputs, then the same combination of input puts can also be used to produce less. The key word is feasibility technology represents the feasibilities that the combination of inputs and outputs, that can be achieved in this world even the current level of technology fine. The second is no free lunch. At least 1 input is required to produce some output, or more than you know more than 1 kind of output. Third is non reversibility, what it means is that a production process cannot be reversed. A production plan is a combination of input and output that is feasible, not just this y does not represent just amount of output. If it exhibits convexity then t y bar and 1 minus t ybar dash is also feasible. If we have reversibility in the production process, then it would violate the laws of thermodynamics. So, in that sense all the production and processes are irreversible. We are going to talk about additivity that we talked about earlier and divisibility fine. say that there is such definition it requires either 2 man hour, and this is also not a good example, let me think of something else. To produce 1 kg of rice ok, you need either let us say 100 grams of fertilizer. So, 2 and 25 liters of water of course, we need land, but that is fixed those are fixed, we are not talking about it only these 2 are variables. So Student: Should not, has be 2 like 1kg of rice gives 1 and 2. comma 2 1 minus t 2 comma 1 will give us again 1 unit of output. So, what we are saying basically that ok, we start with y bar and y bar dash then if these 2 are feasible, then t y bar plus t ybar dash is also feasible here. The combination is all given here and this exhibits convexity. This is taking care of not only inputs but also output, y is taken care of here. It is possible to combine the two together.
