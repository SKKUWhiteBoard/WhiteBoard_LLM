Markus Klute: I'll explain how the course is structured, how you participate and how you'll be graded. To get started, this class will be taught in an inverted classroom or flipped classroom setting. It's going to be online-only so we will not have in-person opportunities to discuss. You can log in at any time and we'll discuss whatever you want to talk about. For that let's contribute to the Doodle poll, which I posed during the first time of the first class. The course evaluation or your evaluation in this course will be made up 50% out of homework. The paper presentation I was talking about will have 20 points. And then there's going to be two short oral exams. The great divide-- the great divide or the grade divide-- at 85% between A and B, 70% between B and C, 60% between C and D, and below 50% earns you an F. I don't think anybody can get into this environment as long as they participate.
