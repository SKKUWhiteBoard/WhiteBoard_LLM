Simple graphs don't have direction. They just correspond to a mutual connection, which is symmetric. An edge just has two endpoints that are in V, and we don't distinguish the endpoints. When two vertices are connected by an edge, they are said to be adjacent. The degree of a vertices is simply the number of incident edges, the number. of edges, that touch it, and the number for which its an end. point. It's a basic concept in graph theory. We're going to make a little bit of in this video segment. The handshaking lemma says that the sum of the degrees summed over all the vertices is equal to twice the number of edges. So that's the cardinality symbol. Absolute value of a set means the size of the set. E here is finite. Twice the number. of edges isequal to the sum over all. the verticing of the degree of the vertice. And the proof is trivial, but let's make something of this. You might wonder why it's called the handsh shaking lemma. That will emerge in some problems that we're going to have you do. Study: Men have 30% more partners than women, according to the US Department of Health. David Frum: "We're going to come up with a very elementary graph theoretic argument that says that this is complete nonsense" He says there is a fixed relationship between the average number of partners of men, the average degree of the M vertices and the average degrees of the F vertices. Frum says the answer seems to be that people are lying about the number of women and men.
