Coded imaging is a co-design between how you capture the image and how you process the image. The concept of a position or superposition applies to all three types, shadows- or refraction- or reflection-based techniques. We'll see how-- we already have some projects that are inspired by biological vision. And we'll see it in a taxi zipping very fast, which is a clever way to take a photo. And I believe Santiago-- where's Santiago? Oh, yeah, his triangle-- the piston. The problem is that when you use a box function to take a photo, some of the lower frequencies are actually being set to 0. The culprit here is really this box function, which is equivalent to-- when you release the shutter, opening the-- release your shutter button-- opening the shutter and keeping it open for exposure duration and closing it. So what if you change that? What if you open and close it in a carefully chosen binary sequence? So for some time, the shutter was open, then shutter's closed. It's open for sometime. Again, it's closed, open for quite some time. And so on. So at the end, you still get just one photo. But now something magical has happened because first of all, if you look at this number one, you'll see that it's not the same as before. It seems to have these replicas. Ramesh Raskar: Compressed sensing is taking a photo and compressing it. He says the idea is to take a single photo and then recover it in a compressed way. Rasksar: If you're on 2 megapixels, then you need to take 2 million [? pics] All right? So the claim this group made at Rice University was that if I wanted a million-pixel image, I don't have to really take a million readings, he says. Rasa: I can take this picture effectively with just 10,000 pixels but recreate a million pixel image.
