In order to do that, I basically have to do the integral. So here it is. We have psi of x and t. It's integral dk phi of k e to the ikx minus omega of kt. If you want to see the distortion, you have to keep that [INAUDIBLE]. We'll do that in a week from now. And then, you say, look. There's lots of things making it look like a difficult integral, but it's not as difficult as it looks. is equal to zero, it will have a peak. And that corresponds to x equals to d omega dk times t, showing again that the wave has moved to the right. So I've given two presentations, basically, of this very important result about wave packets that we need to understand. It's called the wave function at time equals 0, and it has a peak when this thing is 0, the argument. And it's called a wave packet, and we can use it to understand wave packets.
