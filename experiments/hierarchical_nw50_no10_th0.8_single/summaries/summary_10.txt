CMS reported total obligations for CMS contracts in fiscal year 2008 were $3.6 billion. Since 1998, obligations to fiscal intermediaries, carriers, and Medicare Administrative Contractors (contractors that primarily process Medicare claims) have decreased approximately 16 percent. Obligations for other- than-claims processing activities, such as the 1-800 help line, information technology and financial management initiatives, and program management and consulting services, have increased 466 percent. CMS is required to complete Medicare contracting reform by 2011.
