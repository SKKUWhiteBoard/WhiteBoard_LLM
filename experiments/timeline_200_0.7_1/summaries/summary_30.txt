hey what's going on YouTube boy Robert and my mission is to teach you everything in the kitchen now earlier this week at work I learned and I was wondering what are the fruits and vegetables I can turn in the salt as well so today so these are the fruit and vegetables we have today we have blueberries strawberries Kiwis red beets yellow beets pineapples right in fruit and cucumber this is the equipment you'll need for today you don't need one blender sheet trays mason jars parchment paper aluminum foil a spice grinder a bowl with a strainer and a plastic spatula. I did that right because the fruit was already soft and I blue knitted with water it went right through the strainer so next time I'll call it just smear it on the actual cutting board itself another cutting board the sheet tray yeah I'll smear on the key trade first but the two prettiest ones I would have to say it was probably the red beets [Music] now movies be sweeter you can blend it with sugar and but I had sort of sweetness as for these a cucumber the Brendan beets and the red beans a blue noodles with salt so they could be added to savory dishes.
