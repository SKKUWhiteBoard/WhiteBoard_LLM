In this section, we're going to talk about the relativistic Doppler effect. We make good use of our space-time diagrams, which we discussed earlier. The question is how is this being observed by an observer which is moving with a relative velocity v with respect to the source? So the question is not how this observed-- how this is seen by the source but how it is being viewed by the observer. We have to apply Lorentz transformation to the data. that the period now is given by 1 plus beta over 1 minus beta square root of that times tau. And the frequency is the inverse. So we just calculated relativistically how the period and the frequency of a wave is Lorentz transformed. We'll have 1 minus Beta over 1 plus Beta squareroot of that [? times ?] the frequency. That's how we get the period of the wave and the rate of its movement. The period is the same as the frequency, but the rate is the opposite.
