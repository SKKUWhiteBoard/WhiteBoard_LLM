In order to do that, I basically have to do the integral. So here it is. We have psi of x and t. It's integral dk phi of k e to the ikx minus omega of kt. If you want to see the distortion, you have to keep that [INAUDIBLE]. We'll do that in a week from now. And then, you probably need to think a second. And you say, look. There's lots of things making it look like a difficult integral, but it's not as difficult as it looks. absolute value of a pure phase is that. psi at x minus d omega dk k0 t comma 0. The new norm of the wave at any time t looks like the wave looked at time equals 0 but just displaced a distance. If at time, psi had a peak when x is equal to zero, it will have a peak at time. And that corresponds to x equals to d omegadk times t, showing again that the wave has moved to the right by d Omega dk times T.
