The United States experienced heavy aircraft and aircrew losses to enemy air defenses during the Vietnam War. Since the end of Desert Storm in 1991, U.S. suppression aircraft have been continuously deployed to protect fighter aircraft maintaining the no-fly zones over Iraq and Afghanistan. In 1999, during Operation Allied Force in Yugoslavia and Kosovo, these aircraft were extremely important for protecting strike aircraft from enemy radar-guided missiles. According to DOD, countries have sought to make their air defenses more resistant to suppression.
