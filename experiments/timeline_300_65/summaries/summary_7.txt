The principles of baking looks at whether using a preferment when cold fermenting is worth it. We'll make three breads one with the brief mint and two without one of the breads without the bereavement will be bulk fermented in the fridge for 24 hours. When it comes to cold fermentation versus brief mint there is no better method what is better is up to the baker. The final product will have a much lighter and airier crumb or at least it is able to and it can make for a thinner crust too. When it comes to combining Cobalt fermentation and bereavements that's where I say simply fermenting for longer is better than using prevent and then fermenting the dough in fridge. When making the final dough I did use slightly less yeast in the dough that was made with the bravement and that was to compensate for the amount of yeast coming from the bereavement itself as it rises it multiplies. If you want to find the written formula it is in the link below the video title okay we'll do the final shaping now we'll Place those in love tins we'll let them rise and that will bake them. comparison for yourself then tell us of your results you might be surprised.
