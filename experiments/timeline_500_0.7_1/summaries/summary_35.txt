In this video, we're going to compute some useful quantities for the exponential random variable. The CDF of x is the probability that X is less than or equal to little x. We use the standard formula, which is minus infinity to infinity t times fx of t dt. For this, if you evaluate the balance, 0 makes this 0, and 0 to get 1 over. And so the expectation is 1 over lambda, and so the variance is part c, so OK, so far so good. The limit as x goes to infinity-- the exponential will beat x squared. We're asked for the PDF of z, which is the max of x1, x2, and x2. The probability of the max being less than or equal to z is actually also the probability of each of these random variables individually being less. than orequal to z. So these two events are equivalent and this is true. By independence we can break this up. And we get-- all CDFs of the exponential and they all have this form.
