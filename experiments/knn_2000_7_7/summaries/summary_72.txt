William Wordsworth just reading about some of this past you know upbringing and how that influences writing. The piece that we'll read today it's heavily influenced by his past. The next piece we read is called The Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Samuel TaylorColeridge. We'll talk about the literary partnership that was that was created between Coleridges and the Mariner. "It's a lot more difficult than reading those pulpme to expect you to get out of this because this is one I probably say the top three or four most difficult pieces," he says. "It's not that it's crazy hard but it's just it's a much more difficult to read than it looks," he adds. "I don't know what you're going to do with your life after you get through this," he admits. "This is one of the most difficult things I've ever done"
