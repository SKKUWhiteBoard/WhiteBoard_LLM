GILBERT STRANG: Take a bar, a material bar. The ends of the bar are kept at temperature zero, they're frozen. Heat is flowing around in the bar, and where is it going? It's flowing out the ends. So I insulate the bar and I put it in the freezer. And I have an ordinary bar and an ordinary temperature. And the heat is escaping out the sides, so the end x equals 0 and the end f equals 1. And that's the solution. differential equation. We have a whole function to match, so we need all of those. And Fourier series tells us how to do that matching, how to find these Bk's. So that's a separate and important question, Fourierseries. Thank you for your time. Back to Mail Online home. Back To the page you came from. Back into the article you came From.
