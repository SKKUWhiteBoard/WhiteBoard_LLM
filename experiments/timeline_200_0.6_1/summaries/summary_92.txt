Mathematically, a consumer is trying to maximize his utility. And this utility maximization has to be done with respect to some constraint and the constraint the budget constraint we take P 1 x 1; P 2 x 2 should be less than or equal to I. In real life, it is possible that a person derives some satisfaction from having some money left in his pocket, but the way this problem has been framed here the personâ€™s satisfaction depends only on his level of consumption of good 1, and good 2. Student: So, what we have here is such that P 1 x 1 plus P 2 x 2 is equal to I.equal to u naught. Now let us look at these 2 problems; what is happening is so what we can do here? Student: We are varying the budget line in the other word expenditure line, budget line is also an expenditure line. So, basically, these two are dual of one another. If we solve these two, we reach to the end of the problem. same consumption bundle; it is clear. So, if we solve it what do we get? Here let us say for x 1 instead of using star let me use term M I will explain what does this M, this is x 1 m. What are the parameters P 1 P 2 and I so x 1 the optimal level of consumption of good 1 should be given as a function of parameters in this system and the parameters are P 1, P2 and I is it clear? Similarly, let me write here x 1 H again, I will explains what is H. I is P 1 x 1 plus P 2 x 2. What is e? E is nothing. We are checking we have set up the problem such that this I is equal to this u naught and what we have learned is that x 1 m P 1, P 2 I is. equal to x 1 h P 1 P 2 uNaught. This is an identity. not just equal to. this is always true. I can write it further if you pay attention to this that x1 m P1 comma P 2 and I is e of P 1 comma P2.
