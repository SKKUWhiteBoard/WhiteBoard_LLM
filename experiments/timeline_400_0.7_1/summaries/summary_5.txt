50 years ago, John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky coined the term artificial intelligence. Progress has been made, especially in the last 20 years. But we need different expertises. Not all in computer science, but in other ones. And so, this was the people that we put together from different labs, from neuroscience, from computer science,. from cognitive science, and from a number of institutions in the US. Especially MIT and Harvard. Let me tell you a bit more about the background here. This idea of merging brain research and computer science. Artificial intelligence and machine learning is the focus of a new Nature supplement. In the first five years of the center, that's the main focus. We want to understand how the answers are produced by our brain at the computational, psychophysical, and neural level. We are not yet at the point in which we can answer all those kind of questions at all these different levels. But some, we are. One example is, who is there? It's essentially face recognition. And this is an interesting problem, because we know from work, originally in the monkeys, and then with fMRI in humans.
