DHS’s efforts to strengthen and integrate its management functions have resulted in progress addressing our criteria for removal from the high-risk list. In our February 2015 high- Risk update report, we found that DHS had met two criteria and partially met the remaining three criteria. DHS subsequently met an additional criterion—establishing a framework for monitoring progress—and therefore as of March 2016, has met three criteria, as shown in table 1. We concluded in our 2015 report and continue to believe that it will be important for DHS to maintain its current level of top leadership support.
