In this video, we'll look at an application of the probabilistic method to graph theory. An independent set in a graph is a subset of vertices with no two adjacent. Caro-Wei's theorem says that every graph G contains a large independent set of size at least the following quantity: summing over all v among vertices G, 1 over the degree of v plus 1. We'll see an application and some ways to interpret this result in graph theory as well as the corollary of Turan's theorem. case when n is divisible by r, you need to do a similar construction, turns out to be best possible, and this bound can be improved slightly, but not by too much. Let us take the n vertices and split them into equal parts. And there are r parts. So here in this illustration r equals to 3. And let's put in all the edges between parts, but no edge within a part. So this is called the complete r partite graph. So you see that this graph here, one can do a quick calculation to see that it has exactly this number, 1 minus 1 over r times n squared over 2 edges.
