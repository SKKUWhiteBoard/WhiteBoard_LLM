In quantum mechanics, the spin of a particle with a vector is quantized. You find that it's square root of f times s plus 1 in units of h-bar. If you want to get an eigenvalue with the physical state of particles, which axis are the right ones to choose-- or, sensible? There's no right and wrong in this discussion. It's not 0, because you can put [INAUDIBLE] into the rest frame, where you're just basically looking at both particles from one side.
