A random variable is a number that's produced by a random process. Number of faulty pixels in a monitor is also produced from an unpredictable randomness. The number of alpha particles that are detected by a Geiger counter in a second is believed to be a random number. And finally, we'll look at the standard abstract example of flipping coins. And if I flip coins then the number of heads in a given number of flips-- let's say I flip five heads in one second. That's a random variable. flip a coin n times. The number of heads is a number that comes out of this random process of flipping the three coins. C is greater than or equal to 1 when there is at least 1 head. M greater than 0 means all the coins match. This is an obscure way of describing the event all heads, and it has a course probability 1/8. So formally, a random variable is not a variable. Or it's a function that maps the sample space to the real numbers. Random variables are mutually independent if the events that they define are all mutually independent. If I have an event A, I can package A into a random variable. The indicator variable for any event A is 1 if A occurs and 0 if A does not occur. If two events are independent, then their indicator variables are independent. That is a lovely little proof for you to verify. It's a concept of independence that holds for random variables. And it means that really I can think of events as special cases ofrandom variables.
