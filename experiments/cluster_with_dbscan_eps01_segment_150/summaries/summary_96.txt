still buy them at the hardware store. That's it. You can't buy them online. You have to buy them from the store. They are not available online. They can be bought at the store, but you have to pay for them in cash. They're not available on the internet. You must buy them in the store to get them. You cannot buy them on the Internet. They must be bought from the hardware stores. That is it. They have to be bought in the stores. Rigidity is really about the lack of motion. In infinitesimal motion, you can think about this in the absence of a motion. You need some smoothness. If there's a way to get started moving, that doesn't actually mean you could actually move. So we're going to need some linear algebra. That's one thing that's useful. So the idea is we think about rigidity-- does a linkage move or not-- to the first order. First order means first derivative.
