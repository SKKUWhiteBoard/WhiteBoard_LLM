is a challenging task, because as we saw, biomedical data covers the whole spectrum of knowledge representation and management techniques that we know about. We are trying to make the most of the data we have, and we hope that it will help us understand more about the human condition. We hope that this article will be of interest to people around the world who are interested in biomedical data and data management techniques.
