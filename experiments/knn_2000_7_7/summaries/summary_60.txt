In this video, we'll look at an application of the probabilistic method to graph theory. An independent set in a graph is a subset of vertices with no two adjacent. Caro-Wei's theorem says that every graph G contains a large independent set of size at least the following quantity: summing over all v among vertices G, 1 over the degree of v plus 1. We'll see an application and some ways to interpret this result in graph theory as well as the corollary of Turan's theorem.
