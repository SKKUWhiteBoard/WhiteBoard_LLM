Lipids are mostly hydrophobic, which can also be referred to as lipophilic. In those fatty acids, they could be fully saturated. This is a very important semi-permeable membranes are made up through the non-covalent, supramolecular association of phospholipid monomer units. If they were fully permeable, anything could come and go and they wouldn't be much use frankly. But because they're semi- permeable, only a few things can come and going without extra help.
