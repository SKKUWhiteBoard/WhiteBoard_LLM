Professor Steven Smith: I want to talk today about Aristotle's discovery of America. He says Aristotle discovered the American Constitution 1,500 or 2,000 years before it was written. Smith: Aristotle's proposal for a mixture of oligarchy and democracy seems, in many ways, to anticipate James Madison's call for a government where powers must be separated. But Aristotle's mixed constitution differs from ours still in certain important respects, he says. He doesn't so much insist, as you will see in your reading, on the actual separation of functions of government.
