Since the early 1980s, roughly half of the private-sector work force has participated in either a defined benefit (DB) retirement plan, commonly known as a pension, or a defined contribution (DC) plan, such as a 401(k) plan. In 2006, approximately 79 million—or about half of all workers— worked for an employer or union sponsoring either a DB or DC plan. Congress created two types of employer-sponsored IRAs with fewer regulatory requirements than DB and DC plans to encourage small employers to offer IRAs.
