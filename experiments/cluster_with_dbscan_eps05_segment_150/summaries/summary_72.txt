William Wordsworth was a true literary pioneer he defied the conventions of his time by insisting that poetry should be should express deep feelings about everyday experiences. The Rime of the Ancient Mariner for Coleridge was as we'll read here and for the intro for that you know Wordsworth worked with him on that it was going to be a dual credit both of them were going to get credit for it but Wordsworth had to drop out of that but some of the most famous elements of the piece still are in there and they're still a focal point. like I said we first started this particular piece talking about it you know that memory if I am dead if I'm gone think back to this time sister if you can't hear my any longer just remember what my feelings are for you. "This is one I probably say the top three or four most difficult pieces not that it's crazy hard but it's just it's a lot more difficult than reading those pulp" "My voice and my spirit will continue because you'll be experiencing all of these things and thinking in the same mind frame that I was thinking" Sister I've never lost a parent um I don't know if anyone has but I would imagine that's a big gap in your life and you may be bond a little bit more with your siblings maybe she being the only female he has a sense of protection for and so being separated you can imagine the struggle that one might have in dealing with it with the loss. Up until that point you see that the you know his passion he developed for poetry for simple country living and for the natural world was to influence him for the rest of his life.
