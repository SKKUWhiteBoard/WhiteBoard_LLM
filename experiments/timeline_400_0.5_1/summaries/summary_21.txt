Simple graphs are directed graphs where the arrows have a beginning and an end. A directed graph might have a self loop, an edge that starts and begins at the-- starts and ends at the same vertices. A simple graph has a nonempty set, v of vertices, and it has a set E of edges, but the edges now are somewhat different since they don't have beginnings and ends. An edge just has two endpoints that are in V, and we don't distinguish the endpoints.
