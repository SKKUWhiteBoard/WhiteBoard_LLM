Last week we looked at the we first saw our first magic formula which you've probably forgotten because it was a wonderful weekend so I'll remind you and um then from there we will uh resolve the spider problem and then uh we're going to solve uh the super magic formula. The Machinery I provided you is powerful enough to solve pretty much any kinematics problem because it's based purely on Geometry angular velocity is a kind of a madeup concept that just simplifies the math.
