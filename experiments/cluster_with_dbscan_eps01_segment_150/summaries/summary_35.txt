doesn't make any sense I'm not gonna do that I'm gonna goof off. I don't want it because they're facing a marginal tax rate that's really really high so which view is Keynesian new classical supply? I'll write the paper and win the Nobel Prize and I can go to Sweden and get the nice little bitty gold medallion that I couldn't wear around my neck for the rest of life at such a such recession. alright this is the end of test three material I will. CNN's John Defterios takes a look at three different views of fiscal policy. Keynesian, classical and supply-side views are shown in the atas model. The Keynesian view is based on the idea that if you borrow money and make aggregate demand increase, eventually it will increase. The supply side view is more of a Keynesian approach and focuses on what happens when aggregate demand is increased rather than how much it increases. Defterius: We have three main views of how well fiscal policy works or how well it doesn't work and we're just gonna look at these.
