In this problem, we are given a joint PDF for x and y. And then we are asked to compute the variance of x plus y. We're told we should compute this variance by using something called the law of total variance. So first, I want to focus on this term-- the conditional expectation of X plus y conditioned on x. So this is actually just x plus the expectation of y given x. And because it's uniformly distributed and because expectation acts like center of mass, we know that the expectation should be the midpoint.
