Protein three-dimensional structure and its implications for the binding of small molecules such as drugs. How can we use these basic motifs to recognize other macromolecules, other proteins and nucleic acids? We have these motifs that we could find, weight matrices for them by aligning lots of sequences. Now instead of aligning sequences, let's see what we can do by mutating both the protein part and the nucleic acid part. And then we know from the three dimensional structure that it interacts mainly with the middle nucleotides. increases the risk of Alzheimer's, and probably increases cardiovascular fitness through ApoE refers to its involvement in cholesterol metabolism and transport. The ancestral form of this, for example, found in chimpanzees at nearly 100%, is this arginine 112, instead of what's now common in human populations was cysteine 112. One explanation for that might be that our nutritional standards have changed. We now eat a lot more fatty things. And so maybe this was something that was-- this bad allele, E4, was good in chimpanzees that have different diets or lifespans. The idea of chemical diversity, in a way I hope nicely connects to where we've been with RNA arrays. RNA arrays, and the double-stranded RNA array that we used earlier in class today, can be generated in a commentorial sense. Solid phase comes up again and again in arrays. It's very obvious why you have a solid phase. You want to be able to address it by its positions in x and y on the array. And it's a fantastic way of getting purification of your products simply by washing rather than doing complicated purification procedures.
