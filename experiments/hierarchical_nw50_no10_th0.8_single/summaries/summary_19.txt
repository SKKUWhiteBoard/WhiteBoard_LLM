In r e Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001 , is a consolidated case. The case includes claims against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, several Saudi princes, a Saudi banker, and a Saudi charity. Plaintiffs argued that these Saudi defendants played a "critical role" in the September 11 attacks by giving money to Muslim groups. In August 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed dismissals of the claims against Saudi defendants. But part of the reasoning for the dismissals was later overturned, and the plaintiffs were permitted a second chance.
