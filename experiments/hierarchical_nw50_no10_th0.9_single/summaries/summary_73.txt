In 1986, the United States, the FSM, and the RMI entered into the original Compact of Free Association. Economic development and self-sufficiency were not achieved under the original compact. The defense relationship continues with, among other things, U.S. access to military facilities on Kwajalein Atoll in RMI through 2016. The amended compacts continue the defense relationship, including a amended defense relationship with the F SM and RMI that went into effect on May 1, 2004, and June 25, 2004.
