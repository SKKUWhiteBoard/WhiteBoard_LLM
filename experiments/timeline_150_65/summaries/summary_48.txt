This class will be taught in an inverted classroom or flipped classroom setting. It's going to be online-only so we will not have in-person opportunities to discuss. What you are typically used for as lectures is organized solely in short videos where I discuss concepts or methods. The videos also include a few short questions for your own self-evaluation, and we'll pick up those questions and later in recitation session. So when you meet Tuesdays and Thursdays we'll have time for recitation. to answer your questions. We'll have time to go through those [INAUDIBLE] and hopefully have a good discussion. The recitations are also used for another concept, which I'll explain on a later slide, which is your presentation of a specific paper. This is part of your homework set is to find a paper to discuss with me whether or not it fits into this class schedule, and together with a partner, have a short discussion of it. So we'll use these Tuesday and Thursday sessions for this purpose. And in addition, there's going to be an office hour on Friday. and then we'll find the best possible time for everybody involved. The course evaluation or your evaluation in this course will be made up 50% out of homework. The paper presentation I was talking about will have 20 points. This is 20 minutes, so the actual exam is only going to be 20 minutes. Again, this is being done in two groups so you have to split up the aspect of presenting-- preparing and presenting, and then also when it comes to the response and the questions. The grading scheme will not be worse than what I've given you here. The great divide-- the great divide or the grade divide-- at 85% between A and B, 70% between B and C, 60% between C and D, and below 50% earns you an F. I don't think anybody can get into this environment as long as they participate. The first one deals with the particle physics content, and the second one with the nuclear physics and experimental method as well.
