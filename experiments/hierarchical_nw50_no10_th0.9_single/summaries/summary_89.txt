Most discussions of Russian interests in Iraq focus on economic factors. Moscow has cultivated friendly relations with Baghdad since the 1960s. Baghdad owed Moscow $7-$8billion for Soviet-era arms sales during Iran-Iraq War. Russian oil companies have contracts that could be worth as much as $30 billion over 20 years to develop Iraqi oil fields. Russian firms have contractsworth billions to helpmodernize Iraq's economic infrastructure. Russia may have an interest inprinciple in opposing "unilateral" U.S. military action in Iraq.
