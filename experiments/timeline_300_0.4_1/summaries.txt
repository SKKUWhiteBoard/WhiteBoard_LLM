John ESSIGMANN: I measure my blood sugar at different times during the day. Gluconeogenesis technically means new synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors. The medicine I take is called Metformin. It has a number of targets, but one of them is one of the enzymes, called PEPCK, Pyruvate Carboxykinase, that's in the gluconeogenic pathway. The liver provides a constant stream of glucose to organs that absolutely require it, like our brain.

In this lecture, we introduce and develop the concept of independence between events. If I tell you that a certain event A has occurred, this will generally change the probability of some other event B. In such a case, we say that events A and B are independent. We will then proceed to define the independence of a collection of more than two events. Finally, we will close with an application in reliability analysis and with a nice puzzle that will serve as a word of caution about putting together probabilistic models.

No matter how gentle you try to handle your dough you will always de-gas it if only a little bit in today's comparison video we'll make 4 breads they will be made from the same dough but they will all be treated differently. The first one of the four breads will be left alone from the beginning of fermentation until it's baked. The final one will be folded shaped and degassed three times and we won't be fermenting them for the same amount of time.

Of the nearly 11,000 amendments proposed in the centuries since, only 27 have succeeded as of 2016. The founders of the United States were trying to create a unified country from thirteen different colonies. For an amendment to even be proposed, it must receive a two-thirds vote of approval in both houses of Congress. To actually change the Constitution, the amendment must be ratified by three-quarters of all states. The result of such high thresholds is that, today, the American Constitution is quite static.

As a nurse you want to be familiar with heart blocks and in this review i'm going to be talking about third degree heart blocks also known as a complete heart block. The reason is occurring is because electrical signal from the atria isn't making it to the ventricles. The person could be born with it so it could be congenital or the person has severe heart disease or they have a myocardial infarction or they're taking some type of medication that they become toxic on like digoxin.

The final contest, which is due tonight, is to design an agent that plays together with another agent to try to collect food pellets while not getting eaten by ghosts. Submissions for that, your last chance to submit are tonight at midnight. And on Thursday in lecture, we'll discuss the results. The idea behind these two lectures is to look at advanced applications. We will not quiz you on these application lectures, on the final exam, or anything like that. It's more meant to give you more perspective rather than extra study materials. Search is very prevalent in language processing, and we'll cover some of that on Thursday. Adversarial games. Learning to acquire behaviors. We'll look at some real robot behaviors in flight and in legged locomotion. And dealing with uncertainty. So AlphaGo. Today's state-of-the-art in Go is that there are computer players better than the best human players. But actually, if you went back to March 2016, that was not the case yet. And in what it did, we had to update this graph that you see at the very beginning of the course. CNN's John Defterios: How do you get a helicopter to do something like this? He says it's hard to stabilize a helicopter when you only know where you are up to a couple meters. Defterio: We set up a hidden Markov model, where we considered the state unknown. He says we can build a model for learning a bunch of parameters that predict the next state, and solve it at this point in the learning.to until this experiment was run. To learn more, visit CNN iReport. doing this. Early on, they were the only ones, as far as I know, but there's more companies now. And you can look at them on these plots and see which companies, how far along, in terms of how many disengagements they need per 1,000 miles driven. Still, so far, quite far removed from human accident rate levels. Another thing people have been pushing, as a consequence of all this, is lower power neural networks. So for example, Kurt Kuetzer at Berkeley has projects on this called SqueezeNet. If they're gigantic, use a lot of power. That's a problem. Let's see what we can do to build smaller networks to make decisions.

David Kaiser: particle cosmology is a new subfield within physics. He says it studies the smallest units of matter, the fundamental forces and elementary constituents of matter. Kaiser: The field is doing pretty well these days by other measures. Its annual budget just within the U.S. is on the order of $1 billion a year, roughly, he says. It is really a booming, booming subject of study, Kaiser says. The field literally didn't even exist 45 years ago, he adds. In 1979, two separate theorists introduced a whole new model where they didn't only cite Brans-Dicke and Higgs, they literally united them. They proposed a new model in which these two fields were literally the same. Here they're coming along almost 20 years later to say, maybe there's actually the same field in space and time, with which other matter interacts. So there's a direct coupling between this new field and this hypothetical geometrical structure. And so you can think of it as like the balance of energy between the local curvature of space and so on. He wandered into this field really accidentally. He finished his PhD at Harvard in 1970. His work was squarely in particle physics, the fancy new symmetries and new nuclear forces. He then had a sabbatical early on in his faculty career, and he happened to go to Paris. He was basically in a stranger's apartment, reading the mail, just reading papers on the coffee table. And these looked really interesting. And in fact, they sparked. his interest in gravitation and cosmology. soon, everyone. Soon, everyone will be able to play together again. Soon. Everyone will be playing together.soon. Everyone.

Judy Hoyt: We're going to discuss the accurate control and placement of active dopant regions through a process called dopant diffusion. The placement of those regions determines many of the so-called short channel characteristics of MOSFETs that we'll talk about. The doping of other materials, not just the silicon itself, but of the polysilicon gate affects things like gate depletion and limits how well the gate voltage controls the channel potential, Hoyt says. The equation numerically, essentially, for an arbitrary doping profile is 1 over the integral of the carrier concentration minus the background concentration. of cases where there are analytic solutions. We talked about the diffusion of a Gaussian profile with a fixed dose. We apply this diffusion to a constant surface concentration. And finally -- we talk about the diffusion of a complementary error function, which we apply for a constant level of surface concentration. The diffusion of this error function can be applied to a fixed level of surface concentration, or a constant level of substance on the surface, for example.

Machine learning is about how to acquire a model and acquire the parameters of a model, from data and experience. In the next few lectures, we're going to work through a sequence of different takes on machine learning that are going to highlight different subsets of the big ideas on this topic. We'll see today exactly how data kind of goes through the mill and gets turned into a model. And we'll see more in-depth examples and more structured examples of these kinds of problems later on when we talk about applications. the thing we're trying to do is to fit a curve to this data. You can always fit your data more. It's about fitting your data to the point where the patterns that you are capturing are ones which generalize to test. This is definitely over-fitting. Over-fitting shows up not just on these continuous functions. It also shows up, for example, in a hypothetical digit classification, we might say, here is an image I've never seen before. Let's use Naive Bayes to classify it. So what would we do? We'd do our running total.

We're still going to talk about transformations of matrices. We looked at one type of transformation we could utilize for solving systems of equations. Today, we'll look at another one, the eigenvalue decomposition, and on Monday, we will look at the singular value decomposition. We use a process called permutation. There's a certain class of matrix called a permutation matrix that can swap rows or columns. If I swap the rows and then I swap them back, I get back what I had before. There are lots of matrices that have this property that they're unitary. We'll see some today. We discussed how to solve systems of equations via Gaussian elimination if we want an exact solution. You're studying one of them in homework assignment now, where you know the matrix is banded. triangular form for this matrix. We'll talk next time about the singular value decomposition, which is another sort of transformation one can do when we don't have these complete sets of eigenvectors. You'll get a chance to practice these things on your next two homework assignments, actually. So it'll come up in a couple of different circumstances. I would really encourage you to try to solve some of these example problems that were in here. Solving by hand can be useful.

There are 3 possible outcomes among the 8 outcomes of heads and tails with 3 coins. The probability that C greater than or equal to 1 is 7/8. And when the outcome is translated into a real number that you think of as being produced as a random variable, it's what the random variable does.

The question becomes whether can we find the solution directly from any four point correspondences such that the solution is unique? The answer is yes and it was formulated by quan at all in a paper that was published in the 1990s.

And this distance is only 22 and1/2 meters, so we find that this is a tiny, tiny,tiny effect. to know more about this, you can, for example, look up a small description in Wikipedia here. But there's quite some literature on those experimental tests [INAUDIBLE] There's a lot of information on the subject on Wikipedia. It's a very interesting area of research.

And so the expectation is 1 over lambda, and so the variance is part c, so OK, so far so good.

Professor: Can you explain the physical significance of the crystal momentum? Professor: The information about the momentum can be encoded in these spatial variation of the phase of the wave function. Professor: A central property from the Schrodinger equation is at the time variation d dt of p is equal to the expectation value of minus d the potential of x d x. The momentum expectation value is time independent, so it can be written in the form of e cubed, equal to e to the minus i upon h bar p l. give you one quick observation and then move on to the punchline of today. We've talked about identical particles before. And we've talkedabout identical particles in funny states. So for example, imagine I have two particles described by a wave function where the first particle could be in the state a and the second particles in theState b. And I can build aWave function for the first particles being in state a. And this tells us something totally awesome. But if I've taken these particles, put them in this entangled state, and sent one particle off to a distant planet, the second particle to my sister in DC, this should be yet another moment of serious discomfort. Einstein moved to Princeton in 1933. He left Germany in 1932 December, about three weeks before Hitler took power. He created a thought experiment which we're going to study in detail next week called the EPR experiment. And I want to share with you a really lovely description of the way the problem was represented in a way by-- this is from a book that I recommend to all of you. It's actually really hard to find. I was going to read you his actual quote. Now I'm just going to paraphrase it.

The assignments, [inaudible] are they limited to TensorFlow? asked the question if, if the assignment is limited toTensorFlow. If you have any questions about getting setup without feel free to use the Piazza channel. We also released a tutorial for how to just sort of set up your machine last week. Deep Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks are both used extensively in deep reinforcement learning. In 1994, we had TD backgammon which used Deep Neural Networks. And then we had the results that were kind of happening around like 1995 to maybe like 1998, which said that, "Function approximation plus offline off policy control, plus bootstrapping can be bad, can fail to converge" So I think it sort of really changed the story of how people are perceiving using this sort of complicated function approximation. could be super tempting to try to start, by like implementing Q learning directly on the ATARI. Highly encourage you to first go through, sort of the order of the assignment and like, do the linear case. Even with the smaller games, like Pong which we're working on, um, it is enormously time consuming. It's way better to make sure that you know your Q Learning method is working, before you wait, 12 hours to see whether or not, oh it didn't learn anything on Pogge.

In this section, we're going to talk about the relativistic Doppler effect. We make good use of our space-time diagrams, which we discussed earlier. The question is how is this being observed by an observer which is moving with a relative velocity v with respect to the source? So we have to apply Lorentz transformation. And we find then-- this is a little bit of an algebra exercise here-- that the period now is given by 1 plus beta over 1 minus beta square root of that times tau.

Political philosophy is the oldest of the social sciences. It can boast a wealth of heavy hitters from Plato and Aristotle to Machiavelli, Hobbes, Hegel, Tocqueville, Nietzsche. The study of the great books or great thinkers of the past can easily degenerate into a kind of antiquarianism, into a sort of pedantry, says Professor Steven Smith. But these works provide us with the most basic questions that continue to guide our field, he says. "The ideas of John Maynard Keynes, both economists and political philosophers, when they are right, are more powerful than is commonly understood," says Smith. see you back, and have a very good but thoughtful September 11^(th).

Ahern: I have never had an exam where I had fewer questions. There were maybe 10 questions I got on the exam and that was for a class of this side. I find most students are honest. I've only had a handful of situations where in this class, where I've had dishonesty as an issue. The only students I've ever had with serious dishonesty issues actually were in smaller classes interestingly enough. But it has happened here and I do have taped evidence when it does happen. So that's why I do it. Business of creating nucleophiles is not unique to proteases. One of these is an enzyme we've been talking about some already, that's the carbonic anhydrase. Students: Would you like a joke? Ahern: Yeah. Okay, so let's stretch. So this my, this is my magic genie joke, alright? This is not a computer joke. Depends on where you lean, I suppose. "This is really awesome, "I'm a really powerful guy. "I want every woman to love me." and poof, he turns into a box of chocolates. Carbonic anhydrase can catalyze the conversion of a million molecules of substrate into product per second. Most enzymes have a fairly narrow pH range where they work that's ideal. At pH 9, the enzyme is far more active than it is at pH 7, indicating that a very, very important step is the removal of that proton. The rate of formation of the nucleophile is the critical step in the catalytic action of this enzyme like that of the proteases that you saw before.

RAFAEL JARAMILLO: Let's talk about intermediate phases and line compounds. He recalls intermediate phase in a three-phase system. He says the solution model becomes very narrowly shaped, like a pin. All possible common tangents are going to converge at the same point, he says. "I no longer need a solution model. I only need one point," Jaramillo says. 'I can't help myself. I got to draw the mouse-face plot' Magnesium nickel system has a number of different phases. At high temperature, this Laves phase develops some width. But when you drop down to low temperature, both of these intermediate phases appear as line compounds. These are very distinct structures, and they're only occurring at very distinct compositions. That's a hallmark of an intermediate phase. That is a line compound. Let's talk about compound formation energy. It is the free energy change for formation of 1 mole of compound from elements in their reference states. There's an infinity of examples of line compounds. Silicon tends to be a pretty useful additive for copper-based alloys. Doping semiconductors is why we're able to talk to each other over there. Without doping, there is no semiconductor devices, and no electronics revolution. So the fact that you can dope some metals into silicon is as important as the solubility limits can be in the parts per billion. It's a very famous line compound, so on the last P set, you're going to do some problems. RAFAEL JARAMILLO: I want to introduce this and get this in your minds. Let's imagine reacting metal M with 1 mole of oxygen to form an oxide. So zM plus O2 gas reacting to form MzO2. What's z? How do I determine z? Anybody? Does anyone know some oxides? Name for me a common oxide that you know. And these oxides are line compounds. That z is not a variable. We're going to use this property of being line compounds in Wednesday's lecture.

Summary:
A random variable can take different numerical values depending on the outcome of the experiment. Some of the possible numerical values of a random variable will be more likely than others. We will describe these relative likelihoods in terms of the so-called probability mass function, or PMF. The PMF is also sometimes called the probability law or the probability distribution of a discrete random variable. We use a subscript, X, to indicate which random variable we're talking about. And it has a probability. And in our case this probability is equal to 1/2.

Protein three-dimensional structure and its implications for the binding of small molecules such as drugs. How can we use these basic motifs to recognize other macromolecules, other proteins and nucleic acids? We have these motifs that we could find, weight matrices for them by aligning lots of sequences. Now instead of aligning sequences, let's see what we can do by mutating both the protein part and the nucleic acid part. And then we know from the three dimensional structure that it interacts mainly with the middle nucleotides.

Say alpha consists of momentum p1 and PN-- or pm, and beta, say momentum p m plus 1 and pn. And then you can get this scattering amplitude just by taking your momentum-space correlation function, OK, for the n points. So this is obtained by doing a Fourier transform. So any questions on this? Yes? AUDIENCE: So can you explain again why this diagram, like, you have one branch and then there's a loop?

So far, six justices have been foreign-born, at least one never graduated from high school, and another was only 32 years old when he joined the bench. Most presidents nominate individuals who broadly share their ideological view, so a president with a liberal ideology will tend to appoint liberals to the court. Of the 112 justices who have held the position, not one has yet been removed from office.

We will be doing a bit more polling along the way, mainly to get feedback of how you feel about the class. And so hopefully, this will give you enough information to decide this is a field you would like to pursue in your future career. The class will be held every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon from 2:30 to 4:00. Risk management, nowadays, becomes pretty widespread responsibility. Even if you are not a finance guy, you work in a corporate, you just do you import, export, or building a factory, you have to know, actually, what the exposure is. How much capital are you using, what are the risks? What are the events that can actually get you into big trouble? So you will hear this "Va" concept in some of the lectures, which is also a very important issue nowadays. Vasily Kuznetsov: Arbitrage is really to find the relationships between prices, and try to profit from those relationship mispricing. He says the systematic trader builds computer models. Kuznets: Math is very useful in risk management, which I will give you some quiz -- questions -- to test your knowledge of the market. He adds that math plays a very important role to quantify how much exposure you have to the risks you have in your bank account or in the stock market. what we had, we had the noisy observation of broker data and it was coming out at different non-uniform times. So, we decided to use Kalman filter and to study how it can predict. And that's one of the nice graphs [INAUDIBLE] produced, which again, we will use this strategy and the Kalman filters which he constructed in our e-trading platform in Moscow. Just to remind, the website is fully functional. We will be posting a lot of materials there. Probably most lectures will be published there.

The size of the ribosome is similar to the size of a rhinovirus. There are many features in this part of the sequence that are very important for translation. Exonucleases might end up chewing up your transcript, but that probably suggests that the messenger RNA has been retired and it's going to retire to a better place. And this, once again, plays other functional roles with respect to being recognized as a transcript and helping to get out of the nucleus of the cell. "I think this field is fascinating. Once you get used to the mechanics of it, it's really cool to think of how you go from DNA to RNA to folded proteins," he says. "Don't forget my office hours on Monday if you need them," he adds.

Professor Donald Kagan: We are living in the early years of a polis sometime in the eighth century B.C. The date that's typical for the general phenomenon of colonization coming out of the mother cities of Greece is 750 roughly. The earliest date according to Greek tradition, if my memory is correct, was something like 773 where the Greeks date the foundation of what they thought was the earliest colony they ever established -- a place that they called Pithaecusa, which is the island of Ischia. Syracuse is an independent polis, autonomous, self-governing, whatever regime it wants, etc. It is not a subject of anybody, not Corinth or anybody else. The most typical, the usual, everything else is an exception is that there are friendly relations between the mother city and the apoikia. Syracuse finds itself besieged by the Athenians. They go to Corinth asking the Corinthians to please help us. The Corinthians are free; they will be violating no law or sacred bond if they say, sorry we really don't feel like doing that.

At the very end of uh last lecture we were talking about key value stores and uh the cool thing about keyvalue stores is they're very simple in interface excuse me. Security is basically computing in the presence of an adversary so i'm assuming several of you have all taken 161. Security is basically using those mechanisms to prevent misuse of resources so for instance virtual memory is a mechanism that can be used for protection. One of the questions that's important is do you know where your data came from that's a provenance question. Data integrity is making sure that the data read only by authorized users so that's an important thing. Non-repudiation is a surprisingly important thing that people don't often talk about. me i'm going to show you shores factoring in one slide so this is something that would break rsa okay we can basically say the difficulty of factoring rsa is figuring out how to take a large number which is publicly known and factor it into two large factors that are primes. If you can do that you break the cryptography so classically this is an exponential time algorithm and so as long as these are big enough nobody's going to break it quantum computer can do it polynomial time. question is is this something to worry about the answer is well so far no but it's looking like um it's getting closer and closer okay. We actually investigated ways of optimizing that and we could actually look at performance of different options for the shortest factoring algorithm as quantum circuits. So we built a cad tool to do that so um i i don't know i think it's a pretty interesting area right now and there's a lot of interest in it all right so um sorry i kept you guys way over but this is the last lecture i figured if anybody was interested we talked about key value stores.

Early astrologists did not recognize the lymphatics so they thought there are only three system there is a branch of portal or this branch of puerto bean. Originally doctors thought that every corner these three things are present and they call it portal triad. But later on of course the new it is not portal Triad it is portal triads. The liver is really working is that right that blood is again there are two input system hepatic arterial input and what was this portal venous input.

So in the next portion of today's lecture we're going to talk about how we can modify the policy gradient calculation to reduce its variance. In this way we'll obtain a version of the policy gradients that can be used as a practical reinforcement learning algorithm. The first trick that we'll start with is going to exploit a property that is always true in our universe which is causality causality says that the policy at time t prime can't affect the reward at another time step t if t is less than t prime.

Today we're gonna talk about learning in the setting of games. What does learning mean? How do we learn those evaluation functions that we talked about? And then, er, towards the end of the lecture, we wanna talk a little [NOISE] bit about variations of the game- the games we have talked about. So, uh, how about if you have- how about the cases where we have simultaneous games or non-zero-sum games? And an example of that is rock, paper, scissors. Can you still be optimal if you reveal your strategy? look at them, would be useful for projects. And with that, I'll see you guys next time. Back to the page you came from! Back to Mail Online home.

Summary:
The famous example was posed by Comte de Buffon back in the 18th century. It marks the beginning of a subject that is known as the subject of geometric probability. The problem is pretty simple. We take a needle that has a certain length-- l-- and we throw it at random on the plane. The needle might fall this way, so that it doesn't cross any line, or it might fall that way, and it ends up crossing one of the lines. If the needle is long enough, it might actually end up crossing two of the Lines. that these days, physicists and many engineers use methods of this kind quite often and in many important applications. The method is used in a variety of scientific and engineering applications.

Professor: We're describing interaction between the electromagnetic field and atoms. He says the problem of resonance can be "fixed" by adding an imaginary part to the energy level. Professor: I want to show you what are the tools to treat those infinity source divergences in a consistent and a systematic way. He explains how to calculate the Fourier transform of the time evolution operator to infinite orders, and how to sum up an infinite number of diagrammatic tricks and summation. The course is part of MIT OpenCourseWare, which offers free online classes. Professor: In general, a real part and imaginary part. It's a function of the initial energy E. And it has an imaginary part plus or minus eta. And what we're doing here is-- but I'm not really explaining it mathematically-- we have played those tricks here. But I hope it becomes clear if I say what the real and imaginary parts are. And the real part has actually-- remember when we discussed the AC Stark shift. The AC Stark Shift has a 1 over [INAUDIBLE] dependence. processes. OK, any last questions? Well then, let's enjoy the open house with incoming graduate students, and I'll see you on Monday.

David KAISER: Today, we're going to pick up where we were on the most recent classes. We'll look at the coalescence of what came to be called the Big Bang model. And then we'll see how cosmic inflation emerged from that particular moment to try to address some of the shortcomings while retaining some the successes. And the asterisks are to remind you there's a set of strictly optional lecture notes on the Canvas site which go into a little bit more detail of some of these parts from the lecture. 20 years later, two radial physicists working at Bell Labs, Robert Wilson and Arno Penzias, were using a new horn antenna sensitive to radial microwave and radial band frequencies. They were interested in the evolution of nearby galaxies. But they found this remnant hum in their electronics. This residual hum in your receiver consistent with an energy of about three degrees above zero, three degrees Kelvin, was really the leftover photons from the Big Bang that had been streaming freely for the next 14 billion years.

The Peloponnesian War was fought in 431 BC. After the war, Spartan power had grown to an unprecedented degree. For the first time there were lots of Spartans, who had lots of money. The Spartans had choices that they could take. They could either stay in the Pelop onnesus, or they could contest it in their power to control the entire Greek world in the east. Or they could have some control of the Aegean and the Hellespont.

The coherent state has a simple definition, simple but subtle. It's an eigenstate of the annihilation operator, and it has a complex eigenvalue alpha. The person who popularized those states was Glauber, and he got amply rewarded for that. We are now using the coherent states to look at any other quantum state of the electromagnetic field, any statistical operator which describes photons by forming the diagram matrix element of the statistical operator with alpha. And now we realize that coherent states are not as wonderful as I believe.

The first thing we want to talk about is how can we sample and quantize a continuous time signal. We then go into some geometric signal Theory with Transformers and finally how how we can kind of generate sounds using these. The next thing we're going to kind oftalk about is changing forms. We'll talk about the SARS ADC algorithm and how it's used to convert digital signals to analog.

Professor: The amygdala is closely connected to the basal forebrain. Professor: The abnormal brain connections that we know occur, at least many types of schizophrenia. He says the earlier the lesion, the greater the plasticity, the more chances of sprouting the connections that are the basis for this idea. In green, there are the very widespread catechol-oligosynaptic projections, which show the extent of the brain's plasticity. In blue, the acetylcholine containing neurons that you see in the medial septum, which we mentioned last time. unique in that way. And it's critical for the balance of this system. So anything that goes wrong with the subthalamic nucleus can cause major problems with movement. OK, so let's stop there today. We're going to take a break from talking about the human body.

The other is thinking about Locke and the American regime and the current state of political philosophy, modern contemporary American political philosophy. Smith: Locke doesn't endorse necessarily one particular form of government from any other. He is an advocate of what we have come to call limited government, of constitutional government.

Summary:
JACK HARE: Let's do a little recap on electron cyclotron emission. We expect to have multiple different peaks, even from a single particle. These peaks are going to be occurring at frequencies. And we can say this is m equals 1, m equals 2,. m equals 3. And they're evenly spaced. And so, we have these peaks here. But if we neglect that, the frequency depends only on the magnetic field. So, if you see some emission at some certain frequency, then you know that it's been emitted by a region of plasma which has this magnetic fields. Many oscillations. And so, it will average out to 1 or something like that. So it's some DC offset that we can subtract off after. So all this is doing here is mixing the signal down so it gets to a regime that we could effectively digitize. Yeah, another question. STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] JACK HARE: So if we were doing geometric optics, which we're not, then you would have a lens like this. That lens could collimate your beam. And if it collimated that beam, that would mean there'd be a focus point at some distance f away. very small region on the order of 100 microns. Anyone know how micro splitters work? Looking at you? STUDENT: RF. JACK HARE: The answer I got was RF, which I don't think is much more satisfying than my answer. So let's get on to correlation ECE see what that does. And this is where the correlation comes in. We are going to find that the noise is uncorrelated at random, but at less than the length of the scale. Bremsstrahlung is an isotropic radiation. It emits photons as it's deflected from its trajectory. There are lots of different ways to deal with the radiation. All give the same answer with just a very slightly different coefficient. So it's not really a big difference if you design your reactor. But, from the point of view of this course, it makes no difference. So, again, if you want the full treatment, go have a look in Hutchinson. difference between those. neutron damage leads us to use much thicker substrates, which gives us a longer time response and so, therefore, a worse bolometer. So, ironically, the bolometers that will be used on [INAUDIBLE] are significantly worse than the bolometer used on existing devices. And I'm sure that [? Spark ?] will have exactly the same problem. Almost everyone in the world uses this design of bolometer that they pioneered on ASDEX Upgrade in the '80s. No one has come up with a better system yet.

So, last time we were starting to talk about the sort of the general overview of what reinforcement learning involves. We introduced the notion [NOISE] of a model, a value, and a policy. Can anybody remember off the top of their head what a model was in the context of reinforcement learning? So what we're gonna do today is, sort of, um, build up for Markov Processes, up to Markov Decision Processes. And this build, I think, is sort of a nice one because it allows one to think about what happens in the cases where you might not have control over the world.

Professor: angular momentum is a set of operators that provide observables, things we can measure. He says they're particularly important for systems in which you have central potentials. Professor: If you have two energy for every system except for every energy except for 0, you have a problem. You know the problem, if you can uniquely characterize the states of the system, then you can learn more about the physics of this state, he says, and you can also know more about physics of a circle.

Summary:
There are three common uses of a rotation matrix. The first is to represent an orientation. The second is to change the frame of reference of a vector. And the third is to rotate a vector or frame. To demonstrate these, I will use these three coordinate frames, representing the same space with different orientations. To help you visualize these frames in 3 dimensions, I’ll use my handy tinkertoy frame. This is the z-axis, this is the x-axis and the y-axis. we will learn how to represent the angular velocity of a frame. We will also learn about how to use the frame to represent a frame's angular velocity. We'll also look at how the frame is used to represent an object's speed. We hope you will join us for the next few weeks of classes on how to work with a frame in this class. The next class will be on the physics of the frame in which we are working. The final class will take place in the next week or so.

Summary:
Coded imaging is a form of a co-design between how you capture the image and how you process the image. In the Fourier domain, convolution in the image domain is multiplication in the standard Fourier transform. If you have a sharp photo and a blurred photo, you can basically represent that as asharp photo. The concept of a position or superposition applies to all three types, shadows- or refraction- or reflection-based techniques. It's a way to recover the sharp detail afterwards in software. digitally. In 1D, the Fourier transform is flat, and almost all of them are the same. Now we're saying, think about the problem in 2D. And what is that function of focus? If we had to know how much is blur, we would have to know the plane of focus. And that's the magic of a broadband code. The bokehs are-- it depends on your-- I mean, for your average consumer, I don't know whether this matters. But you're right. Ramesh Raskar: Compressed sensing is taking a photo and compressing it. He says the idea is to take a single photo and then recover it in a compressed way. Rasksar: If you're on 2 megapixels, then you need to take 2 million [? pics] All right? So the claim this group made at Rice University was that if I wanted a million-pixel image, I don't have to really take a million readings, he says. Rasa: I can take this picture effectively with just 10,000 pixels but recreate a million pixel image. which is how to write a paper and wishlist for photography.

Prof. Clark: Middle class was a form of self-identity that was constructed in the way being a worker was constructed, or being a noble. When you see Daumier or you see Delacroix's famous, Liberty Leading the People, and you see the bourgeois, there with his top hat, he's dressed in a bourgeois uniform like this. That emerges out of the bourgeois century. The middle classes started dressing like this in the nineteenth century, dark with a little bit of color. Once we've got an increase in the wealth of the middle classes, then you wanted the political power.

Summary:
In automotive design Dynamics plays a very important part because it's not rigid body Dynamics it's a bunch of rigid bodies with springs the Springs are called starts with an S suspens suspensions right and there's a trade-off between how comfortable the ride is and how tightly the car handles. In Dynamics there two sides to it one is how will its various degrees of freedom behave over time if you you know stretch it and let it go and it goes twang you know boing right and you want to figure out how it goes in time that that's analysis. I'm referring to something with no Dimensions but with a finite Mass you know that someone asked me the other day and I just want to be sure to say this. Let's say that you have a particle Point Mass heading that way some direction and let's define its velocity we'll call it a v p okay so I have um two questions both of which you probably know the answers to the first is what is the angular momentum of that particle just from your memory go ahead say it aha. This is a really badly designed classroom in the sense that there's not enough room but it's a huge classroom so I'm going to write it big right and I'm not that neat so you're going to have to bear with me. 99% 99% of all engineering graduates who take a car class in Dynamics Berkeley Stanford Princeton might not even see this there is this term and you need to know about it okay it just so happens the term vanishes in many situations. I'm just rearranging terms get this guys plus a pesky term so tell me is a to work equal to rate of change of angular momentum nor in general. call this Theta the initial length is L one and the initial velocity is we'll call it a scalar because this is how I'm defining the problem of V1 when we actually solve it we might have to define a vector okay. As the thing's going around this person is going to pull the string down and as it kind of goes around it's going to spiral in and end up it's a new length L2 and the question is what is V2 going to be okay.

Summary:
Andrej Karpathy: In this module, I'm going to briefly introduce the idea of differentiable programming. Differentiable programming is closely related to deep learning. It allows you to build up an increasingly more sophisticated model without losing track of what's going on. So let's suppose you want to do image classification. We need some way of representing images. To fix this problem, we introduce convolutional neural networks which is a refinement of fully connected neural networks. So here is an example of ConvNet in action. encourage you to consult the original source if you want kind of the actual, the full gory details. Another thing I haven't talked about is learning any of these models. It's going to be using some variant of stochastic gradient descent, but there's often various tricks that are needed to get it to work. But maybe the final thing I'll leave you with is the idea that all of differentiable programming is built out of modules. Even if you kind of don't understand or I didn't explain the details, I think it's really important to pay attention to the type signature of these functions.

So for example, there are what are called bilabial sounds. These are sounds which are made with both lips. And so that's what you do for the sounds that are at the beginnings of words like "paint" and "bath," and "mouth," and well, "wipe"

Expectation is a basic question that will come up again and again when we look at random variables and probability theory. We're imagining n independent flips of a coin with bias p. The probability of heads is p. It would be biased in favor of heads if p is greater than 1/2. And we want to know how many heads are expected. So what's the expected number of heads? Well, we already know-- we've examined the binomial distribution B n,p.

Aristotle was born 384,15 years after the trial of Socrates. He was sent by his father to go to college. Unlike most of you, Aristotle did not spend four years at the Platonic Academy. He remained attached to it for the next 20, until the death of Plato. Unlike his intellectual godfather, Socrates, who wrote nothing but conversed endlessly, Aristotle wrote disciplined and thematic treatises on virtually every topic. He collected constitutions, 158 of them in all, from throughout the ancient world.

In real life, it is possible that a person derives some satisfaction from having some money left in his pocket, but the way this problem has been framed here the person’s satisfaction depends only on his level of consumption of good 1, and good 2.

Already a few outliers can lead to a environment model which is completely unusable for doing any navigation task so where the geometry of what you computed doesn't fit to the real world geometry anymore and one of the questions actually how to handle that.

Summary:
John Stuart Mill is the principle expositor of neoclassical utilitarianism. The rights-utility synthesis signals that we're looking for an attempt to put together both a commitment to utilitarian efficiency that's grounded in science on the one hand, and respect for individual rights that's grounding in the workmanship ideal on the other hand. At the same time, more or less, there were very important developments in moral philosophy that I just want to alert you to. The doctrine that I'm mentioning here is the doctrine that would come to be called emotivism. Prof: These indifference curves cannot cross. Can anybody tell us why? Why can't they cross? Wait for the mic. Student: Because at the intersection they should have the same utility. Prof: So you've got a kind of contradiction on your hands, is that right? Student: Yeah. Professor: Okay, and just to spell out the contradiction more emphatically--I think you basically made the point. So we have a distribution here, okay? Now what Pareto said, he said, "Let's draw a line north-south through the status quo"

Summary:
HONG LIU: Today, we talk about chiral fermions. He says the Dirac equation requires, actually, psi to have four components. But there are two ways to reduce it, and one is called the Majorana fermion, he says. HONG LIu: You don't need four components to be able to transform under Lorentz. You just need a smaller unit, OK? He says this tells you that at least two components already can transform.

Summary:
The best-case scenario for expansionary fiscal policy is when there are lots of underemployed resources in the economy. By increasing spending, the federal government can try to counteract falling aggregate demand. In one scenario, government spending doesn't have to be as large as the fall in "C," or consumption, to counteract the recession, and that's because of the multiplier effect. But, as always, shifting lines on a graph is much easier than shifting around real resources in a multi-trillion dollar economy.

Sarah thread sterner shows you how to wear and take off a mask. She explains how to determine which part of the mask is the front versus the back. She also shows how to mold the nose piece of the face mask with the finger tips of both hands. Finally, she shows you the best way to remove the mask by placing it over your ears and pulling it under your chin when removing the mask it's important to remember that the front is considered contaminated so remove it with the fingertip and then perform hand hygiene.

Summary:
In this lecture, we're going to talk about how neurons function and how researchers are able to control that function in order to modify behavior. Then we'll talk about synapses and how synapses function to communicate between neurons. And this is going to involve also sort of understanding how certain antidepressants, like Prozac, work. And then we'll end by talking about how researchers did this experiment to wake up the mouse. It all starts with something that I told you about at the beginning of the semester, which is that the plasma membrane separates distinct compartments.

Summary:
In this problem, we're going to be dealing with a variation of the usual coin-flipping problem. But in this case, the bias itself of the coin is going toBe random. And we're told that the expectation of this bias is some mu and that the variance of the bias isSome sigma squared. And what we'll be asked is find a bunch of different expectations, covariances, and variances. We'll see that this problem gives us some good exercise in a few concepts, a lot of iterated expectations.
