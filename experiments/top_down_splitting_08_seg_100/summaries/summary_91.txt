Prepositioned equipment and supplies are strategic assets for projecting military power. Military equipment and infrastructure are often located in corrosive environments. Estimates of corrosion costs DOD-wide have ranged from $10 billion to $20 billion annually. The Army and Marine Corps have taken some measures to reduce the impact of corrosion on prepositioned assets, but the Army could increase its use of storage facilities for land-based assets, authors say. They say temporary shelters may be a feasible option to address immediate storage needs.
