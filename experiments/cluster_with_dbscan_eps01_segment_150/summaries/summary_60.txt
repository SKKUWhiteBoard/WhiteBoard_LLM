minus 1 minus 1 over r times n. And this quantity here equals to r. So there's a strict equality sign here. In particular, G has a clique of size strictly greater than r, and that finishes the proof of Turan's theorem. Turanâ€™s theorem is a important and foundational result in graph theory. And it's a start of a subject that we now call extremal graph theory, concerning what can you say about a graph that has certain properties, like not having a large clique? In this video, we'll look at an application of the probabilistic method to graph theory. An independent set in a graph is a subset of vertices with no two adjacent. Caro-Wei's theorem says that every graph G contains a large independent set of size at least the following quantity: summing over all v among vertices G, 1 over the degree of v plus 1. We'll see an application and some ways to interpret this result in graph theory as well as the corollary of Turan's theorem.
