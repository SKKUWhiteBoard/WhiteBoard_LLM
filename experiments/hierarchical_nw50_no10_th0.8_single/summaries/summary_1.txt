J-1 visas allow foreign nationals to participate as exchange visitors in cultural and educational programs in the United States. These physicians are required to return to their home country (or to their country of last legal residence) for at least 2 years after completion of training. However, they may obtain a waiver of this requirement and remain in the U.S. For most physicians, the waivers are requested on their behalf by a federal agency or by a state their behalf. The number of waivers being processed for physicians to practice in underserved areas each year has grown from 70 in 1990 to374 in 1995.
