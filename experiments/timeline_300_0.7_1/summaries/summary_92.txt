Mathematically, a consumer is trying to maximize his utility. And this utility maximization has to be done with respect to some constraint and the constraint the budget constraint we take P 1 x 1; P 2 x 2 should be less than or equal to I. In real life, it is possible that a person derives some satisfaction from having some money left in his pocket, but the way this problem has been framed here the personâ€™s satisfaction depends only on his level of consumption of good 1, and good 2. bundle, this is the bundle; let us say x star and here is let us call it also x star in the old problem. What we have done here we have taken the indifference map and then we have took the budget constraint. We have figured out that x does not or x naught 0 x star 0 is the optimal bundle. We take any bundle here the expenditure is going to be the same in both of these cases, that is what it represents. If we solve these two, we reach to the same consumption bundle; it is clear. I is P 1 x 1 plus P 2 x 2. What is e? E is nothing. We are checking we have set up the problem such that this I is equal to this u naught and what we have learned is that x 1 m P 1, P 2 I is. equal to x 1 h P 1 P 2 uNaught. This is an identity. not just equal to. this is always true. I can write it further if you pay attention to this that x1 m P1 comma P 2 and I is e of P 1 comma P2.
