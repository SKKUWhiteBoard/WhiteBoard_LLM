Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) provide benefits to people with disabilities. DI provides benefits to workers who become unable to work because of a long-term disability. SSI is an income assistance program that provides cash benefits for disabled, blind, or aged people who have low income and limited resources. For 2006, SSA considers countable earnings above $860 a month to be SGA for an individual who is not blind and $1,450 a month for anIndividual who is blind.

Before commercialization, air navigation services under government control faced increasing strains. In some instances, the country as a whole faced widespread fiscal problems. Commercialization was intended to relieve the government of a fiscal responsibility. According to ICAO, the ANSP should be encouraged to be as competitive, efficient, and cost-effective as any other commercial business. The UK established an authority before commercialization to develop one commercialized ANSP. The European Union’s “Single Sky Sky initiative” is planning to develop five commercialized AnSPs.

Offshoring, also known as offshore outsourcing, initially referred to the practice of U.S. businesses contracting with firms beyond U.s. borders. Offshoring has heightened public policy concerns about the extent of job loss and foregone employment opportunities. The notion that offshoring depresses job growth in the United States appears to lie underlie some policymakers' support for measures meant to encourage employment domestically rather than abroad, authors say. They ask whether the existing trade adjustment assistance programs can satisfactorily meet the needs of comparatively well-educated office workers who lose their jobs.

The 1986 amendments to RCRA established the LUST Trust Fund to finance the cleanup of petroleum releases from underground storage tanks. Until recently, states could use these funds only for cleanup and related administrative and enforcement activities. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the 2005 Act), enacted in August 2005, expanded the permitted uses of the Lust Trust Fund. States are responsible for overseeing cleanup work performed by the party responsible for performing the cleanup at sites where no responsible party can be found. In addition to the federal money from EPA, federal money can be used to clean up sites contaminated by petroleum by the Brownfields program.

Congress enacted Section 1085 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, which authorizes the charging of fees by one designated primary archive in each of the four military departments. The four designated archives are the Air Force Historical departments and the Marine Corps Historical Center at Washington Navy Yard, D.C. The policy provides that a charge shall be imposed to recover the full cost to the federal government of rendering a service or the fair market value of such service, whichever is higher.

Over the last 50 years there have been no major renovations or upgrades to the buildings or their systems. In September 2005, the headquarters complex was shut down and the staff sent home because a main breaker for electrical power to the top floors of the Secretariat building failed. This failure could have resulted in a major electrical panel. In addition to oversight, an effective procurement process is one of the keys to success for any large scale construction project.

Beginning in the 1930s, a number of federal housing programs have provided assistance to low-income renters and homeowners. In general, both HUD and USDA programs target families at lower income levels. However, these programs do not reach all needy households, and waiting lists for many types of subsidized housing, including housing for the elderly, are often long. A number of barriers inhibit coordination among agencies, GAO has previously reported. The federal government’s system for providing assistance tolow-income people is highly fragmented.

Unlike welfare programs, eligibility is determined on the basis of limited income, Social Security is a work-related entitlement, in which benefits are determined. In December 2012, 3.3 million Social Security beneficiaries (5.7% of all beneficiaries) were children under the age of 18. Average monthly benefit among child beneficiaries in December 2012 was $525.

Conventional transit projects generally follow a “design-bid-build” approach. The federal government has progressively relaxed restrictions on private participation in highway and transit projects serving public objectives. Much of the federal government’s share of new capital investment in mass transportation has come through the New Starts program. Through the New starts program, FTA identifies and recommends new fixed-guideway transit projects.

Full funding increases the opportunity to use performance-based fixed price contracts, allows for more efficient use of the work planning and investment, and increases the accountability for the achievement of the goals.

USDA’s CBAs provide services such as farm loans and conservation assistance. Under the E- File Act, these agencies were required to establish an electronic filing and retrieval system. The law further mandated that by June 20, 2002, agricultural producers be able to file paperwork electronically with USDA if they choose to do so. By the December 18 deadline, the CBAs had successfully established a common Internet Web site, obtained OMB approval for 52 FSA and NRCS forms, and placed them on the Internet. However, none of the 100-plus forms that theCBAs expected to have deployed on the site by the deadline were available.

User financing is one approach to financing federal programs or activities. User fees assign part or all of the costs of the benefits and services derived from these programs and activities to recipients. The fees vary in the way they are set, collected, used, and reviewed, which may affect their efficiency, equity, revenue adequacy, and administrative costs. In 2006 we reported that financial management issues at CBP and APHIS adversely affect the AQI program’s ability to perform border inspections.

Federal agencies regulate the food production chain from farms to food manufacturers. State and local agencies primarily regulate food safety in retail food establishments. The agencies’ food safety authorities stem from 30 principal laws related to food safety. In fiscal year 2003, the four federal agencies spent nearly $1.7 billion on food safety-related activities. The majority of federal food safety inspection expenditures are directed toward USDA’s programs for ensuring the safety of meat, poultry, and egg products. In contrast, FDA accounts for more than half of the food safety education expenditures.

Prepositioned equipment and supplies are strategic assets, along with sealift and airlift, for projecting military power. Military equipment and infrastructure are often located in corrosive environments that increase the deterioration of assets and shorten their useful life. Higher rates of corrosion result in increased repairs and replacements, drive up costs, and take critical systems out of action, reducing mission readiness. The Army could increase its use of storage facilities for land-based assets. Temporary shelters may be a feasible option to address storage needs.

Most residential users dial in to an ISP over a telephone line. Small business users may also connect to a backbone network through an ISP. Large businesses often purchase dedicated lines that connect directly to large businesses. Backbone providers have points of presence in varied locations. Unlike telecommunications services, the provision of Internet backbone service is not regulated by governmental communications agencies. The treatment of these more established communications services and infrastructures under the Communications Act of 1934—as amended by the 1996 act—has indirectly affected the burgeoning Internet medium.

In September 2008, ongoing financial turmoil escalated into a financial panic. Large financial institutions, such as Lehman Brothers and AIG, were failing, the stock market was falling, and credit markets seized up. The federal government responded with a series of lending and guarantee programs to mitigate the economic damage. The FDIC established the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) on October 14, 2008, to strengthen confidence and to encourage liquidity in the banking system. The TAG program provides unlimited deposit insurance for $1.4 trillion in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts (NIBTAs)

But resource allocation decisions are the responsibility of GSA, which may be unwilling to fund the countermeasures FPS recommends. Compounding this situation, FPS takes a building-by-building approach their agencies. FPS faces challenges in ensuring that its fee-based funding structure accounts for the varying types of risk services provided at federal facilities, the authors say. They say FPS’s basic security fee, which funds most of its operations, does not account for the risk faced by specific buildings.
