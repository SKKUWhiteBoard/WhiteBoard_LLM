USDAâ€™s CBAs provide services such as farm loans and conservation assistance. Under the E- File Act, these agencies were required to establish an electronic filing and retrieval system enabling farmers and other agricultural producers to access departmental forms via the Internet. By December 1, 2000, USDA was to submit to Congress a plan for enabling producers to obtain forms and information, such as crop insurance applications and production and yield reports, over the Web. By June 20, 2002, agricultural producers be further mandated to file paperwork electronically with USDA if they choose to do so.
