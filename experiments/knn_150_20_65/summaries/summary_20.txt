In this video i'm going to be covering sinus tachycardia. sinus tells us that we're dealing with a heart rhythm that originates in the sa node. The sa node is really the starting point of the electrical conduction system. If this process is occurring like it should it should cause this heart to beat at about 60 to 100 beats per minute on the ecg. On the flip side let's say that this sa nodes is disease it's causing the heart to beating slowly. waves we want to make sure that there's a p wave one p wave in front of every qrs complex. We want to look at those p waves is because they tell us about the atrial rate. Then i want to check the regularity of these qrs complexes just like i did with the p wave so i'm going to go from r wave to r wave with my calipers and i'm just going to confirm that they are regular and they're regular just like with thep wave. compensate for what's going on but in the end it's going to fail and the patient'sGoing to have cardiogenic shock and you'd want to report that to the doctor. Check out the respiratory system are they having shortness of breath whenever they breathe in. Are they having chest pain that's getting worse or are they developing a cough so you'd also want toReport that as well now to help you remember those major causes of that. assessing blood levels like the thyroid level making sure they don't have hyperthyroidism looking for anemia or maybe infection.
