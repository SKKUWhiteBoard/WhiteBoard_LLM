CASEY RODRIGUEZ: We proved two theorems last time, and we used them for-- and we had a couple of applications of them. He says we can define a positive real number to a rational power using elementary facts about the real numbers. Roddiguez: You don't need the exponential and the logarithm to make sense of a real number of power. But we're just going to use the basic properties of exponents throughout all this so we don't use derivatives.

The configuration of a particle is given by, or described by, a wave function psi of x. In 3D, the wave function would be a function of all three positions x, y and z. If there are two possible configurations the system can be in, it's possible to find the system in a superposition of those two psi is equal to some arbitrary linear combination alpha psi 1 plus beta psi 2 of X. The superposition principle is an important challenge for us in the next couple of lectures.

When you do not have unlimited amount of everything, you will have to make a choice, what to produce? In what quantity you should produce a particular good. Allocation is nothing but assignment, allotment, share, but in economics we are more technical about this particular term allocation. So, allocation here means solving these three fundamental or basic questions of economics, and the first question is what to produced? The second is how to produce and the third is for whom to produce. And depending on who makes these decisions we have different form of economy, who make these decisions.

And then, based on what that number is, they make a decision, stick with the number they have or switch to the other unknown number on the face down piece of paper, he says.

When you have images and a CNN you can simply just do convolutions instead of your normal matrix multiplication um which is demonstrated up here. and mobile nuts for Edge Computing and things like that. You want to drastically reduce the number of computations that you want to do yep that is basically everything for today thank you guys for coming oh and there will also be a quiz there will Also be a quizz at least is there a homework position closer or not [Music] um and do next Friday [ music] thank you for sure.

The third one will be made with a brief mint which will be left for 12 hours to ferment then it'll be mixed into the main dough. The breads will then take the same amount of time to make but why would you add the extra step of making a briefment when cold fermenting?

Bayard Rustin was the chief organizer of the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Rustin grew up in a Quaker household, and began peacefully protesting racial segregation in high school. He remained committed to pacifism throughout his life, and was jailed in 1944 as a conscientious objector to World War II. He joined the Communist Party when black American’s civil rights were one of its priorities, but soon became disillusioned by the party's authoritarian leanings and left. In 2013, fifty years after the March On Washington, President Barack Obama posthumously awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

JUDY HOYT: Hopefully everybody's recovered from their Thanksgiving feast. What I'm showing up here is the schedule to orient us. This is lecture 22. We'll talk about silicides, device contacts, and I've added in a new material this year on novel gate materials. And then next week we have two class periods scheduled. There'll be four speakers in each. And those will be the oral reports and the student reports given on Tuesday and Thursday. And I just want to remind people, if you're doing an oral report, you're expected to provide handouts. The resistance of a given contact in ohms is just the voltage divided by the current flowing through that contact. If I make a smaller contact area for a given specific contact resistivity, you're going to have a higher resistance. This is a problem if I'm scaling devices. Unless we do something to make better contacts as we scale devices, just because of this geometric factor. The second type of contact-- again, this is one that's not generally considered desirable, but we need to understand a little bit of the physics of it.

The dagger algorithm aims to provide a more principled solution to the imitational and distributional Shi problem. The idea in dagger is to actually run the policy in the real world see which states it visits and ask humans to label those States. The goal is to collect data in such a way that P Pi Theta can actually learn from the data it's trained on. The basic version of dagger works like this and that's the version that you will all be implementing in your homework. It's a very simple algorithm to implement if you can get those labels. It can actually get up to fly pretty reliably through a forest dodging trees.

And it's set to just take a Geigercounter and put your sources at some fixed distance away. It's a pretty good approximation to the solid angle of something for very long distances. The experiment is basically change reactor power by half a megawatt. We're currently at 500 kilowatts and we're going to bring the reactor up to 1 megawatts and then bring it back down. We have about nine different instruments that tell us what the reactor power is at all times. We'll show you the proper way to make the entries and then do the actual movement itself. And since it's linear, it'll be double that-- so 17.1 megawatts.

Bentham's principle is "the greatest happiness of the greatest number" He thinks all utility is quantifiable and expressible through money. He also has a doctrine of revealed preference, where we can vary the price to get information about your utility. Bentham allows interpersonal comparisons of utility, so we can say that if you take one unit of utility from one person and give it to another person, you can make comparisons across individuals that we can make across society. And we could even influence your behavior without actually changing your preferences, and that's a very important distinction.

CNN's John Defterios takes a look at three different views of fiscal policy. Keynesian, classical and supply-side views are shown in the atas model. The Keynesian view is based on the idea that if you borrow money and make aggregate demand increase, eventually it will increase. The supply side view is more of a Keynesian approach and focuses on what happens when aggregate demand is increased rather than how much it increases. Defterius: We have three main views of how well fiscal policy works or how well it doesn't work and we're just gonna look at these.

So I think I just spend like five minutes, just briefly review on the backpropagation last time. So I didn't have time to explain this figure, which I think probably would be useful as a high level summary of what's happening. Like this is the forward path. This is how you define network and the loss function. So you start with some example x, and then you have some-- I guess, this is a matrix vector multiplication module, and you take x inner product multiplied with w and b. And then get some activation, the pre-activation. And you get some post activation. Just draw this from scratch. So this side is the model complexity. So we say that the bias is large, it's because the model is not expressive enough. So that means that if your model is more expressive, then your bias should decrease. And now let's think about how do you draw the variance on this thing. So the question you want to answer is that if you change the model. complexity, what is the best test error, right? So it means that it's somewhere in the middle.

The goal of this course is to give you the tools to interpret complicated phenomena. We have electronic structure and the hydrogen atom as a way of understanding what electronic structure is. When we go to molecular orbital theory, we take what we know about atoms, and build a minimally-complex interpretive picture, which is sort of a framework for understanding complicated molecular interactions. The relationship between the effective quantum number and the ionization energy of a state then provides a hydrogen-atom-based structural model for everything you can observe.

Summary:
In particle physics and in nuclear physics, use a system called natural units. This system is based on fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics and special relativity. In this class, we'll use natural units in some examples, and SI units in others. This will always be clear from the problem we're looking at, so we're always looking at the problem at hand. We'll use Heaviside-Lorentz units and combine them with some measurable units we discussed in the previous class.

Last time we talked about some of the kind of the bigger questions in deep learning theory. And today, we are going to start talking about the optimization perspective in deeplearning for two lectures. The main focus is to analyze what the functions you are optimizing look like so that you can use some trivial or some standard optimization algorithm for it. The bigger question we are trying to address here is that why many optimization algorithm are designed for convex functions. But why they can still work for nonconvex functions? by the users. So let's say suppose this is a matrix that Amazon maintains, and the other side is the item. And each entry is the rating of the user to the item, and every user probably have an opinion about every item. So that's why you have to recover all the rest of the entries to serve the users better in the future. And the most used method to solve this is basically nonconvex optimization to find this ground truth matrix M using the fact that you have a low rank structure.

Iceland is one of the world's most active volcanic hotspots crafer has erupted 30 times in a thousand years and last blue in the 1980s. Scientists are now preparing to drill into it the is to learn more about how volcanoes behave so that we can better predict eruptions and also tap into a super hot source of energy volcanoes can be spectacular but they're also devastating around the world millions of people live close to them here in Iceland. Researchers here hope their work will change that helping to save lives and money while also pioneering a form of volcano power.

So this is definitely a property that we are going to be looking for in an estimator, trying to find them to be unbiased. But we'll see that it's actually maybe not enough. Something that's slightly better is the risk, really the quadratics risk, which is expectation of.

In this problem, we are given a joint PDF for x and y. And then we are asked to compute the variance of x plus y. We're told we should compute this variance by using something called the law of total variance. So first, I want to focus on this term-- the conditional expectation of X plus y conditioned on x. So this is actually just x plus the expectation of y given x. And because it's uniformly distributed and because expectation acts like center of mass, we know that the expectation should be the midpoint.

He says the most non-polynomial calculations, that is to say, in this case, in the case of this band, you could take one of the examples and take it to the next band.

Charles Brockden Brown: The Enlightenment is a critique of a kind of impoverished view of mind or consciousness that over-relies on reason. We started to look at it a little bit with Barlow's [assumed spelling] Raven poem with Poe. The idea that in fact there is something wrong with reason as a faculty, and this can take a couple of forms. One is that all of those nice ideals that come along with the enlightenment may in fact be parasitic precisely on the kinds of negative types of thinking that they are designed to get rid of.

In all of this experimentation and experimental verification, it's important to understand the importance of uncertainties in the scientific process overall, Klute says. He says one needs to be open minded and scientifically open minded to study and grow to the question of whether or not Einstein's theory is correct.

In the colonial era, most American women of European descent lived lives much like those of their European counterparts: They were legally and socially subservient to men. Lower and working class women were actually more equal to men of their own classes, but only because they were, like, equally poor. As production shifted from homes to factories, it shifted away from women doing the producing. This led to the so-called “cult of domesticity,” which like most cults, I am opposed to.

In the 5th Century BC Athens was a direct democracy that encouraged wide participation through the principle of ho boulomenos, or anyone who wishes. This meant that any of its approximately 30,000 eligible citizens could attend the ecclesia, a general assembly meeting several times a month. Some ancient philosophers, including Plato, disparaged this form of democracy as being anarchic and run by fools. Could reviving election by lottery lead to more effective government through a more diverse and representative group of legislatures?

If certain amount of output can be produced by given amount of inputs, then the same combination of input puts can also be used to produce less. The key word is feasibility technology. So, if it is feasible to produce half kg of curd from 1 kg of milk, then it is possible to produce 250 grams of curD from 1kg of milk. The second is no free lunch. At least 1 input is required to produce some output, or more than you know more than 1 kind of output. Third is non reversibility, what it means is that a production process cannot be reversed.

The Great Wall began as multiple walls of rammed earth built by individual feudal states during the Chunqiu period to protect against nomadic raiders north of China. Under the Han Dynasty, the wall grew longer still, reaching 3700 miles, and spanning from Dunhuang to the Bohai Sea. The wall was formidable but not invincible. Both Genghis and his son Khublai Khan managed to surmount the wall during the Mongol invasion of the 13th Century. After the Ming dynasty gained control in 1368, they began to refortify and further consolidate the wall using bricks and stones.

And in that coordinate system, the partial differential equation is separable. can figure a better way to do it. This kind of thing is called method of lines. And in certain systems like this, it's a smart thing to do. You need to be kind of lucky that the set up is right, so you can use it. But if you can, it can be pretty good. All right.

The average velocity depends on the time interval t to t plus delta t while the person has displaced a certain amount of vector delta r. So, as a vector, we have delta x over delta t i hat. This component here is what we call the component of the average velocity. And, again as before, this component can be positive, zero, or negative depending on the sine of delta x. And now what we want to do is consider what happens in the limit as delta t becomes smaller and smaller. And that will enable us to introduce our concept of instantaneous velocity.

One thing also I should add that he will be able to rank only if he has finite consumption set and also what we have learned that this will translate into a utility function. So, from here we learned that indifference curve has to be downward sloping.

- Hello? Okay, it's after 12, so I want to get started. So today, lecture eight, we're going to talk about deep learning software. This is a super exciting topic because it changes a lot every year. But also means it's a lot of work to give this lecture. But as usual, a couple administrative notes before we dive into the material. So as a reminder the project proposals for your course projects were due on Tuesday. And again, when working on assignment two, remember to stop your Google Cloud instances. different where we're actually building up this new computational graph, this new fresh thing on every forward pass. That's called a dynamic computational graph. In PyTorch because we're using dynamic graphs, it's super simple. Your code kind of looks exactly like you would expect, exactly what you would do in Numpy. And the code is very clean, easy to work with. Now in TensorFlow the situations is a little bit more complicated because we build the graph once, this control flow operator needs to be an explicit operator. And so we have this tf.cond call which kind of like a Tensor Flow version of if statement, but now it's baked into the Python version.

Part 3 in our series on distributed word representations. We're going to be talking about vector comparison methods. To try to make this discussion pretty intuitive, I'm going to ground things in this running example. On the left, I have a very small vector space model. We have three words, A, B, and C. And you can see graphically that B and C are pretty close together. And A is kind of lonely down here in the corner, the infrequent one.

liyan blake a little bit about him he's kind of out there some of his contemporaries thought he was insane you know nowadays maybe he would be heavily medicated. People think that he's out there and there was that who was William Wordsworth who said that there is something in the madness of this man which interests me more than the sanity of Lord Byron and Walter Scott. He was an individual who you know was into art and was into eventually you know religion and such became a big part of his life but his as an artist he was also big-time into painting.

Summary:
Cú Chulainn, hero of Ulster, stood at the ford at Cooley, ready to face an entire army singlehandedly. The army in question belonged to Queen Meadhbh of Connaught. Enraged at her husband’s possession of a white bull of awesome strength, she had set out to capture the fabled brown bull of Ulster at any cost. Cú Chulpainn invoked the sacred rite of single combat in order to fight the intruders one by one.

The Underworld is actually a lovely place to "live" It boasts historic charm and eccentric neighbors with eternal ties to the area. Tartarus is reserved for a select few who some might call the greatest sinners of all time. Elysium is the Underworld’s exclusive VIP section— and your permanent home. The Underworld also features four other waterways: Acheron, the river of woe; Cocytus, river. of wailing; Lethe, river of oblivion; and Phlegethon, a. great source of natural light.

Summary:
Fluorescence is the emission of light in the absence of heat. Luminescence is the general term. Fluorescence is a little bit more specific. There are different types of luminescence. And you'll get to see some of those varieties of luminecence. The first thing to learn about fluorescence is how to spell it. It is actually fluor-L-L. It's a biological reaction that causes luminescent. And this is a cuttlefish shown here in this image in the corner where they are brightly lit at night.

 RAFAEL JARAMILLO: Today we're going to discuss the many D's of thermodynamics. We'll talk about lowercase d, lowercase Greek d, and uppercase Greek D. He'll draw a 3D visualization of how the entropy for a given phase might vary with pressure and temperature at a fixed composition. Jaramillo: The most common transformations that we talk about are transformations that take place at constant pressure and constant temperature, isobaric and isothermal transformations.

In this video I'm going to be going over lung oscilation specifically the sites of where you osculate. We're going to go over some audio clips of normal breath sounds and where you should hear them at CU that's a big thing. We'll also go over abnormal breath sounds. In the next video I'll be performing an assessment on a patient and show you how to listen with your stethoscope to these sides. I'll also give you some landmarks to make your job easier so you'll know what intercostal space correlates with which lobe of the lung.

Professor Donald Kagan: Sparta is the most important of the early poleis. He says the only decisions made were questions of whether to go to war, whether to make peace. Kagan says when a question was put to the Spartans, they responded by shouting and banging on their shields. The only people who spoke at those assemblies were the kings, the gerousia, or a group of people I haven't mentioned to you yet, the ephors, the five ephor.

Summary:
Professor Steven Smith: I want to talk today about Aristotle's discovery of America. He says Aristotle discovered the American Constitution 1,500 or 2,000 years before it was written. Smith: Aristotle's proposal for a mixture of oligarchy and democracy seems, in many ways, to anticipate James Madison's call for a government where powers must be separated. But Aristotle's mixed constitution differs from ours still in certain important respects, he says. He doesn't so much insist, as you will see in your reading, on the actual separation of functions of government.

Summary:
SNLI is the Stanford Natural Language Inference Corpus-- MultiNLI, and Adversarial NLI. The premises are all image captions from the image Flickr30K data set. All the hypotheses were written by crowdworkers. The overall Fleiss kappa measured interannotator agreement was 0.7, which is a high rate of agreement. It's clear at this point, for example, that ensembles of deep learning methods are the best for this problem, says Christopher Potts.

Summary:
In a perfectly competitive market, the firm is a price-taker. No matter how many units they produce, they're just going to be able to get that same market price. A firm in an imperfectly competitive market will have their own firm-specific demand curve. The price that they get in the market is higher than the marginal cost and the marginal revenue at that point. Folks are willing to pay more than that marginal cost, but you still have no motivation to produce more.

Summary:
Rigidity is really about the lack of motion. In infinitesimal motion, you can think about this in the absence of a motion. You need some smoothness. If there's a way to get started moving, that doesn't actually mean you could actually move. So we're going to need some linear algebra. That's one thing that's useful. So the idea is we think about rigidity-- does a linkage move or not-- to the first order. First order means first derivative.

Summary:
Chess has been known as a tool of military strategy, a metaphor for human affairs, and a benchmark of genius. The game was originally known as chaturanga– a Sanskrit word for "four divisions" With its spread to Sassanid Persia, it acquired its current name and terminology– "chess," derived from "shah," meaning king. Chess-playing computers had been developed for decades, but Deep Blue’s triumph over Garry Kasparov in 1997 was the first time a machine had defeated a sitting champion.

Aryan: I'm gonna go somewhat into detail into what representation learning is and I think this should sort of cap out the last few weeks of deep learning. Aryan: The quiz for this week will probably go live tomorrow but I'm not quite sure yet but you'll try to get it up as soon as possible so I guess like without further Ado let's Jump Right In. I'm Aryan, one of the facilitators for this decal and I'm going to be presenting today's lecture on pre-training with Verona today.

Summary:
The EM algorithm is an unsupervised version of k-means GMM. In GMM, you guess randomly an assignment of every point to the cluster, the probability. You guess where they're probabilistically linked, that is, what's the probability of these points belong to cluster one, this point belongs to cluster two. And then once you have that, you then solve some estimation problem that looks like a traditional supervised learning. The decomposition is quite important. And we're going to try and kind of abstract that away. a bowl-shaped function, right? Now, no matter how I pick the points-- and clearly, I should really only have to worry about picking on the edge. So this is a convex function. This is not convex. And intuitively, the reason I drew these shapes is that convexity for shapes probably makes more intuitive sense, 2D shapes. So we're going to-- we'll actually prove this, I think, why not? Sounds like a fun thing to prove.
