The original UN headquarters complex, located in New York City and constructed between 1949 and 1952, no longer conforms to current safety, fire and building codes. Over the last 50 years there have been no major renovations or upgrades to the buildings or their systems. In September 2005, the headquarters complex was shut down and the staff sent home because a main breaker for electrical power to the top floors of the Secretariat building failed. This failure could have resulted in a major fire. The UN is vulnerable to fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement due to a range of weaknesses in existing oversight.
