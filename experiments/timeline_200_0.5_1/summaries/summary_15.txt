Atas model shows what happens if aggregate demand increases and firms respond to this by saying we want to make more output. As people demand these higher wages shortening our supply curve decreases basically all the way back to essentially where it was before. The price of tuition to Missouri State goes down but my wage is fixed under contract right and so they're gonna have to pay me the Saints of tuition declines and my input prices stay the same that's bad for them and bad for all of the firm's too. it's gonna be trust me I've been doing this for 20 years questions on the AAAS wanna yes so that's what we're going to talk about when we talk about fiscal policy and monetary policy. Changes in taxes and changes in government spending are also pretty obvious right if your taxes go up and the government doesn't give you more goods and services for that you have less stuff. If taxes go down and thegovernment doesn't change the amount of services that they give then you have more money in. your pocket right so you can change people's wealth by changing their taxes or by changing the services that they're getting in exchange. Keynes comes along and says famously and the long run we're all dead in other words yes eventually we'll get back to a but why wait why not go ahead and do something change aggregate demand and get you here to see because there's really no difference between a and seeing anyway other than the number of green pieces of paper it takes to buy the goods and services.
