this constant is 0 for my purposes, or 25 if you prefer. All right. So we'll just keep going on this property next time. And we'll see how from here we can move on to-- the likelihood is actually going to come out of this formula. Thanks. Back to Mail Online home. back to the page you came from.

PhilipPE RIGOLLET: What I want is to have a small bias, hopefully a 0 bias. If this thing is 0, then we see that the estimator is unbiased.

Something that's slightly better is the risk, really the quadratics risk, which is expectation of.
