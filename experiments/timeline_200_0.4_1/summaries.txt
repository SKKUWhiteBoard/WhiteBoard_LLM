John ESSIGMANN: I measure my blood sugar at different times during the day. Gluconeogenesis technically means new synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors. The medicine I take is called Metformin. It has a number of targets, but one of them is one of the enzymes, called PEPCK, Pyruvate Carboxykinase, that's in the gluconeogenic pathway. The liver provides a constant stream of glucose to organs that absolutely require it, like our brain.

Summary:
In this lecture, we introduce and develop the concept of independence between events. If I tell you that a certain event A has occurred, this will generally change the probability of some other event B. In such a case, we say that events A and B are independent. We will then proceed to define the independence of a collection of more than two events. Finally, we will close with an application in reliability analysis and with a nice puzzle that will serve as a word of caution about putting together such a collection. probabilistic models. Probabilism models are models based on a set of assumptions about the future of the economy. The models are based on the assumption that the economy will continue to grow in the future. They can be used to make predictions about future growth.

In today's video i'll show you the importance of de-gassing your bread dough as it's fermenting. No matter how gentle you try to handle your dough you will always de-gas it if only a little bit in today's comparison video we'll make 4 breads they will be made from the same dough but they will all be treated differently. The first one of the four breads will be left alone from the beginning of fermentation until it's baked. The final one will be folded shaped and degassed three times and we won't be fermenting them for the same amount of time. why are you punching it punching is actually quite aggressive and you should never punch your dough the best thing to do is deflate it by pressing it gently as the dough ferments the gas pockets inside the grow larger and larger and the membrane of dough between those pockets can tear. If this process keeps going undisturbed the crumb of the bread can end up with large bubbles surrounded by denser areas of dough this of course not always a bad thing some high hydration breads are specifically made to have that texture.

Of the nearly 11,000 amendments proposed in the centuries since, only 27 have succeeded as of 2016. The founders of the United States were trying to create a unified country from thirteen different colonies. For an amendment to even be proposed, it must receive a two-thirds vote of approval in both houses of Congress. To actually change the Constitution, the amendment must be ratified by three-quarters of all states. The result of such high thresholds is that, today, the American Constitution is quite static.

The chef test highlights the skills that everyone should possess if they want to learn to cook anything at any time and be confident that it'll always come out great. If you already have all seven of these skills and cooking techniques great you can work for me on the other hand if you only have one or two ofthese skills that's still fantastic. every single time because understanding these methods will allow you to make sense out of any recipe or not even use a recipe. Your increased understanding of how different cooking techniques work not what to cook but how the techniques work and then you'll be creating the things that you want you want them to be. Make sure you get a seed at my webinar [Music] and then come back again and again to try and create the things you want to create. You'll be able to create them again andagain and again.

As a nurse you want to be familiar with heart blocks and in this review i'm going to be talking about third degree heart blocks also known as a complete heart block. The reason is occurring is because electrical signal from the atria isn't making it to the ventricles. The person could be born with it so it could be congenital or the person has severe heart disease or they have a myocardial infarction or they're taking some type of medication that they become toxic on like digoxin.

And on Thursday in lecture, we'll discuss the results. What else is left? I think there is a project due next week. There is still a section this week. And I think that homework is all wrapped up, but you would still have a self-assessment of your last homework that will be due next. And then there's a final exam the week after that. be mostly on advanced applications. The idea behind these two lectures is to look at advanced applications, where we have covered a good amount of the material in the ideas behind those applications, but not necessarily everything. We will not quiz you on these application lectures, on the final exam, or anything like that. It's more meant to give you more perspective rather than extra study materials for the final. So far, I've looked at foundational methods for search, for acting adversarial environments, for learning to do new things, and for dealing with uncertainty, noisy information. Let's take a look at some counterparts in real world applications. AlphaGo Zero has no prior knowledge. It starts at a pretty, actually, negative elo rating. Loses all the time initially. It's playing itself, but then gets tested against a set of players. After 21 days, it goes past where AlphaGo Lee Sedol was. And then it was still creeping up after 40 days. Once you reach that level, essentially, there's no further to go, because you solved the game. With reasonable compute power, it traverses the whole tree, even with alpha beta pruning. In 2015, there was the Doppler Robotics Challenge, which was held in Pomona, just east of Los Angeles. The robot had to, essentially, drive a car or walk, but driving the car was recommended. It turned it's very complex to get a robot to do that. The thing is modeling these situations proved even harder than modeling helicopters, because your sensing needs to understand whether or not you're already making contact, and making contact or not. You can be very close, but not have contact. It's a very subtle thing. so many decisions. If they're gigantic, use a lot of power. That's a problem. Let's see what we can do to build smaller networks to make decisions. What else did we not cover yet? Personal robotics. I want to spend a little more than two minutes on that, so let's keep that for Thursday. that's it for today. Bye.

Sir, like if Gucci is a brand and it is. Prices comes down by significant amount. No one could buy a Gucci, it is at that level. Only because of it is prices. I am not certain about this statement then when price of these goods would come down then people would not buy. That is not true. So, these luxury goods are not Giffen goods fine, it is clear? Let me give you just an example typically it is very very difficult to find Giffsen goods.

James was Theos James and Harry this room in I think February of 1689 so those parts were add it afterwards but really I men talks about the earlier crisis. means that is there's no legal framework within which that is within the Constitution for settling the conflict there is no way to do it at law. If there is a conflict of the sort then the people have the right to appeal to Heaven which is a euphemism for for go to war that is Civil War. The power then refs to them and they have theright of resistance I'll come for that the moment now I might mention that in our constitution there are devices that tend to prevent this sort of conflict from happening. changed his mind he thought perhaps it was not all together safe never knew in England the English were regarded in those days as very unstable people.

L's view was that James had just advocated or meod from bacon and the Parliament finding a bacon Throne had simply found an occupant for it and that act did not imply the parliament was Supreme that is a view that they prepered to maintain. Why did L refuse to alter his view I think we have to assume that he didn't change his mind and he persisted in the doctrine that he formed earlier in 79 and 880 I think partly because his views are more radical than the standard view of his college that would be one reason but also because he felt I think that it was inconsistent.

Summary:
David KAISER: Today we're going to be talking about the kind of invention or the hybridization of a whole new subfield within physics that now is often called particle cosmology. It studies the smallest units of matter, the fundamental forces and elementary constituents of matter. It asks about what role they might have in shaping, really, the fate of the entire universe. The field is doing pretty well these days by other measures. Its annual budget just within the United States is on the order of $1 billion a year. This is a $1 billion area of study with devoted colleagues all over the world, not just here in the United States. There are on average two new physics papers, two new preprints posted to the central preprint server archive.org every hour of every day just in this subfield. So it is really a booming, booming subject of study. And I find that all the more astonishing since this field literally didn't even exist 45 years ago. And yet, it's a fairly recent vintage in terms of the kinds of time scales we've been looking at this whole semester. In 1979, two separate theorists working independently of each other suggested that the two fields might be literally the same, not just comparable or considering side by side. So it's not that they're somehow intrinsically different from each other. Instead, their status, instead, is what people assess them on. That's what we'll pick up in the next part of our chat with Dr. Alex Tsiolkovsky, the director of the Centre for Theoretical Physics at the University of Toronto. asymptotic freedom. And actually, it's the reason why our friend and colleague here at MIT, Frank Wilczek, received the Nobel Prize. So this was work introduced by Frank and his then advisor David Gross, and independently by a different very young grad student at the time, David Politzer. And what they found was that the strength of the strong nuclear force, that QCD force that we talked about quite a bit at the end of last class session, that the force actually decreases with the energy scale. for more than half of my life, to his great chagrin. He's won a number of awards, gold prizes and that big award-winning fella. But the award that I take most pleasure in is the fact that he won Boston's Messiest Office. So yes, we'll work on that. Let's see. Fisher says, on the chart of interactions with the field strengths, are those groups? Yes. Fisher, thank you. That's right. So I was avoiding the nomenclature, but you're quite right. a continuous unitary symmetry, which is like saying you could rotate the electron field by any continuum amount, and the equations remain unchanged. The photon only has to mop up a relatively simple symmetry, the U1 gauge symmetry. SU2 was what I was pointing to when I was referring to the weak nuclear force. That's a discrete symmetry structure. SU3, that refers to three different color charges of quantum chromodynamics. And so therefore, the gluons have still a different set of properties, so that's right. does exactly the kinds of things that Smolin and Zee had been doing, trying to unify the Brans-Dicke and Higgs field. And in turn, these new folks, especially people like Mike Turner and Rocky Kolb, went on to become real institution builders in their own right. Not only had they been trained to think carefully at this new interface, they helped really accelerate the trend. So it goes from who even thought of it to who wouldn't even try that? What counts as natural can shift in a pretty short time scale. the hall from Alan's. And by a quirk of the old building 6, we had the same key. A single key would open the whole hallway. Couldn't get rid of it now. And one time, my parents were visiting. And I basically broke into Alan's office. They couldn't believe me when I described what it was like to try to work with this person. So I actually broke into his office to show them the safety violation, fire code violation, horror show that was the den of entropy. So that's a true story. soon, everyone.

Summary:
Judy Hoyt: We're going to discuss the accurate control and placement of active dopant regions through a process called dopant diffusion. The placement of those regions determines many of the so-called short channel characteristics of MOSFETs that we'll talk about. The doping of other materials, not just the silicon itself, but of the polysilicon gate affects things like gate depletion and limits how well the gate voltage controls the channel potential, Hoyt says. The equation numerically, essentially, for an arbitrary doping profile is 1 over the integral of the carrier concentration minus the background concentration. Dopant diffusion is described by Fick's first law, which describes how the flux or the flow of dopant depends upon the doping gradient. When the concentration gradient goes to 0, essentially, the dopant or the atoms are uniformly distributed, say, in the solid, and the flow would stop. Later on, we'll talk about the more atomistic diffusion mechanisms and effects of dopants in the silicon lattice. We're going to consider macroscopic first-- macroscopy models for diffusion. In semiconductor processing, linear scales for dopants are not all that useful. So we often care about how the dopant falls off over many, many orders of magnitude of concentration. In the second case, which is a fixed dose Q, just like we talk about, constant in time. But now we're diffusing near a surface. We can solve it by using, essentially, the prior solution, pretending that the medium is semi-infinite. And the third case is essentially an infinite source of dopant which is made up of small slices. of cases where there are analytic solutions. We talked about the diffusion of a Gaussian profile with a fixed dose. We apply this diffusion to a constant surface concentration. And finally -- we talk about the diffusion of a complementary error function, which we apply for a constant level of surface concentration. The diffusion of this error function can be applied to a fixed level of surface concentration, or a constant level of substance on the surface, for example.

Summary:
Machine learning is about how to acquire a model and acquire the parameters of a model, from data and experience. In the next few lectures, we're going to work through a sequence of different takes on machine learning that are going to highlight different subsets of the big ideas on this topic. We'll see today exactly how data kind of goes through the mill and gets turned into a model. And we'll see more in-depth examples and more structured examples of these kinds of problems later on when we talk about applications. Machine learning can be used to predict labels of new images that are not the ones we've already seen. It's increasingly the case that we feed in low-level features like pixels and higher level features like edges. We'll talk about that in a couple weeks when we talk about narrow nets. There's also tons of applications of machine learning like clustering, or classes, y, inputs called x, outputs are called y, and there's tons of this. The input is the image, the output is the classifications. some account activity and you want to red flag accounts that are suspicious. Automatic essay grading, auto grading, this can be a machine learning problem. Customer service email routing. You'd like to automate the routing of that. Review sentiment. Here's a bunch of reviews of my product. Which ones are good and which ones are bad? Have they gotten better in the past 10 days since the new announcement? And so on. You can do that with classification. You gotta do that before you can do things like translation. In model-based classification, rather than directly learning from errors that you make in the world from experience, think like reinforcement learning model-free. The Naive Bayes assumption is an extremely radical assumption as far as probabilistic models go, but for classification, it turns out to be really effective and it goes something like this. You build a model where the output label and the input features are random variables. There's going to be some connections between them, and maybe some other variables too that might help you build a better model. Machine learning theory is based on trying to say something precise about the connection between what's going on in your data and this future used to which you're going to put the classifier to. The main worry is that in picking the parameters of your model, you do a really good job of capturing that training data, but it doesn't generalize. This is like you download all the exams from past years, and you optimize. You learn all those answers, and then you go to the final exam and it's totally, totally different questions that look nothing like those. You go through an experimentation cycle, it looks something like this. Get your model and learning already, and then you're going to learn the parameters. parameters are things like what's the probability of pixel 73 for the number eight? Then there's hyper-parameters, like, do I want to have features for the lowercased version of the words in case I've seen the word, but never uppercased? Right? These are questions about, is this or this orthis going to work better? You don't want to test your classifiers on the data that was used to train them, because they will do surprisingly well. There can be a slow leak of your test data into your training data if you're not careful. So you try not to peek at the test set, and that's another reason why we have held-out data, which gives you something you can peek at. To see that today, go to CNN.com/soulmatestories and click here. cost-- of different kinds of mistakes may not be the same. And so accuracy isn't always what you want. What you really want, is you want a utility here. You want to know what was my utility, and you should have different costs for these things. There are also cases like machine translation, where you're always going to be a little bit off, a little word here or there, but there's a difference between being completely off and a tiny bit off. And again, we're going talk a lot today and next time about over-fitting and generalization. Spam detection is, in some ways, a very poor example of a canonical classification problem. If you're trying to build a classifier to detect the number 7, the number7 is not like trying to squirm its way out from those pixels to avoid detection, right? You can just get better at the task. And if you get perfect at thetask, great. But you don't want to under-fit either, because then you're going to fail to learn the information that's actually in your training data. In Naive Bayes probabilistic models, over-fitting usually shows up as zeros in your probability table. For other methods, it's actually going to show up in totally other ways. We need to smooth or regularize our estimates, and we could take that polynomial and limit the degree of the polynomials. We already know one kind of over-fits to limit that, so let's just look like what it would look like to just illustrate it. you shrink a hypothesis space, you fit less. Using it too much, you under-fit. So let's take a look at the distribution of a random variable, just to sort of show why we need to do these kinds of things. We can do elicitation, right? You can ask a human. You can go to a doctor and say, hey, I'm building a classifier. What fraction of people with meningitis will present with a fever? And a doctor can give you a guess. You could also do that empirically. The maximum likelihood estimate, or relative frequency estimate, is a way to estimate the likelihood of an outcome. The more samples you draw, the more accurate your estimate will be. But in practice, you need some smoothing to prevent things like zeros in these estimates. This is actually due to a philosopher who kind of worried about things like things like how do I estimate the probability the sun will rise in the morning? Every morning it's risen, so far so far. Every morning the sun's risen. So I need some way of incorporating that into my estimate. example, I can go into my spam, and instead of computing odds ratios on the maximum likelihood-- or empirical relative frequency estimates-- I can instead do some smoothing. And suddenly things that only occurred once, they don't percolate to the top, because they haven't occurred enough to overwhelm that flat prior that I'm associating them with. So this is the top of the odds ratios for ham on the left, and favoring spam on the right. Some of these maybe make sense. Like, there it is. Free is probably in there somewhere. If you see money, that's a good sign that it's spam. In general, your model is going to make errors. The k that's going to be most accurate on my training data is zero. That's the maximum likelihood estimate. We learn our parameters from the training data. We tune them on some different data, like some held-out data, because otherwise, you'll get crazy results. And then eventually, you're going to take the best value, do some final tests, test run. We're talking a bit more about features, because it's important for when we start to get to neural nets. In general, you're going to need more features. In spam classification, we found out that it wasn't enough to just look at words, you've got to look at other sort of metadata from the ecosystem. For digit recognition, you do sort of more advanced things than just looking at pixels, where you look at things like edges and loops and things like that. You can add these as sources of information by just adding variables into your Naive Bayes model, but we'll also talk in the next few classes about ways to add these more flexibly.

The Wall Street Wamboozle, the Financial Fartstorm. And the U.N. Security Council. Crash Course US History hosts explains what caused the Financial Fartstorm that began in late 2008. It was a mixture of public and private activities that tilted towards short-term economic thinking, speculation and irresponsible spending. The event that triggered the chaos was the failure of the investment bank Lehman Brothers in September, just 2 months before the presidential election. The stock market collapsed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping from above 14,000 to around 8,000 which wiped out about $7trillion of shareholder wealth. With it being harder to borrow money, Americans finally cut back on their spending. job to protect you not only by having a standing army but also making you wear your seat belt? Those are ultimately ideological questions, but we have to grapple with them in a real practical way. And the great story of American governance is compromise. But that is also often been the tragedy ofAmerican governance as when the Constitutional Convention compromised over whether African American people were people. So if you’ve learned anything this year, I hope its been that the American story that we find ourselves in now isn’t entirely novel. And I think we have much to learn from those who came before us.

Summary:
Simple graphs are directed graphs where the arrows have a beginning and an end. A directed graph might have a self loop, an edge that starts and begins at the-- starts and ends at the same vertices. A simple graph has a nonempty set, v of vertices, and it has a set E of edges, but the edges now are somewhat different since they don't have beginnings and ends. An edge just has two endpoints that are in V, and we don't distinguish the endpoints. Study: Men have 30% more partners than women, according to the US Department of Health. David Frum: "We're going to come up with a very elementary graph theoretic argument that says that this is complete nonsense" He says there is a fixed relationship between the average number of partners of men, the average degree of the M vertices and the average degrees of the F vertices. Frum says the answer seems to be that people are lying about the number of women and men.

Robotics is a really cool and important direction for the future. I really believe that in the future we will have AI assistance whether they are embodied or not to act as our guardian angels. These agents will help us with cognitive and physical work. With AI we will see such a wide breadth of applications for instance these technologies have the potential to reduce and eliminate car accidents. We have three types of learning and you have seen different aspects of these methodologies throughout the course we have supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. to do given input reinforcement learning is causing a huge revolution in robotics and so um and and why is that. Reinforcement learning is concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take action in an environment in order to maximize the notion of a cumulative reward. In order to get the simulation to drive a real robot we actually need to think about the Dynamics of the robot and so in other words we have to take into account what the vehicle looks like what are its kinematics and its Dynamics and so here is a vehicle that is running the policy learned in simulation. Alexander: We have very effective and Deployable solutions for robot cars that move safely in Easy environments where there aren't many static nor moving obstacles. Many companies and research teams are deploying and developing self-driving cars. Many of these preconditions revolve around certainty in perception planning learning reasoning and execution before we can get to Robo taxi but we can have many other robot solutions that are much that that can happen today. Alexander: We can use deep learning and reinforcement learning to take us from images ofroads onto steering and throttle and what you can do with this is really great. that model to run on edge devices or on huge devices uh you have seen that many of our Solutions are Black Box Solutions and sometimes we have brittle function we have we have easily attackable models. There is so much opportunity for developing improved machine learning using existing models and inventing new models. If we can do this we can create an exciting work world where machines will really Empower us will really augment us and enhance us in our cognitive abilities and in our physical abilities so just imagine waking up enabled by your personal assistant that figures out the optimal time.

HONG LIU: This is a key relation between the bulk and the boundary theories. The more you go to the interior of the space time, then corresponding to the lower energy process when viewed form the field theory. So the duality is that once you realize there's such relation, since the two sides are completely different objects, so the game is that you really have to do lots of guess work. Essentially, you have two sides if you want to relate things on two sides. HONG LIU: We have N equals 4 super Yang-Mills theory. And then here, you have type IIB string in Ads5 times ds5. Here on this side, there is a conformal symmetry which we explained before because this is a four dimensional theory. But being the right hand side, we still have some SO 5, S5. So this is more like a space time symmetry. And the isometry of S5 precisely gives you SO6. And we will not be explicit. You can also map the supersymmetry between them. guesswork is based on some very small clues. Good physicists do is that they can see non-ordinary things from ordinary things. So let me start with that relation. Related to the GS. GS string coupling can be considered as the expectation value of the dilaton field. The bulk field phi due to O has a boundary value phi 0. Any questions about this? Yes? AUDIENCE: Your choice of operator O should be consistent with all symmetries, right? HONG LIU: No. O can be anything. You can choose any O. and the field theory. And that also tells you that if you have a theory which due into a higher dimensional theory, and then that theory has a stress tensor, then this bulk theory must have gravity. So you can say, if any field theory is due to a theory of one higher dimension, that theory must involve gravity-- nothing about quantum gravity. Let's stop here. We're not going to get into quantum gravity right now, we're just going to talk about the theory of gravity.

Bolek Wyslouch: How do you convert a given physical system with all the forces, et cetera, into some sort of fixed form, fixed type of notation? Bolek: We will work on two, again, simple physical systems, one that consists of two pendula driven by forces of gravity, each of them. And we will discuss various interesting-- even though the system is very simple, just two masses, a spring, a little bit of gravity on top of that. could put it with me some spaceship, and go to a place where the gravity is different, right? Why not? So what would happen? So if gravity changes, then basically what will happen is both this term and that term will change. So let's try to see what happens on the Moon. It's a little bit not completely clear what's going on, but you see, actually the motion is kind of a little strange. Look at the red one. The red one is stopping. Then it's going halfway out. It looks kind of messy, doesn't it? center mass of the system or just one of the two --? BOLESLAW WYSLOUCH: This one, I think, this one is justOne of them. Actually, the one-- on the difference-- it normally doesn't matter. What matters this is the frequency and how these move to the other. So let me now talk about this thing, which is called beat phenomenon, because when you look at the motion of one of those objects, or the difference between them or whatever. sort of early on, to instead of, so far, when we talked about pendula, we describe their motion in terms of motion of number 1. It turns out we can rewrite the equation into some sort of new variables, where, so-called normal coordinates, where you'll simultaneously describe both of them and then kind of mix them together to have a new formula. So you do change of variables. So instead of keeping track of x1 and x2 independently, you define something which I called u1, which is simply x1 plus x2, and I define u2,which is x1 minus x2.

We looked at one type of transformation we could utilize for solving systems of equations. Today, we'll look at another one, the eigenvalue decomposition, and on Monday, we will look at the singular value decomposition. Before jumping right in, I want to take a minute and see if there are any questions that I can answer, anything that's been unclear so far. We want to make sure that we're answering those questions in a timely fashion. seen The Price Is Right? This is a game where you drop a chip into a board with pegs in it. It's a model of diffusion. The Plinko chip falls from level to level. It can go left or it can go right with equal probability. So the probability that I'm in a particular cell at level i is this Pi plus one. And there's some sparse matrix A which spreads that probability out. It splits it into my neighbors 50/50. And at the next level it all gets passed down by 50%. For a real N-by-N matrix, there will be eigenvectors and eigenvalues. They're special vectors that are stretched on multiplication by the matrix. The amount of stretch, however, is unique. It's associated with that direction. And that describes the eigenvector-eigenvalue pair. But because there's N equations for N plus 1 unknowns, that means they're not unique. We don't know what an eigen vector is uniquely. We can only prescribe its direction. But we'll find them in a second. triangular form for this matrix. We'll talk next time about the singular value decomposition, which is another sort of transformation one can do when we don't have these complete sets of eigenvectors. You'll get a chance to practice these things on your next two homework assignments, actually. So it'll come up in a couple of different circumstances. I would really encourage you to try to solve some of these example problems that were in here. Solving by hand can be useful.

Summary:
A random variable is a number that's produced by a random process. In physics, the number of alpha particles detected by a Geiger counter in a second is believed to be a random number. The number of faulty pixels in a monitor is also produced from an unpredictable randomness in the manufacturing process. The only time that C is not greater than or equal to 1 is when you have all tails, so there's a 7/8 chance, 7 out of 8 outcomes involve 1 or more heads. A random variable is not a variable, it's a function that maps the sample space to the real numbers. Usually this would be a real valued random variable. We have another concept of independence that holds for random variables that was motivated by the definition of independence for events. If I have an event A, I can package A into a random variable, just like the match random variable was really packaging the event that the coins matched into a [? 0-1 ?] valued variable. And it means everything that matters about event A is captured by the random variable IA. this can have value 0 and 1. If R is independent of S then R is really independent of any information at all that you have about S. If I have k random-- if I have a bunch of random variables, a large number much more than k, they're k-way independent if every set of k of them are mutually independent. And of course as with events we use the 2-way case to call them pairwise independent. We'll be making use of it in an application later when we look at sampling and the law of large numbers.

The Knight tells GNE you have a year to find me you can find me I the Knight of the green Chapel green Chapel no kidding Everything Green line 232 233 come or be called a coward. The Knight came here specifically to challenge the best that Earth has ever bred is what he was saying and so this is the moment and now GNE has a year and a day to think about his impending doom is he going to go do we think he's going to take the axe shot is this all a test is he Going to trick something I mean these are all thoughts that should be going through your mind. you receive the the hunter the owner of the house the husband says whatever you receive you must give to me that seems kind of weird what possibly could he receive while he's there well we find out that the wife really kind of starts to come on to him over time okay real flirty she's she's a temptress okay very seductive uh she gives him a kiss what does he do when the husband comes home that day cuz the husband's going to share his his food share his everything with him as long as GNE you share with me. you know of his pact uh with King Arthur to be a good individual um she eventually does give him a green girdle um a green corset a a sash some sort of clothing that he can wear under his stuff and she gives that to him and he accepts it okay which isn't necessarily so bad because she says you wear this and no harm will fall upon you that's about the best thing you can say to somebody who's getting ready to go get hit in the head with an axe. So he breaks his word okay he becomes a coward and so he does leave and he keeps that GLE for himself. Justin: The Green Knight is a coward and you were just proved to be a coward. The Knight knows about the girdle and so he knows all about the wife giving that to the Green Knight. Justin: If he never violated his oath the most he was ever going to do was scare him and probably wasn't even going to hurt him. He says do it again I will not flinch go on game on 185 187 excuse me um I shall stand your stroke not starting at all till your axe has hit me.

Summary:
Grenade algorithm uses a minimal set of three-point correspondences to solve the camera pose estimation problem in the grenade formulation. The disadvantage of this particular formulation is that it ends up with a four degree polynomial which means that it could give up to a total of four possible solutions. The question becomes whether can we find the solution directly from any four point correspondences such that the solution is unique? The answer is yes and it was formulated by quan at all in a paper that was published in the 1990s. s1 we know that t5 here is actually a vector that is made up of the same entry but of different order so x4 x3 x2 x and 1 of different entry. We know that by observation any two elements the product of tij is going to be equal to tk and tl for this constraint to be valid where i plus j must equal to k plus l. We can substitute the respective components of t5 into this particular constraint to get this equation over here. where we can solve for since we know that x equals to s1 squared we can solved for the final depth by taking the square root of x. Once s1 is solved we can back substitute s1 into the polynomial equation of f i j s i and s j equals to zero. Once f sj is solved, we can then back substitute it into another equation with sj and solve for the other unknown depth. Finally we will get all the depth after we have gotten all the unknown depths we can do the same thing to to apply absolute orientation to recover the camera pose as in the grenade algorithm. equation we can stack them all up so one two all the way to six equations and we end up with a coefficient matrix with an a matrix of of dimension 6 by 5. in order for non-trivial solution to exist then this guy here better be of a maximum of rank four so what we can do here is that we can take the svd of a and this will give us u sigma v transpose where we simply the vector that corresponds to the least singular value in sigma.

In this video, we're going to compute some useful quantities for the exponential random variable. The CDF of x is the probability that X is less than or equal to little x. We use the standard formula, which is minus infinity to infinity t times fx of t dt. For this, if you evaluate the balance, 0 makes this 0, and 0 to get 1 over. And so the expectation is 1 over lambda, and so the variance is part c, so OK, so far so good.

Summary:
Professor: Can you explain the physical significance of the crystal momentum? Professor: The information about the momentum can be encoded in these spatial variation of the phase of the wave function. Professor: A central property from the Schrodinger equation is at the time variation d dt of p is equal to the expectation value of minus d the potential of x d x. The momentum expectation value is time independent, so it can be written in the form of e cubed, equal to e to the minus i upon h bar p l. Glossing over in the entire story here. Which of the following. So, is u of x a real function? Well, so when we started out asking what are the eigenfunctions of the transit by l operator, all we showed was that, and I'm going to do this on a separate board just to make it clearer. Tell me if this turns off, because it kept bumping. OK. So we've determined is that if we take q l is equal to alpha, then Phi sub q if eigenvalue label by its eigen value, q, can be written in the form e to the i q x u sub q of x. This diagram is telling you is which e's are allowed. If you put on a capacitor, played across your perfect lattice, you don't get any current. So the particle, the charged particle in your lattice just oscillates back and forth in a block oscillation. And that is manifestly what happens with copper. But the experimentalist comes back to you and says look dude. That is a ridiculous model because the copper isn't in fact perfect, it's messy. So how do you test the model? Well there are two ways to test the situation. One is you improve the model to incorporate properties that copper actually has. And see if you can actually get the same conductivity. Physicists can build a system that has exactly a periodic potential. They can do it with lattices not of atoms, but lattices of dielectric. This has been proved in a very small number of real honest quantum mechanical systems. The question is really a question of quantum computation, which we'll come to next week. But, the basic question is how robust is this answer is? And the answer is robust at all, because it has enough impurity that it conducts everything in the real world. In one dimension, the crystal structure, the shape of the lattice, is going to determine it. Different atoms are different wells, so they'll give you different band structure. Different materials for example, diamond versus copper, are going to give. you different bands allowed energies, because the potential is different. It has different shape. And so when you solve the problem for the energy eigenvalues is a function of now the three different components of the crystal momentum, you'll just get a different set of equations. Photonic crystals are periodic arrays of dielectrics. They have bands of allowed energy and gaps of disallowed energies where no waves propagate through. The structure of a photonic crystal on the surface of a butterfly wing makes it shiny and blue. It looks like it's a crystal reflecting in a specific frequency. At some sharp blue. And the reason is, it is exactly this form. If you look at it under a microscope, you see little rays of protein which have different dielectric than air. and metallic without actually being shiny and metallic. And it's not a pigment, so it doesn't absorb light and decay over time. It's like the best thing you could ever do if you wanted to be a shiny, fluttery, flying thing. OK. So that's it for band gaps. And I want to move on to the remainder, the last topic of our course. Which is going to be entanglement and quantum computation. And here I need to give you one quick observation. The probability of finding the particle at point A is given by chi a squared. This is normalized, so when we integrate against it, we get 1. And similarly, the probability that we find the second particle at b is this thing norm squared. But we also studied the symmetric configuration, which was equal to 1 over root phi, root 2. Chi of a. Phi of b. Symmetric, plus chi of b phi of a, right? And this tells us something totally awesome. Einstein created a thought experiment which we're going to study in detail next week called the EPR experiment. He left Germany in 1932 December, about three weeks before Hitler took power. And he did so with decisiveness and dispatch and a head of almost all of his. German-Jewish physicist colleagues and those German physicists for whom the Hitler regime was unacceptable. The three of them talk about it. They write the paper and they put it out. And I want to share with you, actually, a really lovely description of the way the problem was represented in a way by a book that I recommend to all of you.

How does one come up with such an expression? OK, OK, I'm sorry. The attention layer is basically modeling the interactions between the query and context. The query-to-context attention is trying to measure the importance of these context words with respect to some question words. The final output layers are basically just two classifiers just trying to predict the start and end positions. And the whole BiDAF model can be just trained in an online training set, in terms of the log likelihood of the gold answer and the end position of the answer. It's basically taking the product of these two probabilities, but it is the sum of the two negative probabilities. BERT is a deep bidirectional transformer encoder pre-trained on large amounts of text. It is trained on the two training objectives, including masked language modeling and the next sentence prediction. The BERTbase has 110 million parameters and the BERT-large model has 330 million parameters. If you just take this BERT model, and by just optimizing all the parameters together, it can give you a very high performance. And even if you use a stronger pre-training models, they can even lead to better performance on SQuAD. Today, because she doesn't have a Stanford login, we're going to do questions inside Zoom. So if you'd like to ask a question, if you use the raise hand button, we can promote you. And if you hang around and don't leave the Zoom for more than a few minutes, maybe we'll just promote everybody who's still there into people in the regular Zoom for some bits of discussion. There are now four people who've been promoted. OK. Should I read those questions? Should I look at the chat or? No. Most existing question answering datasets or reading comprehension datasets have been collected from Mechanical Turk. So it is very difficult to avoid some kind of artifact though, like a simple clues or superficial clues-- let's say not superficial but some simple clues that are for the machines to pick up. So that's the reason that more specialized models that have been trained very well in one data set, it's very hard to generalize this kind of thing to another data set. So if you do the remnant questions in your train, dev, and test set, there's a debate of just debate of it's inevitable that it's going to overlap. The goal of this project is trying to ingest all the phrases in the Wikipedia. So these conversations are built using the training set of the question answering datasets. By using end to end, we apply this encoder to all the phrase, like 60 billion phrases in this region. So the model is definitely able to generalize from theTraining set to all of the Wikipedia phrases. And then we can use text as the representation, can actually generalize well for the unseen questions. It doesn't have to have seen the phrase then. Is this what you were asking? I see, OK. Next question is about the future of NLP. Do you think that in order to solve NLP in the sense that you can perform on par with humans on all NLP tasks it's sufficient to only interact with text data? Or do you think we'll eventually need the sort of experiences and common sense that. you get only from seeing and viewing the world and having a set of interactions that we as humans have? Yeah. I mean, common sense is a very difficult-- even in the context question answering. So all these things need to be resolved. encountered this paper called Learnable Quantizers, which essentially learns baseless representation for the quantizers jointly with the leads of the network. And while this would be extremely effective if you were to just like, say, train from scratch, I was just sort of curious, do you think there is some way to do this say a pre-trained BERT model or something like that? I had a few ideas with like beam search for instance, but I don't see a very clear way of doing that. Next question is from Danqi, who was one of the co-organizers of the EfficientQA task. Danqi: How concerned should we be about potential biases into these record labels or how we evaluate them, or is that just more of a concern for more open ended questions? Yeah, this is definitely very important. I mean, we will have more discussion of toxicity and bias coming up very soon, including actually Thursday's lecture as well as a later lecture, not specifically about QA though.

Summary:
 homework two is out now. This weekend sessions will be having some more background on deep learning. We're also gonna be reaching, uh, releasing by the end of tomorrow, what the default projects will be for this class. Um, and those proposals will be due, um, very soon, er, in a little over a week. The assignments, [inaudible] are they limited to TensorFlow? asked the question if, if the assignment is limited toTensorFlow. I'm pretty sure that everything relies that you're using Tensor Flow. Last week, we were discussing value function approximation. Today we're gonna start to talk about other forms of value function approximations using deep neural networks. We're mostly not gonna talk so much about enormous action spaces, but we are gonna think a lot about really large state spaces. And so, this could be things like a laser range finder for our robot, which told us how far away the walls were in all 180 degree directions. And the key thing was that we don't know what the true value of a policy is. So, the two ways we talked about last time was inspired by the same. There are some limitations to use the linear value function approximation, even though this has been probably the most well-studied. One alternative that we didn't talk so much about last time is to use sort of a really, really rich function approximator class. Some of those are Kernel based approaches. If you take a machine learning you've heard of k-nearest neighbors, those are sort of these non-parametric approaches, where your representation size tends to grow with the number of data points. Deep neural networks can be useful but they generally don't scale so well. What we're talking about today is thinking about deep neural networks which also have very flexible representations but we hope we're gonna scale a lot better. These are- happen a lot in unsupervised learning like predicting whether or not something is a cat or not or, you know, an image, uh, of a particular object, um, or for regression. So, we're just gonna think of com- making a function approximator which is a composition of a number of functions. how we could use these type of approximations for Atari. And then we had the results that were kind of happening around like 1995 to maybe like 1998, which said that, "Function approximation plus offline off policy control, plus bootstrapping can be bad, can fail to converge." So I think for a long time after that, the, the community was sort of backed away from Deep Neural Networks for a while. And so, perhaps it was natural that, like, around in like 2014, DeepMind and DeepMind combined them and had some really amazing successes with Atari. are the important things that they, um, did in their paper, this is a nature paper from 2015, is they use the same architecture and hyperparameters across all games. Now just to be clear, they're gonna then learn different Q functions and different policies for each game. But their point was that they didn't have to use totally different architectures, do totally different hyperparameter tuning for every single game separately. It really was the sort of general architecture and setup was sufficient for them to be able to learn to make good decisions for all of the games. DQN, deep Q-learning addresses these is by experienced replay and fixed Q-targets. Experienced replay, prime number if you guys have heard about this, if you learned about DQN before is we're just gonna stroll data. So, even though we're treating the target as a scalar, the weights will get updated the next round which means our target value changes. So this is nice because basically it means that you reuse your data instead of just using each data point once, you can reuse it and that can be helpful. Learn to model, a dynamics model and a word model, and then the planning for that which is pretty cool. But we don't wanna do that all the time because there's a computation trade-off and particularly here because we're in games. Um, I'm trying to strike the right balance between continuing experience like new data points versus re-flagging it. Can we use something similar to like random probability just decide to re-flag [inaudible]. The question is about how would we choose between getting new data and how much to replay. This is just reducing the noise and the target that we're trying to sort of, um, if you think of this as a supervised learning problem, we have an input x and output y. The challenge in RL is that our y is changing. If you make it that you're- so your y is not changing, it's much easier to fit. This is really just about stability and that's- that's true for the experience replay too. Experience replay is just kinda propagate information more- more effectively and this is just gonna make it more stable. Lemme just to clarify, if we set alpha to zero, what's the rule for selecting tuples among the existing tuples? It's a great question. Lemme just clarify. If you are fixing, um, uh, your w minus, then, if you were looking at our case that we had before, then you wouldn't be able to continue propagating that back, because you hadn't update yet, yet, that's exactly right. So there's gonna be this tension between, when you fix things versus her propagating information back. It's very computationally, expensive or impossible in some cases to figure out. It could be super tempting to try to start, by like implementing Q learning directly on the ATARI. Highly encourage you to first go through, sort of the order of the assignment and like, do the linear case, make sure your Q learning is totally working. Even with the smaller games, like Pong which we're working on, um, it is enormously time consuming. It's way better to make sure that you know your Q Learning method is working, before you wait, 12 hours to see. whether or not, oh it didn't learn anything on Pogge. So, that, that- there's a reason for why we, sort of build up, the way we do in the assignment. Um, another practical, to a few other practical tips, feel free to, to look at those, um, and then we were on Thursday. Thanks. Back to Mail Online home.back to the page you came from.

In this section, we're going to talk about the relativistic Doppler effect. We make good use of our space-time diagrams, which we discussed earlier. The question is how is this being observed by an observer which is moving with a relative velocity v with respect to the source? So we have to apply Lorentz transformation. And we find then-- this is a little bit of an algebra exercise here-- that the period now is given by 1 plus beta over 1 minus beta square root of that times tau.

in this video we're going to discuss what externalities are in economics. An externality is when you do something that affects the well-being or the good of another person or a company but you're neither harmed or rewarded for what you did to that person so the externalities can be positive they can be negative. A negative exTERNality is where you've harmed someone you've done something to somehow impose a cost on someone or some some company or something and you haven't reimbursed that person. where you have a negative externality like pollution or something like that it would be overs supplied relative to what is socially efficient or optimal. Where you have an over-supply of something like pollution, for example, you would have it over supplied in a way that would be socially efficient and optimal. For example, if you have pollution, it would have to be over supplied to avoid it becoming a problem. This would be a way to reduce the amount of pollution or other negative externalities in the environment.

Political philosophy is the oldest of the social sciences. It can boast a wealth of heavy hitters from Plato and Aristotle to Machiavelli, Hobbes, Hegel, Tocqueville, Nietzsche. The study of the great books or great thinkers of the past can easily degenerate into a kind of antiquarianism, into a sort of pedantry, says Professor Steven Smith. But these works provide us with the most basic questions that continue to guide our field, he says. "The ideas of John Maynard Keynes, both economists and political philosophers, when they are right, are more powerful than is commonly understood," says Smith. see you back, and have a very good but thoughtful September 11^(th).

Ahern: I have never had an exam where I had fewer questions. There were maybe 10 questions I got on the exam and that was for a class of this side, really unusual. I find most students are honest. I've only had a handful of situations where in this class, where I've had dishonesty as an issue. The only students I've ever had with serious dishonesty issues actually were in smaller classes interestingly enough. But it has happened here and I do have taped evidence when it does happen. Ahern: How many zwitterions, how many amino acids can form zwittersion? None. They all can. That's not trick. You guys should know that, right? Is the answer "None" a trick? I'm sorry, I don't think so, folks. There are no amino acids, everything, so think about it. Ahern: What did you have in mind for the last question? The one about the Kcat. How can you have two apparent Kcats? It depends on how you calculate the concentration of the enzyme. where time is sometimes a factor, and so I was going to have 3 of the longer answer questions and I decided not to do that and I made them shorter. There's trade offs in all these as I've told other classes. Next term, the format of the exam changes in 451. Most people like 451 better because the maximum number of points on a question I think is 3. If you're going to spend a fair amount of time on something, it should be worth more points. Anybody hate the exam? You can say it. S1 proteases are a class of enzymes that are called serine proteases. They all have serine, histidine, and aspartic acid as a catalytic triad at the active site. It's very easy to alter the genetic code for any of these proteases and change which amino acid is presence at any given place. When they do that, and they compare the activity, so this is the log of Kcat. The wild type enzyme has an activity up here. One 10 millionth as active when that serine is changed to an alanine. of a sudden realizes, "Whoa! What's that?" He grabs it, you know. Wipes the dust off of it. Of course in the process polishes this thing. And out pops this magic genie. And he says, "oh master, thank you, I will grant you 3 wishes." and the guy says, 'oh, this is really great' he says,. "I guess I want a billion dollars "so that I can be a very rich man." and poof, a certificate appears in his hands and it says he has a billion. dollars in a Swiss bank account. Carbonic anhydrase can catalyze the conversion of a million molecules of substrate into product per second. Most enzymes have a fairly narrow pH range where they work that's ideal. At pH 9, the enzyme is far more active than it is at pH 7, indicating that a very, very important step is the removal of that proton. The rate of formation of the nucleophile is the critical step in the catalytic action of this enzyme like that of the proteases that you saw before. like we saw with the peptide bond and everybody's happy. I will very briefly go over that next time and I will see you on Friday. Thank you for listening to our show on CNN.com. We will be back on Friday at 10 a.m. ET for a new episode of CNN Live in the U.S. and 2 p.M. ET in the UK. For more, visit CNN.co.uk/live and follow us on Twitter @cnnlive and @CNNLive.

Summary:
RAFAEL JARAMILLO: Let's talk about intermediate phases and line compounds. He recalls intermediate phase in a three-phase system. He says the solution model becomes very narrowly shaped, like a pin. All possible common tangents are going to converge at the same point, he says. "I no longer need a solution model. I only need one point," Jaramillo says. 'I can't help myself. I got to draw the mouse-face plot' Magnesium nickel system has a number of different phases. At high temperature, this Laves phase develops some width. But when you drop down to low temperature, both of these intermediate phases appear as line compounds. These are very distinct structures, and they're only occurring at very distinct compositions. That's a hallmark of an intermediate phase. That is a line compound. Let's talk about the size of these vertical segments. And it's often written as delta form. So what is the compound formation energy? It is the free energy change for formation of 1 mole. of compound from the elements in their reference states. So, for example, I might have 2 moles of magnesium in. its alpha phase plus alpha-- let's say HTP-- plus a mole of nickel in its alpha FCC. phase. And these can react to form magnesium 2 nickel. And there's a normalization that you need to apply in order to use formation free energies in free-energy composition diagrams. So that is kind of a algebraically-simple point, but it's a conceptual point that it's easy to mess up. There's an infinity of examples of line compounds. Silicon tends to be a pretty useful additive for copper-based alloys. Doping semiconductors is why we're able to talk to each other over there. Without doping, there is no semiconductor devices, and no electronics revolution. So the fact that you can dope some metals into silicon is as important as the solubility limits can be in the parts per billion. It's a very famous line compound, so on the last P set, you're going to do some problems. Silicon carbide is a refractory-- some people will say it's a ceramic. Some people say no because it doesn't contain oxygen. It's of enormous industrial importance. It also is an emerging semiconductor material for high-power electronics. In 50 years from now, if the idea of a power substation is a thing of the past, it will be due to silicon carbide and similar high- power electronics that are being developed today, says Rafael JARAMILLO. The final thought of the lecture is the case of metal oxides, which are line compounds. What is the main component of a rock that you know? What's the main part of the rock that's reacting to form Mz2 OO2? What do I determine? Does anyone know some oxides? What is a common component of rock that is reacting to Mz 2 O2? Do you know any oxides that are reacting with Mz 1 O2 to form an oxygen-rich gas?

Summary:
A random variable can take different numerical values depending on the outcome of the experiment. Some of the possible numerical values of a random variable will be more likely than others. We will describe these relative likelihoods in terms of the so-called probability mass function, or PMF. The PMF is also sometimes called the probability law or the probability distribution of a discrete random variable. We use a subscript, X, to indicate which random variable we're talking about. And it has a probability. And in our case this probability is equal to 1/2. the form of the answers. And it's always convenient to also provide a plot with the answers that we have. The answers come in the form of a plot. The plot comes in the shape of a map. The map is a map of the world as seen from the top of a mountain. The top of the mountain is a mountain with a waterfall at the top. The waterfall is a waterfall as well as a river. The river is a river that runs through the middle of the village. The rivers run through the village and the valley.

Summary:
Protein three-dimensional structure and its implications for the binding of small molecules such as drugs. How can we use these basic motifs to recognize other macromolecules, other proteins and nucleic acids? We have these motifs that we could find, weight matrices for them by aligning lots of sequences. Now instead of aligning sequences, let's see what we can do by mutating both the protein part and the nucleic acid part. And then we know from the three dimensional structure that it interacts mainly with the middle nucleotides. minus 9th seconds. That's atomic motion. Transcription that we talked about, all of the regulatory mechanisms of transcription last time, the rate of the constant for that process is around 50 nucleotides per second. Not entirely coincidentally, that's about the rate at which it is translated into protein. That could be used as a timer in a circuit of these longer time frames, like cell cycle, circadian rhythm, very long time frames in ecological systems with bamboo and various pests. then development and aging, which can be on the order of hundreds of years, at least for humans, turtles, and whales. So what we think proteins are good for depends on the accuracy. And the accuracy depends upon the method. As you get to 1 Angstrom or better in your accuracy, as you can get from NMR and X-ray crystallography, you now are in a position to study catalytic mechanism and design and improve ligands, such as drugs. There may be a day where we can do this all from ab initio prediction or modeling at very great distances. HIV is one of the most sequenced molecules on Earth. The HIV gene encoding the reverse transcriptase polymerase. It's been sequenced many times because as a patient takes the drugs, their population of the AIDS virus changes. And that causes a drug resistance in the HIV, with unfortunate consequences for the patient. We can take-- now, making mutations in polymerases is not entirely of negative consequences. And I'm going to show you a really beautiful example where a DNA polymerase, you want to change it so that it can now handle what would normally be an inhibitor. The way we program in general proteins is either transgenics, where we might overproduce the protein, or homologous recombination, which is the ultimate where we go in and if the protein is already present. Another way is by modulating the activity of the proteins from the outside with drugs or drug-like molecules and chemical kinetics. In the case of the zinc finger, we made an altered specificity. We made new zinc fingers with bind to completely new trinucleotides. By changing one amino acid, we could make it now accept almost four logs better. The topic for the next few slides is how do we create chemical diversity? And I'm going to introduce this, the idea of chemical diversity, in a way I hope nicely connects to where we've been with RNA arrays. RNA arrays, and the double-stranded RNA array that we used earlier in class today, can be generated in a commentorial sense. You can think of it as an ultimate and flexible array, and you can move the beads around and put them in new arrays. And we'll talk about opportunities for making these analogs. on a solid phase, shown by these little hexagons on the far right side of the slide. And you add-- you remove the protecting group on the immobilized polymer, one protecting group. And then you bring in this reactive group, otherwise protected. And there's really one major product that you expect. You wash off all of the excess. You now have one longer. You deprotect. This DMT group is removed. There may be additional steps, such as oxidation, which will stabilize the new bond. I said there's an opportunity here for modifying the nucleotides or oligopeptides or other chemicals to make them so that they're related to, but not identical in every property, to normal constituents of your body or of a bacterial cell. And why would you want to make derivatives? Why not make the exact thing? And examples are, in the previous slide, you can make modified bases. And in slide 29 here you can change the backbone itself. And there are analogous processes to generate chemical diversity on smaller molecules.

A lot of these Technologies were innovated five ten years ago but you and I don't see them in our daily lives so what is what's the Gap here between Innovation and deployment. We'll talk about how Themis is innovating in these areas in order to bring new algorithms in this space to Industries around the world after we talk about the ramifications for this for real world AI. Commercial facial detection systems are everywhere you actually played around with some of them in lab two when you trained your vae on a facial detection data set. The biases in these models were only uncovered once an independent study actually constructed a data set that is specifically designed to uncover these sorts of biases by balancing across race and gender. There are other ways that data sets can be biased that we haven't yet talked about so so far we've assumed a pretty key assumption in our data set which is that the number of faces in ourData is the exact same as theNumber of non-faces in our Data set. lecture so so far we've been focusing mainly on facial recognition systems and a couple of other systems as canonical examples of bias however bias is actually far more widespread in machine learning. Consider the example of autonomous driving many data sets are comprised mainly of cars driving down straight and sunny roads in really good weather conditions with very high visibility. In some specific cases you're going to face adverse weather bad um bad visibility near Collision scenarios and these are actually the samples that are the most important for the model to learn. Uncertainty or when a model does not know the answer is the core idea behind uncertainty estimation. In the real world uncertainty estimation is useful for scenarios like this this is an example of a Tesla car driving behind a horse-drawn buggy which are very common in some parts of the United States. The exact same problem that resulted in that video has also resulted in numerous autonomous car crashes. There are multiple different types of uncertainty in neural networks which may cause incidents like the ones that we just saw. compete in the competition which the details are described in the lab but basically it's about analyzing this data set creating risk-aware models that mitigate bias and uncertainty in the specific training pipeline. At Themis our goal is to design advance and deploy a trustworthy AI across Industries and around the world.

Summary:
HONG LIU: So if you want to compute, say, some scattering amplitude from alpha to beta-- so alpha's some initial state and beta's some final state. Say alpha consists of momentum p1 and PN-- or pm, and beta, say momentum p m plus 1 and pn. And then you can get this scattering amplitude just by taking your momentum-space correlation function, OK, for the n points. So this is obtained by doing a Fourier transform. So any questions on this? Yes? AUDIENCE: So can you explain again why this diagram, like, you have one branch and then there's a loop? the meaning of all these different solutions for alpha and beta or for gammas, OK? So as I mentioned, you can have infinite number of solutions. What's the meaning of them? So first, let's imagine when we look at this equation, so in this matrix equation, then you have this psi which is a four- component vector. So imagine, just say, consider making a basis change in psi. OK, so a basischange in psi just means, in linear algebra, this is a vector. to show, OK, so now we want to show that the Dirac equation has the same property, OK. OK, that's much more nontrivial. Again, it's really ingenious, ingenious, yeah, but we see, actually, it works.OK, so we will do it next time. Next time, we will show you how to do the same thing in a different way. We will do that in a few minutes. We are going to take a break. We're going to have a drink.

The U.S. Supreme Court is the highest federal court in the United States. The job is for life, barring resignation, retirement, or removal from the court by impeachment. So far, six justices have been foreign-born, at least one never graduated from high school, and another was only 32 years old when he joined the bench. Most presidents nominate individuals who broadly share their ideological view, so a president with a liberal ideology will tend to appoint liberals to the court. Of the 112 justices who have held the position, not one has yet been removed from office.

Jake Xia: This is the second time we are having this class. The purpose of this course is really to give you a sampling menu to see how mathematics is applied in modern finance. We will be doing a bit more polling along the way, mainly to get feedback of how you feel about the class. And so hopefully, this will give you enough information to decide this is a field you would like to pursue in your future career. The class will be held every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon from 2:30 to 4:00. "VaR" concept is also, obviously, a very important concept. And we talk about the volatility exposure was vega. And on top of that, what are the tail risks? What are the events that can actually get you into big trouble? So people use value at risk. Then capital. How much capital are you using? It becomes a veryimportant issue nowadays. And balance sheet. You have asset, you have liability. How do you leverage? How much leverage you have? Before the crisis, for example, lot of the banks leverage up 40 times. Vasily Kuznetsov: Arbitrage is really to find the relationships between prices, and try to profit from those relationship mispricing. He says the systematic trader builds computer models. Kuznets: Math is very useful in risk management, which I will give you some quiz -- questions -- to test your knowledge of the market. He adds that math plays a very important role to quantify how much exposure you have to the risks you have in your bank account or in the stock market. facing two choices, choice A and a choice B. Choice A being you have 80 chance to lose $500. You have 20% chance to win $500, right? That's choice A. Or choice B, you basically just lock in you have 100% chance of losing $280. Let me ask you, for whoever likes to choose choice A, please raise your hand. One, two, three, four. About six out of say, let's call it 50. So, that's really the common behavior, which mathematically may not make sense. your bank account balance is-- let's say you are a freshman student. Your choice will be very different from someone who has $100,000 in his bank account. And also, your risk tolerance, how much you can tolerate. So learn the math, learn the finance first, but keep those questions along the way when you are learning during this class. So suggested homework, optional. Go to the course website, read what we have put up for the financial glossary. So if you still have things you don't understand, compile your own list of financial concepts. We still have about 15 minutes or 12 minutes left, so I'll pass it to Vasily, then maybe we can leave five minutes for some questions. VASILY STRELA: [INAUDIBLE] mentioned that, Apple trades, that now it's $494.4 Yeah, just a couple of [inaUDIBLE]. Well, first of all, no offense to people who were [INAudIBLE], but I just wanted to give an example of [INA UDIBLE]. optimal size, that would be your numerical derivative of this blue function. While if you use an optimal shift size, which [INAUDIBLE] computed, it would be much smoother and much better. So, that's one of example, and that's what he did. And we actually are implementing it in our systems and plan to use it in practice. Another project was actually quite different. And it was about electronic trading and basically how to better predict prices of currencies and exchange rate. We put syllabus there, a short list of literature. We will be posting a lot of materials there. Probably most lectures will be published there. Jake's slides are there already. So, any questions? We like to get your emails so we can put you on the website for further announcements. But it's probably easier if you put your email on the sign up sheet, so that we can [INAUDIBLE]. VASILY STRELA: Yeah, but please visit and sign up here, because there will be announcements to the class.

Adam Martin: How do you go from something you're interested in learning about an organism to actually identifying genes and mechanisms that are important for that? Martin: The two heroes of today's lecture will be the roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans, and the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. He also highlights a couple important vertebrate-model organisms-- the zebrafish and the mouse. Martin: Most of them are fairly small, and they're easy to house large numbers of them in a lab. Adam Martin: circadian rhythm is a behavior. We are awake during certain parts of the day and are asleep at night. If you're hidden from the light-dark cycle, you continue this cycle for some amount of time. Martin: There's something intrinsic in our system such that we want to exist on this 24-hour wake-sleep cycle. He says the Nobel Prize-winning researchers identified a gene called "period" that is associated with familial advanced-phase syndrome, which is a sleep disorder.

Summary:
The size of the ribosome is similar to the size of a rhinovirus. The mature transcript is resistant to exonucleases. The poly-adenine tail of the transcript is structural to protect the ends of that transcript. The transfer RNAs and theribosomes are the molecular players in translation. They play a key role in translation and give you much more proteins than one gene can encode, which is a wonderful way to diversify transcripts and give them different functions. The genetic code, which forms the basis of this entire concept, has some features to it where it does have some degeneracy. But we'll go through the degeneracy, and we'll take a look at the genetic code because it will tell us exactly how the three letter-- the words made of three bases encode everything we need for translation. The ribosomes were discovered a decade later, and that was the work that was awarded a Nobel Prize for. And then, later on, things started to get to the point where you know, these are sort of things you want to get out to. The genetic code gives you the identities of what are known as the codons, which is how we designate the triplet of nucleotides. The way you read this table is you read the first letter. So, if I'm going here, here, it's going to be starting UU. And then, within each block, there are the four alternatives for the other four bases. The third one, basically, just designates those. It is the absolute-- the sort of Rosetta Stone for translating messenger RNA to amino acid sequence using codons. "I think this field is fascinating. Once you get used to the mechanics of it, it's really cool to think of how you go from DNA to RNA to folded proteins," he says. "Don't forget my office hours on Monday if you need them," he adds. "I'll be in the lab all day, every day, if you want to talk to me about it." "I've got a lot of questions for you," she says, "but I'll be happy to answer them."

Summary:
Professor Donald Kagan: We are living in the early years of a polis sometime in the eighth century B.C. The date that's typical for the general phenomenon of colonization coming out of the mother cities of Greece is 750 roughly. The earliest date according to Greek tradition, if my memory is correct, was something like 773 where the Greeks date the foundation of what they thought was the earliest colony they ever established -- a place that they called Pithaecusa, which is the island of Ischia. Delphi was thought by the Greeks to be the navel of the universe, the center in every way. There the god Apollo had established an oracle. Gases would escape through this gap in the earth and there were priests who worshipped Apollo there. They would place a young woman there who would sit as these gases came up. She would after a while begin to speak in tongues, which is to say she would rattle off a lot of language which nobody could understand what she was saying. will decide whether it's a good idea for him or not. Recruiting is tremendously important because you need to have a certain number of settlers to make the settlement viable. So however many that is, that is what you try to recruit and you recruit typically at a time when it's easy to get people together so you can tell them the story. There are festivals held in each city just for its own citizens and my guess is that when you could do that, when you felt that you could recruit a full colony from your fellow citizens in Corinth, let us say, that's what you did. were not enough Corinthians who were ready to go with you on your expedition. So, you would try to take your message to one of the Pan-Hellenic festivals which were getting organized about this time. So now you have everything in place, you've recruited your settlement, you get on your ships and sail, in this case out to the west central Mediterranean. You find your way to Sicily, work your way into the harbor at Syracuse and things work out, and now we have this apoikia called Syracuse. The city of Corinth sent out a lot of colonies, which is why we know something about their arrangements. When Potidaea got into trouble with Athens, and found itself besieged, Corinth sent a real army to go in there and fight. At the other end of the spectrum it's again Corinth and they have a colony up in the northwest called Corcyra. The first relationship between them is a navel battle, and thereafter we hear of them quarrelling and fighting with each other just about at least once a century right on down. Kagan: The overwhelming normal situation is the first one I described, friendly relations. colonies to send representatives back to the mother city for the religious observations that were common to them all, so that those create good feelings. Corinth always needs that kind of stuff, so we sell you our wheat, you sell us your pottery, we sell good wine that we can't grow yet and maybe never will be able to grow in our neighborhood, so on and so forth. So you can see why it would be very natural for all sorts of ties to unite these colony and mother city. The states who are doing most of the colonizing are located where most. of the trade was going on at this point in history. These places are the ones that have the trade, the industry, and also engage in colonization. As we will see, there will be internal trouble in the form of political quarreling, economic conflict, and finally warfare, civil wars occur in some of these cities. In the next topic I'll turn to, of the establishment of tyrannies, as the way of resolving for a time these terribly tumultuous conditions in those cities. especially, some scholars have pointed out, I think persuasively, also for some considerable time provided an answer to that problem in the form of an escape valve. People who were losers and angry and troubled, or people who had in any case were not happy with the way things were going in their mother city. Well, they didn't have to stay and fight it out. They could go away and they did, in very considerable numbers. So, that's part of the story of why America had the very lucky early history that it had.

Summary:
well welcome back everybody to uh the last lecture 162. this is kind of a a special lecture um i did get some requests for more information about distributed storage and quantum computing and so i think we're going to do that. i want to make sure that we talk through the chord algorithm since that's a i think relatively simple thing to understand and is very cool and applied pretty much everywhere so if you remember one of the things we talked about last week was basically this cap theorem which was really a conjecture that eric brewer put forth back in the early 2000s. is a good way to understand global storage systems as a result now um at the very end of uh last lecture we were talking about key value stores. Key value stores are very simple in interface excuse me so basically uh you can have an arbitrary key although that's usually a hash over some value. You can have a value associated with it and if you do put a key comma value that goes somewhere into the ether and then when you do get of the key you get back the value that you started with. The cord algorithm has been turned into storage systems of many sorts including those used by amazon et cetera okay facebook. The chord algorithm lets you get by with only knowing essentially a logarithmic number of nodes in the total system and you can still do this well. We're going to associate each one of those storage nodes is going to get a unique id. We'll talk you through that in the next slide and then i'm going to show you how the chord algorithm is used to divide our space up. Security is basically computing in the presence of an adversary so i'm assuming several of you have all taken 161. Security is basically using those mechanisms to prevent misuse of resources so for instance virtual memory is a mechanism that can be used for protection. One of the questions that's important is do you know where your data came from that's a provenance question. Data integrity is making sure that the data read only by authorized users so that's an important thing. Non-repudiation is a surprisingly important thing that people don't often talk about. The data capsule infrastructure spans the globe and spans the top of ip g switches which are just on top of g switches. Data capsules are cryptographically hardened bundles of data and if somebody tries to put garbage in there a legitimate person who's trying to look at this can just throw the garbage out. The vision here really is of pretty much everybody using data capsules everywhere okay and um if you can get that to happen then you potentially have a very interesting scenario here now i just wanted to share another point here. unforgeable all right good so let me say a little bit about using quantum mechanics to compute. It's basically using weird but kind of useful properties of quantum mechanics two of them quantization and superposition. If you're willing to allow things to not be always a one or always a zero what you can do is you can just start doing quantum computing. There are many other algorithms out there now these days these days they've been slowly working on them but these are some pretty good ones that might be interesting. high probability some answer that was hard to find that's what we would like okay and so if you look here um you know if the two n inputs are equally probable there could be two to the n outputs that are equally possible and what we'd like is the probability of the outputs to be piled up high on the answer we want. If we can do a fourier transform on some input we can actually get an interesting output. So if we could somehow figure out what r makes this equiv equation satisfied then um we win.

Summary:
So in the next portion of today's lecture we're going to talk about how we can modify the policy gradient calculation to reduce its variance. In this way we'll obtain a version of the policy gradients that can be used as a practical reinforcement learning algorithm. The first trick that we'll start with is going to exploit a property that is always true in our universe which is causality causality says that the policy at time t prime can't affect the reward at another time step t if t is less than t prime. The optimal baseline is not used very much in practical policy grading algorithms but it's perhaps instructive to derive it just to understand some of the mathematical tools that go to studying variants. In many cases when we just need a quick and dirty baseline we'll use average reward however we can actually derive the optimal baseline. In order to find the optimal b i'm going to write down the derivative d var db and solve for the best b so the derivative of the second part is 0 because it doesn't depend on b.

Summary:
Today we're gonna talk about learning in the setting of games. What does learning mean? How do we learn those evaluation functions that we talked about? And then, er, towards the end of the lecture, we wanna talk a little [NOISE] bit about variations of the game- the games we have talked about. So, uh, how about if you have- how about the cases where we have simultaneous games or non-zero-sum games? And an example of that is rock, paper, scissors. Can you still be optimal if you reveal your strategy? somewhere. So, so one idea that we can use here is we can try to generate data based on our current policy pi agent or pi opponent, which is based onOur current estimate of what V is. Right. So currently, I might have some idea of what this V function is. It might be a very bad idea ofwhat V is, but that's okay. I can just start with that and starting with, with that V function that I currently have, what I can do is I can, I can call arg max of V over successors of s and a to get a policy for my agent. So, what you have here is you have a piece of experience; s, a, r, s prime, we can try to learn something from each one of these pieces of experience. And then we had a target that you're trying to get to. And my target, which is kind- kind of acts as a label, is going to be equal to my reward, the reward that I'm getting. So, so my target the thing I'm trying to like get to is the reward plus Gamma V of s Prime, w. Is it possible to have, an end state and not end state have the same feature vector, or no? If you use like, uh, initialize rates do not be zeros which you update throughout instead of just to the end. If there were kind of the same and have same sort of characteristics, it's fine to have feature that gives the same value. If it is always 0, it doesn't matter like what the weight of that entry is. So in general, you wanna have features that are differentiating and you're using it in some way. to 0.25 and 0.75 then it kind of stays there, and you are happy. All right so, so this was just an example of TD learning but this is the update that you have kind of already seen. And then a lot of you have pointed out that this is, this is similar to Q-learning already, right? This is actually pretty similar to update, um, it's very similar, like we have these gradients, and, and the same weight that we have in Q- learning. The idea of learning in games is old. People have been using it. In the case of Backgammon, um, this was around '90s when Tesauro came up with, with an algorithm to solve the game. And he was able to reach human expert play. And then more recently we have been looking at the game of Go. So, in this section we're gonna talk a little bit about AlphaGo Zero too. So if you're attending section I think that will be part of that story. The key idea here is revealing your optimal mixed strategy does not hurt you which is kind of a cool idea. The proof of that is interesting. If you're interested in looking at the notes, you can use linear programming here. So next 10 minutes, I want to spend a little bit of time talking about non-zero-sum games. In real life, you're kind of somewhere in between zero-sum and collaborative games. So, let's motivate that by this idea of Prisoner's dilemma.

We take a needle that has a certain length-- l-- and we throw it at random on the plane. The needle might fall this way, so that it doesn't cross any line, or it might fall that way, and it ends up crossing one of the lines. If the needle is long enough, it might actually end up crossing two of the Lines.

Summary:
David KAISER: In the last few class sessions, we were looking at some changes in high energy particle theory. And then in our most recent class session, we looked at some of the shifts within the fields of study. And today, we're going to focus on a kind of example of that new subfield, a relatively new sub field that's known as inflationary cosmology or simply cosmic inflation. So it's a framework for trying to understand the evolution of our universe over a huge expanse of time, increasingly using tools at the interface. lecture notes on the Canvas site which go into a little bit more detail of some of these parts from the lecture. So oftentimes, astronomers will describe the most salient features of our universe in terms of what they call large scale structure. It turns out that ordinary gravity-- even Newtonian gravity, let alone Einstein's fancier version that we looked at in class, general theory of relativity-- that these gravitational frameworks are sufficient to help us make sense of this hierarchy of scales, of structure across large distance scales. Astronomers like Edwin Hubble in Southern California were able to collect information about the distribution of distant galaxies. Hubble found this remarkable trend that the further away from us a given galaxy was, the faster it tended to be moving away. Lemaitre was one of the first to start thinking about playing that filmstrip backwards to say if things are moving further apart from each other on average today, and if the universe in general is expanding today, then was it, in fact, smaller at earlier times? At early times in cosmic history, the universe should've been opaque. You literally wouldn't have been able to see anything because the mean free path of any given photon would be very, very short. At that moment, the average energy per photon or per elementary particle would fall so that you could actually begin to form stable atoms of hydrogen. After that time, when the temperature has fallen below about 10,000 Kelvin, photons are now free to travel large distances. They lose energy as the universe continues to expand. out I don't attend dance parties very often. This is what the internet tells me they look like. If you just Google "dance party" and throw away the bad pictures-- anyway. So at early times, the DJ's playing some raucous house music, and everyone's just jostling around. The average energy per dancer is very high. That's like the charged particles where the mean free path is effectively zero. No one could cross that dance floor. And then at a calculable moment, if the DJ knows what she's doing, she'll put on some slow music. And you start having couples form like in Harry Potter at the Yule Ball. In 1948, physicists predicted as early as 1948 that there should be this remnant glow from the Big Bang. The idea was the whole universe is filled in the early times with very high energy particles that are at early, early times too high energy to form stable, electrically neutral atoms. The photons aren't just sitting in a bathtub of light, they're just moving through the overall size of space. So the idea was that there would be a point-like source of light coming from that direction of the sky. This day or let's just say earnest disagreement over what's called the cosmic distance ladder. We can get the velocity from these very fancy spectroscopic-- I say we. The people who do it are actually astronomers. They kindly share their information. I don't know how to do it well. But one can do it very, very well. What's hard to do is to calibrate. How far away is that object right now, let alone how quickly is it continuing to move away? Astronomer Hubble measured a much quicker average rate of expansion than what we have mostly settled on today. The picture was enough to get a small number of people to pay attention to Georges Lemaitre's otherwise quite obscure mathematical solutions. This is actually called conformal time, which might remind you of our beloved friends, the 19th century Cambridge Wranglers. We're really doing a very similar thing here, to adopt coordinates for the rate at which time takes into account changing rates over time. the Big Bang model had some amazing successes but some pretty stubborn quandaries as well. So I'll pause there again and ask the questions about that. Any questions on the shortcomings of the Big Bang as people began articulating them throughout the '60s and '70s? Feel free to jump in or use the chat or either way. And again, there's more on the quantitative details of that in that optional primer you can find on the Canvas site. So Fisher asks, is it useful to think of the universe as spherical still? Yeah. Planck collaboration using a satellite is that this parameter in our actual universe today is 1 to better than a percent level accuracy. This is a remarkable shift even over the course of 20 to 25 years, let alone since the days of Lemaitre and Hubble. If inflation happened, there should've been a very brief period before what had previously been called the Big Bang. So then it would at least be plausible there's at least now a causally self-consistent mechanism by which the universe could have similar conditions everywhere.

Summary:
The Peloponnesian War was fought in 431 BC. After the war, Spartan power had grown to an unprecedented degree. For the first time there were lots of Spartans, who had lots of money. The Spartans had choices that they could take. They could either stay in the Pelop onnesus, or they could contest it in their power to control the entire Greek world in the east. Or they could have some control of the Aegean and the Hellespont. Thrasybulus, the leader of the Thirty, was deposed by a group of 3,000. He appealed to Sparta for help against this democratic army that he had put out. The Spartans did vote to send an army in there to deal with Thrasy Bulus, but they did not put Lysander at the head of the army. Instead King Pausaniasas was sent out to do the job, they met under ThrasyBulus and defeated him. For one thing, as they had in the past, the Athenians fought bravely and well and inflicted serious losses on the army, but it was also obvious that Pausanas was willing to negotiate.

Summary:
The coherent state has a simple definition, simple but subtle. It's an eigenstate of the annihilation operator, and it has a complex eigenvalue alpha. The person who popularized those states was Glauber, and he got amply rewarded for that. We are now using the coherent states to look at any other quantum state of the electromagnetic field, any statistical operator which describes photons by forming the diagram matrix element of the statistical operator with alpha. And now we realize that coherent states are not as wonderful as I believe. In quantum mechanics, number and phase are complimentary. If the number of photons is fixed, you know nothing about the phase. The energy is sharp of a number state, since the energy is e squared. But what you get is also something blurred on the order of unity. And the time dependence is very easy. After all, we're dealing with an harmonic oscillator. In an harmonic. oscillator, if you have a plane of x and p, symmetric and anti-symmetric combination of a. and a dagger, the quantum state is just rotating circle, a rotation with omega. have a product which is fully symmetric i in the ordering of x p, which is anti-normal or normal. The reason why I picked for the course Q of alpha is that it's a real probability, it's always positive. The other guys, P of alpha, can be positive or negative. And also, W of alpha can be negative or positive. But the fact is all three have their advantages and disadvantages. So they all have pluses and minuses. And as a result, it can be written like this. the coherent state is now not this Gaussian. It doesn't have thisGaussian distribution as a course of probability. It's what you want-- what maybe some of you wanted to see-- oh, by the way, it's a delta function. And finally, W stands for Wigner distribution, which is something you actually find in most quantum mechanics textbooks. But of course it has a disadvantage that it has negative values. Some people actually see negative probabilities spring out the non-classical character. The fluctuations of the intensity are usually expressed by the second order temporal coherence function. We have learned about one way to characterize uncertainties-- the quantumness of the electromagnetic field-- by looking at the uncertainties in the x and p variable. And that led us to minimum uncertainty states. Now, I want to now introduce to you two other ways of characterizing the uncertainty of quantum states of light. Right now, we have asked, What are the fluctuations in the electric field? But the next question is, What is the fluctuation in the photon number? Professor: Measurement of light intensity really means absorbing photons. Professor: As long as we limit ourselves to a single mode of the electromagnetic field, things are independent of tau. He says if you have 1 mode of light, there is no time for time to get out of phase with the light. Prof. Cody: So you find everything you want to for time for light, which has a peak, which is a peak of g2. And if you would rotate your head at omega omega, nothing will happen. The Hanbury Brown Twiss experiment was the first experiment which really looked at g2 functions correlations. It was the beginning of quantum optics and modern experiments with light. The classical limit is always a limit of high intensity, so at any given time, you have a ton of photons. If you put a light bulb into a cavity or couple the light from a light bulbs into a fiber, the light becomes spatially a single mode. That's the only way how you can distinguish a lightbulb from a laser beam.

Summary:
This lesson will first dive into some signal Theory and then move on into things that we're more familiar with things like deconvolutions and using Transformers for next note prediction. The first thing we want to talk about is how can we sample and quantize a continuous time signal. We'll then go into some geometric signal theory and with Transformers and finally how how we can kind of generate sounds using these. The lesson will end with a soft introduction to digital signals and then we'll move on to the next lesson. Not very easy for a computer to do given that every operation needs to be in on a continuous time signal. The way that we we can fix that is through the process of discretization or to to make a an analog signal a digital signal for us to be able to process. The two kind of main ways that we can make our signal easier to process is one by taking samples at certain time periods and two by quantizing our level so instead of dealing with A continuous scale we can quantize at certain levels. The aliasing phenomenon is incredibly interesting this happens both visually and um auditorily. aliasing is the byproduct of poor sampling. A lower wave resolution will result in a modified output signal as compared to the original input that we're trying to process. There's a lot of literature about um aliasing effects including spatial illnessing. The effect of aliasing on digital signal processing can be seen in a number of different ways including in the way that the image is compressed and the way it's displayed. The more information you have and the more generalizability you have in your Transformer the better it'll perform. The next thing to consider is positional beat encoding. We want to include some metadata to feed into our model to give it a better sense of musical timing. The last thing to talk about is teacher forcing. When training Transformers you want a way to mask information. You don't want to give the Transformer all the information because then it won't learn a very good representation of the data that you're providing. things a try yourself uh yeah thank you guys for tuning in have a good one.

Summary:
Learn how the solar cell device converts sunlight, the input energy, to some usable output energy, which is in the form of electricity, typically, from a solar panel. Learn how to minimize the amount of light reflected or not absorbed into maximizing amount of life that's actually absorbed. Learn about the duality of light, or how to think about light as a particle, or alternatively, as a quantified particle. Use the weekly Newsquiz to test your knowledge of stories you saw on MIT OpenCourseWare. Most often, depending on the angle, you have what is called total internal reflection. The record efficiency solar cell that was announced this past year in gallium arsenide was achieved because of good light management. To engineer front and back surface reflectances, you really have to carefully select your refractive indices and your materials if you put on either side. If we go to a refractive index material of minus 1.3, will we change the reflectivity at all? It depends, but the answers here are shown, for this particular system. There is a limit to how much we can trap light simply by modifying or corrugating the surfaces. A gentleman by the name of Eli Yablonovitch, who's now a professor in Berkeley calculated these parameters I think back in 1982. He came up with an upper limit to the optical path length. That's a pretty good litmus test for the ability of a material to trap light. If you have silicon, for instance, with a refractive index of, let's say, in the infrared some around 3.6, your Yabonovitch limit is around 50. In most solar cells, we want to suppress reflection. We go to great lengths to make sure that this thickness as well as the refractive index of the material is optimized for a particular system. So calculate for me what is the optimal thickness of an anti-reflection coating of silicon nitride? And we'll give it a refractiveIndex of, say, 2.1. Let's call it 2, just make our lives simple. And the peak of the solar spectrum is 550 nanometers. on light trapping and light management. Mostly it's for photonic devices, but they can be transferred over into solar cells as well. And another example of the photon up/down converters, there's recent reports in SPIE, a lot of interest in the optics community. There was a TR35 award given to a person who studying this topic. So it is, as well, a very exciting and up and coming field. Again, the opportunities there of manipulating light are large, are vast.

Summary:
JACK HARE: Let's do a little recap on electron cyclotron emission. We expect to have multiple different peaks, even from a single particle. These peaks are going to be occurring at frequencies. And we can say this is m equals 1, m equals 2,. m equals 3. And they're evenly spaced. And so, we have these peaks here. But if we neglect that, the frequency depends only on the magnetic field. So, if you see some emission at some certain frequency, then you know that it's been emitted by a region of plasma which has this magnetic fields. can get very detailed. So in ASDEX Upgrade, we don't really have a circular cross-section plasma, but I'm just drawing it like that, be a nice D-shaped plasma, got our plasma inside here. And our system, at first glance, looks an awful lot like the system that we sketched out up here. We're not trying to measure the temperature profile throughout the entire plasma. We want to measure it inside some very small region. So the size of our turbulence of R turb, is on the order of 100 microns. That's the width of a human hair. many oscillations. And so, it will average out to-- well, because it's power, it'll average out out to 1 or something like that. So it's some DC offset that we can subtract off after. So all this is doing here is mixing the signal down so it gets to a regime that we could effectively digitize. Yeah, another question. [INAUDIBLE] JACK HARE: So if we were doing geometric optics, which we're not, then you would have a lens like this. That lens could collimate your beam. The idea here is that there was some region over which, in the transverse direction perpendicular to your collection volume, you have a very narrow scale. This means that you can actually collect from a very small region on the order of 100 microns. What they were actually doing with this system is all of these were very tunable. And so, if they wanted to look at turbulence in the edge or turbulence near the center, they could actually tune all their bandpass filters to do that. Watts: The technique is used in a variety of applications. He says it's used to extract temperature from the noise of plasma. Watts: The noise is uncorrelated at random, but these two signals will correlate together, and we'll be able to measure it. The temperature and the noise are correlated, he says, and that's what makes it useful in a lot of cases. The technique can also be used to detect cancerous cells in the human body, Watts says. This technique is incredibly powerful because it's enabled people to measure, again, delta Te upon Te on the order of 1%. And they've done this at 13-- on ASDEX Upgrade-- 13 radial locations. So 13 positions they can measure these temperature fluctuations. And they have done this with a time step of 100 kilohertz. So 100,000 times a second they've been able to measure theseTemperature fluctuations. So on very small scales, very fast time scales, we can now measure temperature fluctuations in a tokamak. situation where, at some point, your eddy has moved across, and these two are no longer correlated because the next two are correlated. So it-- yeah. I think we're reaching the limits of my knowledge. JACK HARE: I mean, there's no reason to believe that each of the fluctuations is the same size. So this is going to be a time-evolving system here.Yeah, exactly. Cool. Any other questions? Anything online? Now we're going to go to bremsstrahlung. here with the ions and electrons as point particles. There's a semi-classical approach where you start bringing in some quantum physics and treat, I think, the electron as a wave. And then there's a full quantum approach. What's remarkable about all of these approaches is they all give the same answer with just a very slightly different coefficient. So we get a small change in coefficient. The scalings are the same. So, in some sense, although it's important to get the exact coefficient, it doesn't matter exactly which one of these techniques you use. This is the spectrum coming out of a plasma that's emitting bremsstrahlung radiation. This, therefore, has units of watts per hertz per meter cubed. And then, there's a factor called G bar, the Gaunt factor, which we'll talk about in a moment, and lots of other constants. And so, this emissivity, as a function of photon energy, is a very simple function. It just decays exponentially with photon energy. And that is all you need to do Problem Set 3. at synchrotron, yes. Jack Hare: "I don't know if people are using it as a diagnostic. I've not heard of someone using it" "I think someone told me that maybe for a high field tokamaks synch rotron could start being significant" "But I actually have no idea how big a deal it is" "It depends mostly on the magnetic field and the radius. And those are two things in a toKamak you already know" "So worth thinking about" where we have a range of different discrete energy levels that the electrons can occupy. These energy levels are labeled by the principal quantum number n. And the energies of these levels are given by this unit, Ry, which is the Rydberg z squared of our ion over n squared. Up here, infinity, this is ionization. If your electron gets this much energy, it becomes free again. And so, what we're going to see in our spectrum is that this is only allowed if the electron energy fulfills this equation. JACK HARE: We're going to get to that and the idea of detailed balance and thermodynamic equilibrium and things of that ilk. One use of this is a diagnostic called bolometry. It cares not at all about the detailed spectrum of what the emission is. It just wants to know how much power is being radiated by the plasma. So, bolometry is focused on measuring the total power that's being emitted. And we'll talk more about how to do that in the next step. This is often made out of gold. Gold is chosen because it absorbs all wavelengths relatively evenly. This thin layer of gold has been deposited on top of a substrate. And it's on the back of the substrate that you have your resistor. And depending on whether it is M or R, you either have this open to the plasma or you have a thick block some distance in front of it so it can't see the plasma. It's the heat capacity of the absorber, c, that goes into our previous equation. difference between those. neutron damage leads us to use much thicker substrates, which gives us a longer time response and so, therefore, a worse bolometer. So, ironically, the bolometers that will be used on [INAUDIBLE] are significantly worse than the bolometer used on existing devices. And I'm sure that [? Spark ?] will have exactly the same problem. Almost everyone in the world uses this design of bolometer that they pioneered on ASDEX Upgrade in the '80s. No one has come up with a better system yet.

Summary:
So, last time we were starting to talk about the sort of the general overview of what reinforcement learning involves. We introduced the notion [NOISE] of a model, a value, and a policy. Can anybody remember off the top of their head what a model was in the context of reinforcement learning? So what we're gonna do today is, sort of, um, build up for Markov Processes, up to Markov Decision Processes. And this build, I think, is sort of a nice one because it allows one to think about what happens in the cases where you might not have control over the world. Markov Decision Processes are the same as the Markov Reward Process except for now we have actions. So, the agent is in a state they take an action, they get immediate reward, and then they transition to the next state. The advantage of this is that each of the iteration updates are cheaper and they'd also will be some benefits later when we start to think about actions. Now, if we think about our Mars Rover MDP, let's just define there being two actions being A1 and A2. expected discounted sum of rewards. Now you might ask, okay well they- are they ever guaranteed to stop changing? And we'll get to that part later. We're going to get to the fact that this whole process is guaranteed to be a contraction so it's not going to go on forever. So the distance between the value functions is going to be shrinking. And that's one of the benefits of the discount factor. So if people don't have any more immediate questions, I suggest we all take a minute and then just compare with your neighbor of what number you get when you do this computation. There exists a unique optimal value function. The optimal policy for an MDP and an infinite horizon finite state MDP is deterministic. There are two choices for every state and there are seven states. The [NOISE] number of policies is |A| to the |S|. It's a mapping from states to actions so it's gonna be 2 to the 7th. We'll talk about- probably a little bit clearer to when we talk about contraction properties later. Um, any one want to take a guess of whether or not the optimal policy is always unique? I think there might be cases where it's not. on sort of the contraction operator. So, if an operator is a contraction it means that if you apply it to two different things, you can think of these as value functions. The distance between them shrinks after, um, or at least is no bigger after you apply the operator compared to their distance before. So how do we prove this? Um, we prove it- for interest of time I'll show you the proof. Again, I'm happy to go through it,. um, I- or we can go throughIt in office hours et cetera.

Summary:
Professor: angular momentum is a set of operators that provide observables, things we can measure. He says they're particularly important for systems in which you have central potentials. Professor: If you have two energy for every system except for every energy except for 0, you have a problem. You know the problem, if you can uniquely characterize the states of the system, then you can learn more about the physics of this state, he says, and you can also know more about physics of a circle. and an electron we can reduce this system to as if we had one particle in a central potential. So that will be also very important physically. And here there is a simple observation that one can make. Is that the differential equation for p l m depends on m squared. We expect to need values of m that are positive and negative. The complex conjugate ones should be thought as having m negative. So we expect positive andnegative m's to be allowed. So how did people figure this out? They, in fact, figured out that if you have these polynomials you can create automatically the solutions for this equation. that don't diverge. So this is very important. It shows that there is one more constraint on your quantum numbers. This formula you may forget, but you should never forget this one. This one says that if you choose some l which corresponds to choosing the magnitude of the angular momentum, l is the eigenvalue. You will have several possibilities for m. There will be several states that have the same l, but m different. So in general when we choose an arbitrary l, then m goes from minus l, minus l plus 1 all the way up to l.

There are three common uses of a rotation matrix. The first is to represent an orientation. The second is to change the frame of reference of a vector. And the third is to rotate a vector or frame. To demonstrate these, I will use these three coordinate frames, representing the same space with different orientations. To help you visualize these frames in 3 dimensions, I’ll use my handy tinkertoy frame. This is the z-axis, this is the x-axis and the y-axis. we will learn how to represent the angular velocity of a frame. We will also learn about how to use the frame to represent a frame's angular velocity. We'll also look at how the frame is used to represent an object's speed. We hope you will join us for the next few weeks of classes on how to work with a frame in this class. The next class will be on the physics of the frame in which we are working. The final class will take place in the next week or so.

 RAMESH RASKAR: So this is a position, and this is superposition. And that concept of a position or superposition applies to all three types, shadows- or refraction- or reflection-based techniques. So we saw this last time, and we'll see how-- we already have some projects that are inspired by biological vision. You know, Matt is trying the chicken. And I think it's going to be-- [LAUGHTER] It is going to. In a typical film camera, or even it is digital camera, you take the picture, and that's basically the end of the story. Here, you're trying to do something clever about how the picture is taken. You can either take a really short exposure photo, but that's going to be very dark. Or you can just take a long-exposure photo by keeping the shutter open. But then you will get a blurry photo, which is well exposed, but a lot of the high-frequency details are lost. In communication theory, everything is [INAUDIBLE].. We think about carrier frequencies of radio stations in frequencies. It's the same thing that's going on here. And convolution, deconvolution-- much easier to think in frequency domain. Although all the analysis in the frequency domain, at the end, the solution is very easy-- just flutter the shutter or just put a coded aperture. The bokehs are-- it depends on your-- I mean, for your average consumer, I don't know whether this matters. In astronomy, you have circular convolution because they use either a mirror or one mirror. If you put two tiles, you'll get really horrible frequency response. So if you're tiling that up-- RAMESH RASKAR: It's impressive, that's saying [INAUDIBLE] It's not a brute-force search. It was an intelligent search. We came up with our own code called RAT code, R-A-T, which is after three quarters. It's a very clean and beautiful and smoother course work. Ramesh Raskar: Compressive sensing or compressed imaging is taking a picture with a hardware and compressing the software. He says the idea is to take a photo and compress it down to 10,000 bytes. RaskAR: The theory of compressive sensing is that that's the basis for compressive imaging, which can be exploited while I'm sensing, OK?

Summary:
Prof. Clark: Middle class was a form of self-identity that was constructed in the way being a worker was constructed, or being a noble. When you see Daumier or you see Delacroix's famous, Liberty Leading the People, and you see the bourgeois, there with his top hat, he's dressed in a bourgeois uniform like this. That emerges out of the bourgeois century. The middle classes started dressing like this in the nineteenth century, dark with a little bit of color. Once we've got an increase in the wealth of the middle classes, then you wanted the political power. The French Revolution opened the way by removing legal blocks in very many places to the career open to talents. The bourgeoisie did anything but that. Work was part of how they believed to get ahead, and getting ahead is what they wanted to do. The middle class formed voluntary associations, and many of these were for extremely charitable purposes, particularly in Britain. The Society for the Protection of Cruelty to Animals is one of the classic examples of these sorts of organizations. They get together to hang out each other and sort of try to gauge who has more money than the other. In France after the Paris Commune of 1871 they start building churches in the working class districts perched on the edge of cities. Religion for the middle classes has a greater role in their lives than in working class cities. The old Hanseatic port cities of German, the German free cities that would become part of unified Germany in 1871--northern German cities in general, like Bremen, and Lübeck, and Hamburg above all. Barcelona is a really natural economy based on important economic relations between its hinterland and the world. In France in 1830, yet another one that you can read about, there's a revolution in France. It brings to power in France the big bourgeoisie, and they have the ear of the king, Louis-Philippe, who calls himself the Citizen King. Then at the bottom you have the petty bourgeoisie, but they too had a self-identity. Lots of these classically new nineteenth-century professions--schoolteachers, doctors, notaries. They were a way of social mobility for peasant families. as a jungle. In several hundred brushstrokes, Daumier captures the look of panic on his face because he's going to go home without his hat. He's got to buy one, and they've got to put the money together so he is not going to fall off the ladder in this jungle. Then you have to imagine this as a ladder, like this. In order to really give an image of what it was like, he's got this one magnificent print called the "Street of the Four Winds" Daumier is the greatest caricaturist in the nineteenth century. He captures the prevailing mood in much of Europe in that money, more than blood. The bourgeoisie didn't kiss and hug a lot, but he's got his hand draped rather daintily on the old guy's arm. He's not about to embrace him and give him a big kiss on each cheek. One day all of this stuff will be his, if he plays his cards right. Love could still be something, but economic relationships were still essentially, less so for the middle classes than ordinary relationships. Middle class helped create the notion of childhood, says author. The notion of the children's hour was inconceivable for the majority of Europeans. The French middle class, particularly in France, started reducing their number of children because they could get around it by primogeniture. The middle class wants privacy and they also developed something else, he says. The idea of a children's room, of having your own room or a room shared with a sibling, was something that was just inconceivable. birthday, papa." You didn't take time out to celebrate a birthday if you were an ordinary person having to get to the fields at 4:00 in the morning in the summer, or going to work during the day. There's a whole notion, and here again this would probably fit rather awkwardly into the birth control description, but there's this whole sense of being prepared that emerges with the middle class. It was the idea of protecting that one suit. We didn't carry umbrellas, because it rained all the time anyway and I'd just lose it. The bourgeoisie, the middle classes, and this is particularly true of Germany and France, and of England, too, and other places--they want the right to bear arms. They want to be in the national guard. The national guard might hypothetically be there in case there was an invasion of France or Germany by, I don't know, some distant place, the Fins or something most unlikely. But the main reason they wanted to join the national Guard was to be able to vote. You had to be defined as a property-owning citizen to have the right.

Researchers have confirmed a second smaller space Rock smashed into the sea off the coast of West Africa creating a large crater during the same era. Scientists say it would have caused a tsunami at least 800 M High to tear across the Atlantic Ocean. The asteroid that's believed to have wiped them out 66 million years ago was not the only one researchers have confirmed. The discovery is exciting that it happens to be potentially close to the same time as the chicku event known to be the the main cause of the extinction event that killed the dinosaurs.

In automotive design Dynamics plays a very important part because it's not rigid body Dynamics it's a bunch of rigid bodies with springs the Springs are called starts with an S suspens suspensions right and there's a trade-off between how comfortable the ride is and how tightly the car handles. In Dynamics there two sides to it one is how will its various degrees of freedom behave over time if you you know stretch it and let it go and it goes twang you know boing right and you want to figure out how it goes in time that that's analysis. 4 was due uh is due on Wednesday the 10th and the reason is there's no class next Monday and um we posted the solution to that problem from class uh just one last thing I won't have officers today only because you don't want to hear me Babel I'm really sick um but I'm also going to change my officers um several people suggest so the timing isn't right um so we'll talk about the end of class but I I might go to like a Monday off M um like later on a Monday or maybe Wednesday later or something like that. Just hang out like at 3:00 p.m. on a Saturday is that something that you you folks would find useful okay we'll do that okay um so here's what we going to look at what no okay we're going to see our first angular momentums and torqus today. So consider a frame consider a point fixed in frame and this is an inertial frame and a pointfixed in that frame o okay now let's consider a particle P by the way when I say particle a point mass or in context point I'm referring to the same thing essentially I'm refer to something with no Dimensions but with a finite Mass. A lot of MIT grads old friends work all over the world very important positions around the world for example the foreign minister of the new British government is an MIT grad. One of my friends Works in a congressional he she helps Congressional analyze things from a physics point of view so you know when Katrina occurred someone asked if it would be possible to change the temperature in the when when a hurricane approaches to dissipate the temperature. She did some analysis and showed that you need something like a nuclear weapon but like you know the most the largest the largest. nuclear weapon ever conceived to even you know impact it by like 2% because the energy in a in a hurricane all right I told you I'd Babble all right let's do a problem here's a problem so imagine a um a table right you notice I've drawn it in perspective you know what perspective is right it's very cool it wasn't intentional but looks good I see everything in perspective right now okay I have a hole on this table right so this is a table and and um it's frictionless hockey puck basically a point map attached by a string and the string comes through the hole. call this Theta the initial length is L one and the initial velocity is we'll call it a scalar because this is how I'm defining the problem of V1 when we actually solve it we might have to define a vector okay. As the thing's going around this person is going to pull the string down and as it kind of goes around it's going to spiral in and end up it's a new length L2 and the question is what is V2 going to be okay so I'll let you uh let resolve this for a second. that stuff let's let's examine it from a uh from a basic you know intuition point of view from what we studied so far first of all when is linear momentum conserved forget this in general linear momentum is conserved when what condition occurs no external Force right so let's study this guy this particle as it moves around does it feel an external Force let's do a free body diagram on this particle um o Point p as the particle moves around kind of intuitively which direction is it accelerating in kind of cental right. would have to do one of two things I would have had to either calculate this term or calculate or make you know make my frame attach it to the truck. I've just done it in a very precise way okay so in the end there's no surprise the whole point is to show you they could be surprises but be careful any questions about this all right snap quiz in the next 3 minutes I want you to calculate for me the final velocity literally 3 minutes because I have toDo the dumbbell problem. p and particle Q is that reasonable it's perfectly reasonable but do I have a kinematic constraint and what would the kinematics constraint be H yeah it's a they connected by a rigid body so they can do whatever they want as long as the length between the two of them remains constant right by the way if instead of a rigid bar if I had a string connecting them what would  the kinemic constraint be less than equal to to R right but in this case it's  a rigid bar so it's equal to R to R. we'll show is that the acceleration of the center of mass is uh related to the total force and the angular acceleration of. the whole rigid body is related to torque and we'll show it okay and then we'll generalize it. Define angular acceleration and moment of inertia and a more General sense okay so let's stop here because we are over time. We're going to take a break. We'll be back in a few minutes. We've got a lot to talk about.

Summary:
In this module, I'm going to briefly introduce the idea of differentiable programming. Differentiable programming is closely related to deep learning. I've adopted the former term as an attempt to be more precise in terms of highlighting the mechanics of writing models as you would code. So let's begin with our familiar example, a simple neural network. And this is the programming part of differentable programming which allows you to build up an increasingly more sophisticated model without losing track of what's going on. Convolutional neural networks are a refinement of a fully connected neural network. ConvNets have two basic building blocks. Conv takes an image and the image is represented as a volume which is a collection of matrices. Each matrix has the same dimensionality as the image. Conv is going to compute another volume of a different size, usually the height and width of this volume. And at the end, you get a vector representing the probabilities of the different object categories. Click here for Andrej Karpathy's excellent demo where you can actually create and train ConvNet in your browser. be learned. The second thing is I also haven't specified the hyperparameters which is the number of channels, the filter sizes, and so on, which are actually pretty important for getting a good performance. But I just wanted to highlight the overarching structure and the idea that you can compose in a fairly effortless way. So now let's turn our attention to natural language processing. So here is a motivating example. Suppose we want to build a question answering system. We have a paragraph. It's from Wikipedia and we have a question. We want to select the answer from that passage, from the paragraph. In NLP, words are discrete objects and neural networks speak vectors. So whenever you're doing NLP with neural nets, you first have to embed words, or more generally, tokens. There's a lot of processing that needs to happen and it's hard to kind of specify in advance. A SequenceModel is going to be something that takes a sequence of input vectors and produces a corresponding sequence of output vectors where each vector in this sequence is a process with respect to the other elements. I'm going to talk about two implementations of the sequence models. One is recurrent neural networks and one is transformers. Here is one of the input vectors. x1, x2, x3, x4. I'm going to reduce its dimensionality to also 3 dimensions. And now I can take the dot product between these x's and y's. So that's an attention mechanism. You can think about this as a sequence model that just takes input sequence and contextualizes the input vector into output vectors. And if this is junk, then anything that I build on top of that is junk. processing each xi in context. Now we have enough that we can actually build up to BERT which was this complicated thing that I mentioned at the beginning. So BERT is this large unsupervised pretrained model which came out in 2018 which has really kind of transformed NLP. And the basic building block for generation is, I'm going to call it GenerateToken. And you take a vector x and you generate token y. And this is kind of the reverse of EmbedToken which takes a token and produces a vector. encourage you to consult the original source if you want kind of the actual, the full gory details. Another thing I haven't talked about is learning any of these models. It's going to be using some variant of stochastic gradient descent, but there's often various tricks that are needed to get it to work. But maybe the final thing I'll leave you with is the idea that all of differentiable programming is built out of modules. Even if you kind of don't understand or I didn't explain the details, I think it's really important to pay attention to the type signature of these functions.

Summary:
Professor Amy Hungerford: Today it is my great privilege and pleasure to introduce Andrew Goldstone, a TF in this course. Andrew is a fourth-year student in the Ph.D. program in English, and he is writing a dissertation on the autonomy of the work of art in modernism. On Monday we had three main themes that were used to introduce this novel to you. And that's the question that I'm mostly going to focus on today. I'm going to bracket the ethical question, leave that for Monday's lecture. Nabokov's relationship to this modernist past is not just the burlesque that he visits on Eliot. An element of admiration is also present, and that's really part of his relationship to Joyce. I'm just going to name for you four features of Joyce's style that are important to Nabokov: stylistic virtuosity, the ability to imitate any style; at the same time, a scrupulous attention to the banality of everyday life and all its detail. Third characteristic, the constant use of a superimposed structure. Nabokov's Lolita is a kind of artificial, processed, bland, easily consumable version of fate. In other words, chance is already fated. The thing that stands for randomness in this book, the thing that looks like ordinary detail, has already been arranged to give you artistic pleasure. This kind of transformation of arbitrary, real fated events into conspicuously artificial tricks is a response to exile, in particular to Nabokov’s condition of exile. foreign country, lives in a kind of denaturalized world, a world where, instead of everything making instant sense everything has to be decoded. In that afterword to this book, Nabokov says he had to invent America. That's because he didn't know it already; it wasn't given to him. In a way this is a terrible state, a state of discontinuity with the world you exist in. But it has a payoff, kind of, a payoff which is the possibility precisely of inventing. because Humbert is a foreigner--into something you can laugh at. The foreigner's love for this kind of move is a response to this denaturalized world of the exile. The knight's move is nonetheless a kind of wound or damage. So, even as it's the prototype for originality, it's also something very disturbing and harmful. The book was written on road trips. Nabokov's wife, Vera, drove him on thousands of miles of trips around the country while he was writing this novel. evocation of the landscape: By a paradox of pictorial thought, the average lowland North American countryside had at first seemed to me something I accepted with a shock of amused recognition. "Inutile loveliness" is kind of the key word of Nabokov's technique, and he says the novel has as its only purpose to provide aesthetic bliss. So, a European artist actually appears again there, with Claude Lorrain, but kind of made strange: given that knight's move, given a new twist. Nabokov tried to become an American writer, as Nabokov says he's doing: trying to invent America, trying to bridge the gap between Russian and English. He translated Lolita back in to Russian later on, and he added a second afterword where he said: That wondrous Russian tongue that, it seemed to me, was waiting for me somewhere, was flowering like a faithful springtime behind a tightly locked gate whose key I had held in safekeeping for so many years, proved to be nonexistent.

NORVIN RICHARDS: Today is phonetics, which means that today we begin making funny sounds at each other. Let's see. I'm trying to remember if there's anything that I ought to announce. You remember, maybe, that problem set 1, which confusingly is your second problem set, is due on Thursday. Normally, it would be due on Tuesday. But because I am technologically challenged, it's due Thursday. I just figured out how to get the projector to project over there instead of in the middle. Linguists have a system for writing sounds down so that we'll all know what kind of sound we're talking about. The symbols of the International Phonetic Alphabet resemble letters of the English alphabet. The symbol for the sound of the beginning of "face" is an f, and the symbol of the start of "vase" is a v. We'll talk about other kinds of articulation that English doesn't use, but I think that one just doesn't exist. We have started here with symbols that should all look familiar, but as we go along, we will be seeing weirder and weier symbols. In the velar sound, the body of your tongue is up against what's called the velum, which is the soft tissue at the back of your mouth. English doesn't make a huge amount of use of the glottal stop, but it's what shows up at the beginnings of words like "uh-uh," that catch that you're getting in your throat. There are places in English where things that we write as "glottal stops" are actually, in fact, sounds. in mind? STUDENT: No. NORVIN RICHARDS: Oh, OK. We'll get to "r," eventually. People investigate this kind of thing in all kinds of ways. These days, people do a lot of MRIs. There are charts of all of the sounds that we're going to talk about plus many more together with MRIs of the insides of people's mouths making these sounds so that you can see the anatomy. You won't just have to think about it.  phonologist: "cat" and "dog" end in sounds that differ in voicing. "z" is voiced and that "s" is voiceless. "v" is more-- there's more air, I guess, than "f" or "v," but it's not the same. If you whisper "safe," and "save," you have the feeling that you can hear the difference between them. "F" is slower, I think my mouth is opening slower, so yes? So yes? Polish has words that end in "k" and words that ended in "g" underlyingly. Polish also has a rule that changes "g," to "k," at the ends of words. Voiced "b" becomes the voiceless version, which is "p," in Polish. "z" and "d" are voiced, and "t" is voiceless, but both are alveolar, so they're both different from "to" And it's a cross-linguistically quite common phenomenon. English has interdental fricatives and alveolar stops, "t" and "d" There are languages out there that have what are called dental stops. Part of your job, if you're learning Tagalog, for example, is to learn to make dental 't's instead of alveolars. There's all this work on what people do to compensate for various kinds of obstructions in the vocal tract. And on the website, there will be a link to charts that will have more official charts by the IPA.

Aristotle was born 384,15 years after the trial of Socrates. He was sent by his father to go to college. Unlike most of you, Aristotle did not spend four years at the Platonic Academy. He remained attached to it for the next 20, until the death of Plato. Unlike his intellectual godfather, Socrates, who wrote nothing but conversed endlessly, Aristotle wrote disciplined and thematic treatises on virtually every topic. He collected constitutions, 158 of them in all, from throughout the ancient world. Aristotle says man is political not because we have some biological impulse or instinct that drives us to participate in politics, but because we are possessed of the power of speech. It is a reason or speech, not instinct, that makes us political, he says. To say it's natural for us to do so is not to say we engage in political life spontaneously and avidly, as you might say spiders spin webs or ants build anthills, he writes. The power to know is our ability to recognize, by sight, members of the same polis or city.

In real life, it is possible that a person derives some satisfaction from having some money left in his pocket, but the way this problem has been framed here the person’s satisfaction depends only on his level of consumption of good 1, and good 2.

So I think the fact that it's a personal vehicle, I think it's important. So the key in this is, describe the concept using few words precisely, but to set it apart from neighboring concepts. What about Rolex Center? It's a single-layer building with multiple straw used as a library for people to meet and study. built. The first thing you do is understand where is the value-- the stakeholders and the stakeholder analysis and the requirements definition. And then you interpret and incorporate some of the needs into goals, which become requirements. And so the goals then are an instrument of the primary delivery value delivering process, which is your value proposition. To then actually deliver that value you need to design the product, the product system, and understand the operand, the thing that is being operated on or transformed by the primary value delivery process. In order to chill, we need a chiller, and there are different types of chillers, like a cooler or refrigerator. The key idea is start thinking in this abstract way, and all of a sudden all these other possibilities become possible. Once we have that, we can start managing complexity, decomposing function and form. And then our system object, you can decompose it into different elements, supporting systems, the operand, the operator, and so forth. It's the combination of this specific way you're going to operate the system. for something very simple like a cooler. architecture selects the concept, the decomposition, mapping of function to form. Design, then, given that, selects the actual values for those design variables, and then you can optimize. People in the US, we like to have big refrigerators, big gallon of milk, and refrigerators in Switzerland are much smaller. The real complexity comes in when you look at the form form mapping. So this is then the decomposing of the refrigerator in terms of all the elements of form and how they relate to each other. is concept generation. So take the requirements and think creatively about how these requirements could be fulfilled. Once you have several concepts, you've got to select among them, which we'll talk about next week. It's about starting with the operand. What is the thing that the beneficiary, the stakeholder cares about, and how do we transform that? Concept then elaborate these into architectures that have form function and structural complexity. And then the goodness of an architecture is really a pretty complex concept. There's got to be a driving question for the brainstorming session. There's an ideal group size, and it says 5 to 10 here, but I should probably revise this to be-- what do you think? 7 plus minus 2. The idea is to produce a large amount of ideas and then at some point, maybe 30 to 60 minutes, Brainstorming session that last four hours is probably really good and then the rest is kind of shot and there's not a lot of new ideas coming. Leonardo was a head of his time in many ways. So he's really been identified as an exceptional individual. How to Think Like Leonardo, Seven Steps to Genius, is a book on creativity. The seven da Vincian principles of creativity are here in Italian. They include curiosita, lifelong quest for learning. Dimostratzione, testing your knowledge through experience, trying things out. Sensazione, continual refinement of the senses. Mastering ambiguity, paradox, uncertainty. Arte/Scienza is the whole brain thinking, left-right brain. Corporalita, balance of body and mind. or an architecture. So the key decisions are the rows. There are factors in the rows, and then for each row you think about what are the number of possible alternatives for doing this. And then you enumerate all possible combinations. And the big challenge with this, of course, is if you have many factors, you could generate many infeasible architectures. Not all these combinations are actually feasible. And that's where so-called architecture enumeration comes in. The idea is that through creativity, expert knowledge, and analysis you're going to define your components.

Already a few outliers can lead to a environment model which is completely unusable for doing any navigation task so where the geometry of what you computed doesn't fit to the real world geometry anymore and one of the questions actually how to handle that. have also experienced and if you look to those poses over here in the poses down here how those individual structures match um if you just apply let's say scan alignment you may say this may match so maybe someone has opened the door which was closed before or here is a door now closed which was open all the other scans map actually quite well. If you put already ten wrong ones in there it's quite likely to screw up it was one hundred which is still a very small number compared to 3000 or just a small fraction it will actually end up in dramatic mapping errors. The max mixture idea is actually a pretty easy idea pretty simple idea just reply funny no one has done that in robotics until recently a few years ago the first one it was actually edwin olsen and pratik um who came up with that particular with this idea of using max mixtures. The key idea the intuition behind that is if i have a constraint which has a large error so where the um the current configuration is far away from what the constraint tells me just reduce the uh or increase the uncertainty that is associated to that.

Summary:
John Stuart Mill is the principle expositor of neoclassical utilitarianism. The rights-utility synthesis signals that we're looking for an attempt to put together both a commitment to utilitarian efficiency that's grounded in science on the one hand, and respect for individual rights that's grounding in the workmanship ideal on the other hand. At the same time, more or less, there were very important developments in moral philosophy that I just want to alert you to. The doctrine that I'm mentioning here is the doctrine that would come to be called emotivism. as I said, when we get to the anti-Enlightenment and, in particular, Alasdair MacIntyre's book, After Virtue. But today we're going to focus for the rest of our time on the economics of the transition from classical to neoclassical utilitarianism. And I'm going to ask you to suspend disbelief for the whole of today's lecture and just trust me, because what I'mgoing to do is I'mGoing to go into this backwards. I'm Going to look at a very different problem that the neoclassicals economists were concerned with that had nothing to do with utilitarianism, or rights, or anything that we've been talking about. use, yeah, let's use J. If I put a point here, J, we would say that A's gone down and B's gone up. Now, to make this a bit more real imagine in here this is the sphere of market transactions. This is where A and B will go voluntarily, right? So A will say to B, "Well, I have all this wine, and you have all that bread, how about I swap you a bottle of wine for a loaf of bread?" And you say, "Okay." The Pareto principle out of which the whole of neoclassical economic theory was constructed depends on this idea of indifference curves. A is trying to get up on those indifference curves, and B is wanting to get along on them. When they get to a point at which no matter what swap A is willing to propose, B says no, then you know they've hit that frontier, what's called the Pare to possibility frontier. Once they wind up anywhere on this indifference curve they're not going to move of of improving one person's utility.

Summary:
HONG LIU: Today, we talk about chiral fermions. He says the Dirac equation requires, actually, psi to have four components. But there are two ways to reduce it, and one is called the Majorana fermion, he says. HONG LIu: You don't need four components to be able to transform under Lorentz. You just need a smaller unit, OK? He says this tells you that at least two components already can transform. HONG LIU: If tilde is just some other constant, then you multiply gamma 5. So, here, we can rewrite a little bit differently. We can consider rewrite this alpha L and alpha R in terms of the following. Let's consider the two transformation-- one transformation, psi L, and psi R transform the same. And the other transformation is that they transform oppositely. They transform in the opposite phase, OK? So I write the alpha-- and this writing is like that. HONG LIU: In physics, actually, the massless case actually gives you very much richer structure, normally, than the massive particle. In the Dirac spinor, which we have talked about so far, is four components. And then the chiral spinor we talked about-- essentially, you have two complex components. So the next one I'm going to talk about is the Majorana, in which case, I would argue, we have 4 times 1 real component. B when you act on sigma mu B minus 1. So that gives you minus sigmaMu, nu, star, OK? So this is obvious because sigmamu, nu has i there. And, otherwise, the B takes each gamma matrices there into star. So we have used this trick many times. Yeah, and then so we get a very nice relation that, under Lorentz transformation, again, is generated by this B, related to this B matrix. So B, in this case, can only be gamma 2.

Summary:
The best-case scenario for expansionary fiscal policy is when there are lots of underemployed resources in the economy. By increasing spending, the federal government can try to counteract falling aggregate demand. In one scenario, government spending doesn't have to be as large as the fall in "C," or consumption, to counteract the recession, and that's because of the multiplier effect. But, as always, shifting lines on a graph is much easier than shifting around real resources in a multi-trillion dollar economy.

Sarah thread sterner shows you how to wear and take off a mask. She explains how to determine which part of the mask is the front versus the back. She also shows how to mold the nose piece of the face mask with the finger tips of both hands. Finally, she shows you the best way to remove the mask by placing it over your ears and pulling it under your chin when removing the mask it's important to remember that the front is considered contaminated so remove it with the fingertip and then perform hand hygiene.

Summary:
In this lecture, we're going to talk about how neurons function and how researchers are able to control that function in order to modify behavior. Then we'll talk about synapses and how synapses function to communicate between neurons. And this is going to involve also sort of understanding how certain antidepressants, like Prozac, work. And then we'll end by talking about how researchers did this experiment to wake up the mouse. And it all starts with something that I told you about at the beginning of the semester, which is the plasma membrane. In a resting state, the cell's resting potential is negative 70 millivolts. The cell can lose this polarity and not have a charge differential, or it can flip and be positive on the inside. Stephen suggested opening ion channels. If you open these, it's going to depolarize the cell. Because remember, high on the outside, out here. And so if you open them, positive ions are going to flow in to make this less positive. So what is an action potential? Everyone see how it's a transient potential. optogenetics is an approach to control the activity of a cell with light. In a normal neuron, you need a neurotransmitter to induce depolarization. optogenetics uses a protein discovered from photosynthetic algae that's responsive to light. And if that's expressed specifically in the neurons that you're trying to test, you can then shine a light into the brain of the organism and activate, specifically, this type of neuron. And that allows you to test the function of the neuron in the behavior of an organism.

Summary:
In this problem, we're going to be dealing with a variation of the usual coin-flipping problem. But in this case, the bias itself of the coin is going toBe random. And we're told that the expectation of this bias is some mu and that the variance of the bias isSome sigma squared. And what we'll be asked is find a bunch of different expectations, covariances, and variances. We'll see that this problem gives us some good exercise in a few concepts, a lot of iterated expectations. An art that you learn through more practice. But one good rule of thumb is, when you have kind of a hierarchy or layers of randomness, it's useful to condition on the layer above where that is, in this case, the random bias of the coin itself. Once you condition on that layer above, that makes the next level much simpler. Because you kind of assume that you know what all the previous levels ofrandomness are, and that helps you calculate what the expectation for this current level.
