In today's video i'll show you the importance of de-gassing your bread dough as it's fermenting. No matter how gentle you try to handle your dough you will always de-gas it if only a little bit in today's comparison video we'll make 4 breads they will be made from the same dough but they will all be treated differently. The first one of the four breads will be left alone from the beginning of fermentation until it's baked. The final one will be folded shaped and degassed three times and we won't be fermenting them for the same amount of time. why are you punching it punching is actually quite aggressive and you should never punch your dough the best thing to do is deflate it by pressing it gently as the dough ferments the gas pockets inside the grow larger and larger and the membrane of dough between those pockets can tear. If this process keeps going undisturbed the crumb of the bread can end up with large bubbles surrounded by denser areas of dough this of course not always a bad thing some high hydration breads are specifically made to have that texture.
