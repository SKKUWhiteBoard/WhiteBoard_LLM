hey everyone it's sth register nurse rn.com and in this video we're going to be going over our weekly inlex practice question. Let's see what our question says a patient who has a health history of uncontrolled hypertension coronary artery disease and diabetes militis is prescribed to take propanolol. The question asks which statement by the patient is correct about this medication propano wal that they're Going to be taking. The answer is that the patient should take the medication every morning with grapefruit juice and monitor their blood glucose level closely. look and see why D is wrong this patient says that they're going to stop their beta blocker immediately if they experience cold hands and feet well this is a normal side effect with these non-selective beta blockers. You would never just immediately stop taking a beta blocker they need to be tapered off of this because if they just all of a sudden quit taking that medication they can go have cardiac death or something worse can happen so that answer is wrong for that reason okay so that wraps up this inlex practice question.
