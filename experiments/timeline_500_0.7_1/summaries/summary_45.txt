Marginal rate of substitution of good 1 with respect to good 2 is infinity. When we are increasing the amount of 1 good to bring what will happen using this, if we use the monotonicity. What we are talking about is an indifference curve of a person who exhibit, whose preference exhibits convexity. To get 1 good you will have to give up the other good, both what we are assuming that both these items are good, means they give certain satisfaction or certain you know utility to the person. good 1, how much the other person is willing to give up, the another good, but we have to measure in terms of per unit of good 1. So, that is why in that case MRS is going to be, let us say in other word, let's see if we just do it mathematically, the original bundle is x y. Change is x plus delta x and y plus delta y, and what would be the slope, what we are certain about that.
