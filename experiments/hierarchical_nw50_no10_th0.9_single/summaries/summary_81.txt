Since 1872, hardrock mining on federal lands has been governed by the General Mining Law. The law allows virtually free access to open public domain lands for mineral prospecting, staking claims, exploration and development, and extraction without payment of a royalty. Proposals to reform the Mining Law have been made almost from the time it was signed by President Grant, and throughout its 135 year history. At this writing, the major reform bill in the House is H.R. 2262, which, among other things, would impose an 8% ad-valorem royalty.
