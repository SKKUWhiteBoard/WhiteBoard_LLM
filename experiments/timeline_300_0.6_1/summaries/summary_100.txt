In this problem, we're going to be dealing with a variation of the usual coin-flipping problem. But in this case, the bias itself of the coin is going toBe random. And we're told that the expectation of this bias is some mu and that the variance of the bias isSome sigma squared. And what we'll be asked is find a bunch of different expectations, covariances, and variances. We'll see that this problem gives us some good exercise in a few concepts, a lot of iterated expectations. not equal to j, we also calculated in part B. That's just sigma squared. All right, and now if we compare these two, we'll see that they are proportionally exactly the same. So what do we learn from this problem? Well, we saw that first of all, it's very useful to use law of iterated expectations. But the trick is to figure out what you should condition on. And that's kind of an art that you learn through more practice.
