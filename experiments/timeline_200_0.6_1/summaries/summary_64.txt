King Arthur was thrown a party at Camelot for Christmas. A towering knight riding an emerald steed burst into the room. He proposed a game. The bravest warrior present would attack him with his own axe. If they could strike him down, they would win his powerful weapon. However, the knight would be allowed to return that blow in one year and one day. No man could survive such a strike. Arthur’s nephew, Sir Gawain, took the weapon instead. And with one swift strike, he beheaded the grinning knight. Gawain was told to seek the Green Chapel by the castle's lord and lady. In exchange for their hospitality, the lord made a strange request. Over the next three days, he would go hunting and share his spoils every night. In return, Gawain must give him whatever he’d gained during his day at the castle. On the third day, the lady offered more than just three kisses. She presented a magical sash that would protect Gawain from the Green Knight’s blade. He bowed his head for the deadly blow, and with a massive swing, the Green Knights cut Gawain’S neck.
