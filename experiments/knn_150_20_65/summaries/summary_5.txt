Albert Meyer: Random variables are an absolutely fundamental concept in probability theory. He says in a game called the bigger number game, two teams try to pick the larger number. Meyerer: Team 2 picks one of the pieces of paper and turns it over and looks at the number on it. And then, based on what that number is, they make a decision, stick with the number they have or switch to the other unknown number on the face down piece of paper, he says.
