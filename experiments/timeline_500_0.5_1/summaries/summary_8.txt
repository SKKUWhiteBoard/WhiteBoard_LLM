Lectures focus on advanced applications, where we have covered a good amount of the material in the ideas behind those applications. We will not quiz you on these application lectures, on the final exam, or anything like that. It's more meant to give you more perspective rather than extra study materials for the final. Today's state-of-the-art in Go is that there are computer players better than the best human players. For a game like Tic-Tac-Toe, you will find out that you can force a draw, and that means fully solving the game. But for a gamelike Go, this is actually pretty hard to do, and it's even much harder than chess. autonomous car drive a desert race. It's a time trial type race. There's no other cars that you have to overtake, but you're kind of on your own and try to do it as fast as possible, 150 mils off road. After driving six hours and 53 minutes at an average speed of 90 miles an hour, Stanley is about to become the first vehicle in history to drive 132 miles by itself. After months of tireless effort, there's a lot at stake. The devil is really in the details, in the long tail of special events that can happen when you're driving. You can measure progress by just demo videos, which is one way, and it gives you some kind of feel for what's going on. Another way to measure progress is to see how are these cars doing relative to human drivers. Let's see what else did we not cover yet? I want to spend a little more than two minutes on that, so let's keep it for today. Bye.
