The 105 th Congress held several hearings and introduced many bills to address slamming. Two measures to further strengthen slamming regulations, S. 58 and S. 1084, were introduced in the 106 th Congress, but neither was enacted. No legislation addressing slamming was introduced in either the 107 th or 108 th Congress and none has beenintroduced in the 109 th Congress. Despite existing regulations to prevent such practices and the overall condemnation of such activities, slamming continues to occur with significant frequency, according to the FCC.
