There's 16 possible transitions, including four homopolymers, AA, TT, CC, GG, and 12 transitions of the other dinucleotides. We've got CG islands where the CGs have been protected from methylation, and hence, protected from mutations. These islands will be a variable length and just have an increased concentration of CGs. And then outside are the ocean, which are not protected. They're not involved in transcription, and they mutate. And they are very low in CGs, so you want to know where the island begins and ends. an ocean. And so here's one that's illustrated, this dotted, brown line, where it says probability of a C minus in an ocean. So that would be a transition point going 5-prime to 3-prime, from an island into an ocean, going from an A to a C. Aren't you glad that I picked a dinucleotide to illustrate this? OK, here's a real example. Here's an example where I've cut and pasted a very short sequence with only one ocean on the left and one island on the right. Student: Do you know the basis for thinking that the context for a dinucleotide is either an ocean or an island, in other words, only two states? Why couldn't the context be five states? GEORGE CHURCH: OK. Question. Student: Why can't there be more than two states for the context of a dinoinucleotide? Student: I want to know why there can't be more states for dinosucleotides. George Church: I don't know, but I think there must be. George Church: How do we deal with multisequence alignments? Church: This is using all the power that we developed for the pairwise comparison. This does scale exponentially with k. Church: There are very good for inferring structure or function from sequence without experiments. It's like doing a huge mutagenesis and exploring viable mutants, he says. He says the most non-polynomial calculations, that is to say, in this case, in the case of this band, you could take one of the examples and take it to the next band.
