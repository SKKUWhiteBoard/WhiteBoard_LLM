Thiazide tells us that this medication works in the early part of the distal convoluted tubule that's found within this nephron. This transporter is called the sodium chloride co-transporter and it is considered a cyanide sensitive transporter so hence why this drug works so well. While loop diuretics are a lot more effective than a thiazide diuretic but the thiazid does provide a nice diuresis effect. They're less effective in patients who have a compromised GFR a go merrill ER filtration rate.
