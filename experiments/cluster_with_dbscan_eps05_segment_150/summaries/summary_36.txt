Professor: The plan for today is as follows. We're going to look at this unitary time evolution and calculate this operator u, given the Hamiltonian. Then we will look at the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics. The Schrodinger operators acquire time dependence, which makes the relation between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics more obvious. So we'll discuss that. We'll find the heisenberg equations of motion and solve them for a particular case today. And we'll go through three cases. variables in, it just becomes identical to the Schrodinger Hamiltonian. All right, so that's all for today. I hope to see in office hours in the coming days. Be here Wednesday 12:30, maybe 12:25 would be better, and we'll see you then. [APPLAUSE] We'll be back at 12:50 on Wednesday, and be here at 1:30 on Thursday. Back to Mail Online home. back to the page you came from. of this, you will get H times that thing. So since it's a power series, you'll differentiate the first term, and you'll get the right thing. Then the second term and you will start getting everything that you need. So it's of limited usefulness. In fact, when we will discuss the rotating magnetic fields for magnetic resonance, we will not solve it in this way. We will try to figure out the solution some other way. All right, so that's all for today. I hope to see in office hours in the coming days.
