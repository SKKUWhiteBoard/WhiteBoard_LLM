Future John Green tells you that in a stunning turn of events the 2020 presidential election will be won by - Harry Styles. We’re going to change the constitution to make it possible. Because… that’s how much we love Harry Styles in 2020. The U.S. was facing what turned out to be the 2nd worst economic crises in the past 150 years. The Wall Street Wamboozle, the Financial Fartstorm. And the U.N. Security Council. The Financial Fartstorm that began in late 2008 was a mixture of public and private activities that tilted towards short-term economic thinking, speculation and irresponsible spending. First, there are the Federal Reserve’s policies of keeping interest rates freakishly low in response to the 2001-2002 recession. And this, combined with unscrupulous mortgage lenders, encouraged people to buy houses that they could not afford. Back then you could buy a house with a so-called NINJA loan which sadly this did not involve mutant ninja turtles or pizza. Traditionally, people in this situation can’t borrow hundreds of thousands of dollars, but in the early 2000’s, these loans were giving the benign sounding designation “subprime” All this created a classic housing bubble, which was doomed to burst. With the interest on government Treasury Bills effectively zero, investors had to look elsewhere for better returns. This led to the idea of issuing securities – these bond-like instruments that were backed by mortgages. The thinking was that the interest people paid on their mortgages would supply the underlying value of the security. but the important thing is that when the mortgages turned bad, these securities became toxic assets. When banks stop lending, business can’t function. So the stock market collapsed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping from above 14,000 to around 8,000 which wiped out about $7trillion of shareholder wealth. With it being harder to borrow money, Americans finally cut back on their spending, which resulted in many businesses failing. By mid-2009 more women than men held paying jobs for the first time in American history. Bush administration tried to stop the damage by getting Congress to pass the TARP. TARP was basically a $700 billion bailout for banks like Citigroup and Bank of America. Regular individuals also received tarps, but they had to buy them and they weren't as cool. Most of the banks that received a rescue from the taxpayers didn't help the homeowners facing foreclosure, and despite receiving millions of federal dollars, AIG continued to pay huge bonuses to its top executives. After a decade of Americans spending more than they had, government took over. In 2008 Obama’s election seemed a political watershed and not just because he was the first African American president. He appealed to young people and minorities, and he harnessed the power of social media to communicate with supporters. He appeared to break Republicans’ solid hold on the south, and also raise TONS of money. Also, he was on the cover of US Weekly. You didn’t see Martin Van Buren on thecover of USweekly. What’�s that? It didn”t exist? Of course it existed! he won Virginia, and North Carolina and Florida, and his supporters represented a coalition of African Americans, and Hispanics, white liberals and, especially, young people. “For everywhere we look, there is work to be done. The state of our economy calls for action, bold and swift. And we will act, not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth.” “We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together. We’ll restore science to its rightful place. We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories’ Obama promised to change the culture of Washington. To be fair, he did end the squabbling, it became full blown yelling. He also wanted a foreign policy based on diplomacy, he wanted to reduce inequality and increase access to health care. He wanted to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and, as critics mocked, reverse global warming. That’s a tall order. Some would say not great either. The getting shocked part of my life has come to an end. Hopefully in Crash Course Literature when I get things right I’ll get a puppy and when I getting things wrong I'll get a rainbow! For instance he launched diplomatic outreach to the Muslim world, but a lot of this was more rhetoric than action. He signed into law the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which made it easier for women to sue when they had been systemically underpaid. And speaking of women he appointed two of them to the Supreme Court, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor. He also followed through on his promise to end the war in Iraq, although to be fair the Bush administration had really set him up for success there. Obama has been criticized internationally for backing off his promise to close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. But the Obama administration has deployed far more unmanned drones to kill suspected militants around the world. Despite provoking outrage on the left and the right, Americans generally appear to support the use of drones and extra-legal assassination of accused terrorists. Obama was fortunate to have a Democratic Congress for his first term in office, so he could push through a lot of legislation. In the end, the recovery act cost $787 billion - more than the government had spent on a package of programs ever. The stimulus is estimated to have saved about 3 million jobs, but it also increased the deficit quite a bit. Liberal economists see America’s current 7% unemployment rate as evidence that the stimulus’ Keynesian policies should have gone further. Obamacare aims to reduce the number of Americans without health insurance by making it easier and less expensive for the uninsured to buy it privately. The Affordable Care Act is arguably the most significant piece of social legislation since Medicare. It seeks to move the United States into the ranks of countries with universal health care. government insurance plan and the government will subsidize those who can’t afford insurance. In 2012 the core of the law was upheld by the Supreme Court when they ruled that thiants was a constitutional use of the government’s taxing power. Not one Congressional Republican voted for Obamacare, and many used it to campaign against Democrats in the 2010 mid-term elections. One of these responses was The Tea Party, a reference to the Boston Tea Party and an acronym for Taxed Enough Already. The Tea Party is very concerned that deficits are out of control and that rising government spending is going to ruin America. Bolstered by 80 or so new Tea Party congresspeople, the Republicans took control of the House in 2010 and John Boehner became the Speaker of The House. All these Tea Party freshmen took their mandate to cut taxes and reduce spending very seriously, and that made it difficult for Boehner to compromise with the Obama administration. In fact, the 111th congress was one of the least productive in American history. ceiling. Things that Congress used to be able to hash out back when their business was governing not ideological rigidity. Meanwhile, the economy has slowly added jobs and looks halfway decent at the moment mostly because Europe looks so bad. That qualified questioning yay is about the last word I have to say on American history. We have to ask ourselves again, “What does freedom really mean?” Can you be free when you live in poverty or when you’re one injury away from bankruptcy? Can you being free when the government can go to a secret court to read your text messages? job to protect you not only by having a standing army but also making you wear your seat belt? Those are ultimately ideological questions, but we have to grapple with them in a real practical way. And the great story of American governance is compromise. But that is also often been the tragedy of American Governance. So if you’ve learned anything this year, I hope its been that the American story that we find ourselves in now isn’t entirely novel. And I think we have much to learn from those who came before us, both from their successes and their many, many failures. Crash Course World History has been on the air for two years.
