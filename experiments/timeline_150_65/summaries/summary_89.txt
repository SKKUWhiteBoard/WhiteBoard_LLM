RAFAEL JARAMILLO: Today we're going to discuss the many D's of thermodynamics. The D's indicate exact differentials, which is equal to infinitesimal changes in state variables. In materials thermodynamics, the most common transformations that we talk about are transformations that take place at constant pressure and constant temperature. So of the three D's-- lowercase d, lowercase Greek d, and uppercase Greek D-- this is the first one. Greek D is often the hardest for students to understand when you first encounter it. To illustrate the concept of transformation quantities, it helps to draw state function surfaces. For example, we could have the entropy of phase alpha drawn as a function of temperature and pressure. In material science, our most common independent variables are pressure and temperature, because those are often the easiest for us to regulate in the laboratory. But in thermodynamics, we have many different transformation quantities that we keep track of, and we're illustrating this for entropy. is a function of those independent variables that measures the transformation quantity for the transformation between two different phases. For example, in the case of water, the quantity of water in the solution is the ratio of the water volume to the volume of the solution. For the example, the total water volume is the sum of the volumes of the solutions of the two phases. The total water content is the product of the proportions of the different water volumes.
