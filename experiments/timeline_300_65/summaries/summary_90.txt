In this video I'm going to be going over lung oscilation specifically the sites of where you osculate. We're going to go over some audio clips of normal breath sounds and where you should hear them at CU that's a big thing. We'll also go over abnormal breath sounds. In the next video I'll be performing an assessment on a patient and show you how to listen with your stethoscope to these sides. I'll also give you some landmarks to make your job easier so you'll know what intercostal space correlates with which lobe of the lung. patient's breathing in and breathing out so that's why you're hearing it on inspiration and expiration now it can sound similar to a parac cardial friction rub how do you tell the difference um if you are wanting to know is this the lungs or is this this the heart just listen have the patient hold their breath. If you can still hear that harsh grading sound it's the heart because they're holding their breath their lungs aren't moving so you've rolled out the lungs. That is lung occultation and normal breast sounds versus abnormal breast sounds.
