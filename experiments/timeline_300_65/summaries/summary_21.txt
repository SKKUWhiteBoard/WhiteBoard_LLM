In this problem, we're given a collection of 10 variables, x1 through x10, where each i, xi, is a uniform random variable between 0 and 1. And we'd like to develop a bound on the probability that some of the 10 variables being greater than 7 using different methods. In part A we'll be using the Markov's inequality written here. And in part B, let's see if we can improve the bound we got in part A using the Chebyshev inequality. In part B, we saw that by using the additional information of the variance combined with the Chebyshev Inequality, we can improve upon bound given by Markov's Inequality. Now, in part C, we'll use a somewhat more powerful approach in addition to the Chebyhev inequality, the so-called central limit theorem. We're asked to compute the probability of x greater or equal to 7, where x is the sum of 10 uniform random variables between 0 and 1, so we'll call it xi. that even with 10 variables, the truth is more like this, which says that the distribution of x concentrates very heavily around 5, and hence, the probability of x being greater or equal to 7 could be much smaller than one might expect. That is, x is more likely to be greater than 7 than it is to be less than 7, and so the probability is much lower than one would expect. It is also more likely that x is greater than or less than 5, rather than equal to 6 or 7.
