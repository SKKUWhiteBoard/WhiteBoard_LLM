John Stuart Mill is the principle expositor of neoclassical utilitarianism. The rights-utility synthesis signals that we're looking for an attempt to put together both a commitment to utilitarian efficiency that's grounded in science on the one hand, and respect for individual rights that's grounding in the workmanship ideal on the other hand. At the same time, more or less, there were very important developments in moral philosophy that I just want to alert you to. The doctrine that I'm mentioning here is the doctrine that would come to be called emotivism. same utility even though they're different indifference curves. Prof: You're on the right track, but what's the problem with their crossing? Student: Because you say I-2 has utility of two, I-3.5 has Utility of two-point-five, but at that point where they intersect they both have to have the same utility. If we're saying that we're indifferent among all the things on this curve we can't have it cross because then we're say here, right, two- point-five is preferred to two. which the radical fangs of classical utilitarianism have been ripped out and it is now a doctrine that is very friendly to whatever status quo happens to be generated in a market system. So it ceases to be this radically redistributive doctrine, and in the process imports into utilitarianism a very robust, some would say, hyper-robust doctrine of individual rights. We'll see how that played out in political theory when we come to look at John Stuart Mills' harm principle next Monday.
