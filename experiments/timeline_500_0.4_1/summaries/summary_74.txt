This lesson will first dive into some signal Theory and then move on into things that we're more familiar with things like deconvolutions and using Transformers for next note prediction. The first thing we want to talk about is how can we sample and quantize a continuous time signal. We then go into some geometric signal Theory with Transformers and finally how how we can kind of generate sounds using these. The next thing we're going to kind oftalk about is changing forms. We'll talk about the SARS ADC algorithm and how it's used to convert digital signals to analog. are the original Pachelbel's Canon um as you can see this does deviate a bit but honestly it sounds pretty good. The Transformer model is able to do this next note next sequence prediction pretty pretty well. So yeah there's a a lot to do in this field um a lot of really cool things happening um and yeah I hope you guys learned something about uh about generative audio today and are inspired to kind of give some of these things a try yourself. thank you guys for tuning in have a good one.
