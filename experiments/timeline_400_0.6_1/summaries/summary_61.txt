The size of the ribosome is similar to the size of a rhinovirus. The mature transcript is resistant to exonucleases. The poly-adenine tail of the transcript is structural to protect the ends of that transcript. The transfer RNAs and theribosomes are the molecular players in translation. They play a key role in translation and give you much more proteins than one gene can encode, which is a wonderful way to diversify transcripts and give them different functions. The genetic code, which forms the basis of this entire concept, has some features to it where it does have some degeneracy. But we'll go through the degeneracy, and we'll take a look at the genetic code because it will tell us exactly how the three letter-- the words made of three bases encode everything we need for translation. The ribosomes were discovered a decade later, and that was the work that was awarded a Nobel Prize for. And then, later on, things started to get to the point where you know, these are sort of things you want to get out to.
