The House passed the Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act in October 2011. The Senate introduced the Coal Ash Recycling and Oversight Act of 2012 in August 2012. The bills would have created a framework that states could use to create permit programs for the "management and disposal" of coal combustion residuals (CCRs) The approach to creating state permit programs was largely the same in each bill, says the report. It is difficult to determine in advance how such statutory specifications may be interpreted by each state, it says. Proposed standards for CCR surface impoundments were modeled on the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) regulations in 30 C.F.R. Part 77. House and Senate bills would add to Subtitle D of RCRA a new Section 4011, "Management and Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals" The bills would encourage states to create permit programs according to statutory standards included in the amendment. The proposed standards include criteria EPA deemed necessary to control contaminant leaching and migration.
