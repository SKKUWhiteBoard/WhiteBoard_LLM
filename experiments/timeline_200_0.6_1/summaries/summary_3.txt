In today's video i'll show you the importance of de-gassing your bread dough as it's fermenting. No matter how gentle you try to handle your dough you will always de-gas it if only a little bit in today's comparison video we'll make 4 breads they will be made from the same dough but they will all be treated differently. The first one of the four breads will be left alone from the beginning of fermentation until it's baked. The final one will be folded shaped and degassed three times and we won't be fermenting them for the same amount of time. why are you punching it punching is actually quite aggressive and you should never punch your dough the best thing to do is deflate it by pressing it gently as the dough ferments the gas pockets inside the grow larger and larger and the membrane of dough between those pockets can tear and the pockets of gas can fuse into larger pockets. If this process keeps going undisturbed the crumb of the bread can end up with large bubbles surrounded by denser areas of dough this of course not always a bad thing some high hydration breads are specifically made to have that texture as we punch down or deflate the dough the Gas pockets break down and split up resulting in a more tightly packed and even chrome structure. proof i tried to shape them similarly as i could so that the main difference between these breads would be the steps that we took or skipped now degassing folding and shaping is not just about what the crumb will be like it's also a way of controlling fermentation. After punching your dough down it starts fermenting more rapidly this is because the old built up carbon dioxide actually slows down fermentation so knocking the old gas out makes these ferment more rapidly okay it's time to bake these three and now we can compare the results. worst and you should not be making bread like that if you want to use this method it should be fermented for much longer and perhaps go in a higher tin at the end of the day it's all up to you make your bread the way you like it make it fit your style and taste experiment try different methods don't just follow recipes ask questions and if you ever get stuck check out more videos in the principles of baking playlists you might find some answers there so what do you think of degas thing do you degas your bread though let me know down in the comments and don't forget to read the blog post linked in the video description.
