The dagger algorithm aims to provide a more principled solution to the imitational and distributional Shi problem. The idea in dagger is to actually run the policy in the real world see which states it visits and ask humans to label those States. The goal is to collect data in such a way that P Pi Theta can actually learn from the data it's trained on. The basic version of dagger works like this and that's the version that you will all be implementing in your homework. It's a very simple algorithm to implement if you can get those labels. It can actually get up to fly pretty reliably through a forest dodging trees. copter rotors to make it do some really complex aerobatic trick if you want humans to control all the joints in a complex humanoid robot that might be even harder maybe you need to rig up some really complicated harness for them to wear. If you want to control a giant robotic spider well good luck finding a human who can operate that. When learning autonomously in principle machines can get unlimited data from their own experience and they can continuously self-improve and get better and better in principle exceeding the performance of humans. negatives of one another and the reason that we see both sometimes is the same kind of a cultural distinction that I alluded to before remember I mentioned that we have S a uh which comes from the study of dynamic programming that's where the reward comes from in optimal control it's it's a bit more common to deal with costs in America we are all very optimistic and we think about life as bringing rewards maybe there's something to that but for the purpose of this class don't worry about it C is just the negative R.
