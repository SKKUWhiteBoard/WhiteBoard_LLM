hey everyone it's sth register nurse rn.com and in this video we're going to be going over our weekly inlex practice question. Don't forget to check out the other practice questions in this series. Let's see what our question says a patient who has a health history of uncontrolled hypertension coronary artery disease and diabetes militis is prescribed to take propanolol. You have provided the patient with education about this new medication which statement by the patient indicates your teaching was effective.  beta blockers block your sympathetic nervous nous system. They increase a process called glycogenolysis which is going to increase that blood sugar. If a patient misses a dose of their beta blockers they don't need to double the dose they need to take it as soon as they remember unless unless the next dose is double they're at high risk of a cardiac event. If they're taking a beta blocker that is blocking that response they're not going to have that classic Tac of cardia so they may later on their sugar will drop so much. look and see why D is wrong this patient says that they're going to stop their beta blocker immediately if they experience cold hands and feet well this is a normal side effect with these non-selective beta blockers. You would never just immediately stop taking a beta blocker they need to be tapered off of this because if they just all of a sudden quit taking that medication they can go have cardiac death or something worse can happen so that answer is wrong for that reason okay so that wraps up this inlex practice question.
