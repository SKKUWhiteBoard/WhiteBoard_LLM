This is part 2 of a guide to clinical reasoning or how to create an accurate differential diagnosis from a patient's presentation. In the first part I reviewed a practical five-step bedside approach to Clinical reasoning. In this part I will demonstrate how to use this approach with an actual patient case at the student level. I present this patient to you the same way in turn might present the patient to his or her attending on rounds or to their colleagues during a morning report or teaching conference as I present the case I'll keep a running list of the key features of the presentation so they will seem like I am doing step 1 acquired data. find an anatomic framework works best particularly one which subdivides the abdomen into quadrants or regions in which a disease of a specific organ is listed within the region under which it lies. The epigastrium would obviously be the most critical anatomic region to include organs that physically lie directly underneath it in the stomach pancreas and small bowel diseases of the stomach which caused acute abdominal pain are many but most commonly are gastritis and peptic ulcer disease in the Pancreas.
