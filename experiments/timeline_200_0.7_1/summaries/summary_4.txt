When it was ratified in 1789, the U.S. Constitution provided a way for the people to alter the constitution itself. Of the nearly 11,000 amendments proposed in the centuries since, only 27 have succeeded. For an amendment to even be proposed, it must receive a two-thirds vote of approval in both houses of Congress. To actually change the Constitution, the amendment must be ratified by three-quarters of all states. To do this, each state can either have its legislature vote on the amendment, or it can hold a separate ratification convention. The U.S. hasn't passed an amendment since 1992. The Bill of Rights includes some of America's most well-known freedoms. The first ever proposed amendment was on the verge of ratification in the 1790s. Today, there are many suggested amendments, including outlawing the burning of the flag, limiting congressional terms, or even repealing the Second Amendment. While many enjoy strong support, their likelihood of passing is slim. Americans today are the most politically polarized since the Civil War, making it difficult to pass amendments. nearly impossible to reach a broad consensus. The late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia once calculated that due to America's representative system of government, it could take as little as 2% of the total population to block an amendment. Interestingly, the founders themselves may have foreseen this problem early on. In a letter to James Madison, Thomas Jefferson wrote that laws should expire every 19 years rather than having to be changed or repealed. Although he believed that the basic principles of the Constitution would endure, he stressed that the Earth belongs to the living, and not to the dead.
