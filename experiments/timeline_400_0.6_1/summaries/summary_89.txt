NORVIN RICHARDS: Today is phonetics, which means that today we begin making funny sounds at each other. One standard way of talking about different kinds of speech sounds is to talk about where in the vocal tract the flow of air can get obstructed. So for example, there are what are called bilabial sounds. These are sounds which are made with both lips. And so that's what you do for the sounds that are at the beginnings of words like "paint" and "bath," and "mouth," and well, "wipe" in mind? STUDENT: No. NORVIN RICHARDS: Oh, OK. We'll get to "r," eventually. People investigate this kind of thing in all kinds of ways. These days, people do a lot of MRIs. There are charts of all of the sounds that we're going to talk about plus many more together with MRIs of the insides of people's mouths making these sounds so that you can see the anatomy. You won't just have to think about it.  phonologist: "cat" and "dog" end in sounds that differ in voicing. "z" is voiced and that "s" is voiceless. "v" is more-- there's more air, I guess, than "f" or "v," but it's not the same. If you whisper "safe," and "save," you have the feeling that you can hear the difference between them. "F" is slower, I think my mouth is opening slower, so yes? So yes? English has a very large number of vowels and a not-very-good system for writing them. One way of classifying vowels is in terms of height. For "ee," your tongue is tense. And then for "ooh," where does it go? It moves, right? So you aren't just rounding your lips and leaving your tongue where it was. In fact, that's why when you take photographs of people, you have them say something with an "ee" vowel in it, like "cheese"
