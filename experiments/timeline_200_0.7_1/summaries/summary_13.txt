Ani was a real person, a scribe from the Egyptian city of Thebes who lived in the 13th century BCE. His Book of the Dead was a 78-foot papyrus scroll designed to help him attain immortality. Ani's epic journey begins with his death. His body is mummified by a team of priests who remove every organ except the heart, the seat of emotion, memory, and intelligence. It's then stuffed with a salt called natron and wrapped in resin-soaked linen. The wrappings are woven with charms for protection and topped with a heart scarab amulet. can imagine him happily tending his crops for all eternity. Can't imagine him being happier than when he was tending to his crops. Can imagine him growing his crops all day and all night. Couldn't imagine a better way to spend the rest of his life than in the fields. Can picture him growing crops all night and all day long. Could imagine him tending his crop all day, all night, all day. Could he be happier than he was right now? Could he ever be happier?
