like I said we first started this particular piece talking about it you know that memory if I am dead if I'm gone think back to this time sister if you can't hear my any longer just remember what my feelings are for you. "This is one I probably say the top three or four most difficult pieces not that it's crazy hard but it's just it's a lot more difficult than reading those pulp" "My voice and my spirit will continue because you'll be experiencing all of these things and thinking in the same mind frame that I was thinking" William Wordsworth and Samuel Samuel Taylor Coleridge probably the two of the most influential of this particular era. William Wordsworth just reading about some of this past you know upbringing and how that influences writing. The piece that we'll read today it's heavily influenced by his past. The next piece we read is called The Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Samuel TaylorColeridge. We'll talk about the literary partnership that was that was created between Coleridges and the Mariner.
