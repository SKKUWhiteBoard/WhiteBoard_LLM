Future John Green tells you that in a stunning turn of events the 2020 presidential election will be won by - Harry Styles. We’re going to change the constitution to make it possible. Because… that’s how much we love Harry Styles in 2020. The U.S. was facing what turned out to be the 2nd worst economic crises in the past 150 years. The Wall Street Wamboozle, the Financial Fartstorm. And the U.N. Security Council. Crash Course US History hosts explains what caused the Financial Fartstorm that began in late 2008. It was a mixture of public and private activities that tilted towards short-term economic thinking, speculation and irresponsible spending. The event that triggered the chaos was the failure of the investment bank Lehman Brothers in September, just 2 months before the presidential election. The stock market collapsed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping from above 14,000 to around 8,000 which wiped out about $7trillion of shareholder wealth. With it being harder to borrow money, Americans finally cut back on their spending. job to protect you not only by having a standing army but also making you wear your seat belt? Those are ultimately ideological questions, but we have to grapple with them in a real practical way. And the great story of American governance is compromise. But that is also often been the tragedy ofAmerican governance as when the Constitutional Convention compromised over whether African American people were people. So if you’ve learned anything this year, I hope its been that the American story that we find ourselves in now isn’t entirely novel. And I think we have much to learn from those who came before us.
