The Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act of 1990 was passed in 1990. It requires colleges to publish and distribute an annual security report. The report includes statements about campus law enforcement policies, security education and crime prevention programs, alcohol and drug policies, sexual assault education and prevention programs. Two bills introduced in the 104th Congress would have required more detailed and current campus security records to be made accessible to the public, but no further action was taken before the sessionâ€™s end. In 1996, no guidance for monitoring campus security was available until September 1996.
