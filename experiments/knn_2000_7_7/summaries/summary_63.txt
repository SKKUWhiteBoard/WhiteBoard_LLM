If certain amount of output can be produced by given amount of inputs, then the same combination of input puts can also be used to produce less. The key word is feasibility technology. So, if it is feasible to produce half kg of curd from 1 kg of milk, then it is possible to produce 250 grams of curD from 1kg of milk. The second is no free lunch. At least 1 input is required to produce some output, or more than you know more than 1 kind of output. Third is non reversibility, what it means is that a production process cannot be reversed.
