Of the nearly 11,000 amendments proposed in the centuries since, only 27 have succeeded as of 2016. To actually change the Constitution, the amendment must be ratified by three-quarters of all states. Most other democracies pass amendments every couple of years, but the U.S. hasn't passed one since 1992. Ratifying amendments has also become harder as the country has grown larger and more diverse. Americans today are the most politically polarized since the Civil War, making it harder to pass amendments. nearly impossible to reach a broad consensus. The late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia once calculated that due to America's representative system of government, it could take as little as 2% of the total population to block an amendment. Interestingly, the founders themselves may have foreseen this problem early on. In a letter to James Madison, Thomas Jefferson wrote that laws should expire every 19 years rather than having to be changed or repealed. Although he believed that the basic principles of the Constitution would endure, he stressed that the Earth belongs to the living, and not to the dead.
