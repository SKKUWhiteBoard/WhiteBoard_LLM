Using TRLs we developed for these technologies, we found consensus among stakeholders that CCS is less mature than efficiency technologies. Commercial deployment of CCS within 10 to 15 years is possible according to DOE and other stakeholders. Many technologies to improve plant efficiency have been used and are available for commercial use now, but still face challenges. injection wells can be permitted as Class Iinjections of hazardous wastes, including industrial nonhazardous wastes, municipal wastewater. The lack of such benchmarks or an assessment of the maturity of key coal technologies and whether they are achieving planned or desired results limits.
