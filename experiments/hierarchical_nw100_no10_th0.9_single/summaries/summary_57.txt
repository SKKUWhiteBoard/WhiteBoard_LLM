In the 1800s, the private sector played a central role in financing early transportation infrastructure development in the United States. Conventional transit projects generally follow a ‘design-bid-build’ approach. More recently, there has been a move back towards policies that encourage more private and public blending of funding, responsibility, and control in transportation projects. Much of the federal government’s share of new capital investment in mass transportation has come through FTA’S New Starts program, which identifies and recommends new fixed-guideway transit projects.
