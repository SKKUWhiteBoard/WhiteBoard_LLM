In this problem, we are given a joint PDF for x and y. And then we are asked to compute the variance of x plus y. You can think of x as a new random variable whose variance we want to compute. And moreover, we're told we should compute this variance by using something called the law of total variance. So this really can seem quite intimidating, because we have nested variances and expectations going on, but we'll just take it slowly step by step. And now we can look at this conditional PDF to figure out what this is. if you fix an arbitrary x in the interval, 0 to 1, we're restricting ourselves to this universe. So y can only vary between this point and this point. In the unconditional universe, x and y were uniformly distributed. So it follows that in the conditional universe, y should also be uniformly distributed, because conditioning doesn't change the relative frequency of outcomes. So that reasoning means that we can draw the conditional PDF of y conditioned on x as this. We said it varies between x and x plus 1. And we also said that it's uniform, which means that it must have a height of 1.
