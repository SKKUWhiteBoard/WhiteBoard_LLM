We've seen that the velocity can be written as r d theta dt. In the theta hat direction, theta is increasing. And so the particle is traveling around the circle in this direction. Let's now look at rotation in an arbitrary plane. So if I have a plane like this and I have some particle traveling in a circle like this, then it will see this rotation. And I have an observer that's above the plane looking down on this plane, then I will see it. as being in the counterclockwise direction. Whereas if I have another observer down here and they're looking up at this plane, they'll see the motion as being clock wise. And so you can see we have a need for a more formal definition for the rotation of this. So what we're going to do is use the right hand rule to define a direction that tells you both the direction it defines the plane and it also tells you what the positive direction of rotation is for that plane. it's the normal unit vector to that plane. So in the case of d theta dt positive, our circle looks something like this. And you can see that if I use my right hand rule, the plane, the vector that I've defined, is out of the board. In our other case, for d thea dt less than zero, our particle is traveling in this direction. And for that, I'm going to draw this as an x in the circle. So these are symbols that you'll see throughout the rest of the course.
