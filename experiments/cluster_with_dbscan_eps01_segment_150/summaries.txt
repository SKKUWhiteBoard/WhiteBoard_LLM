such that the limit as k goes to infinity of x sub n sub k equals liminf of xsub n. And again, this is a subsequence of a convergent sequence, so it's convergent and convergence of the same thing, L. So that implies that this thing is equal to L. And therefore, the limsup and the liminf equal each other, and they also equal the limit of the original sequence. That is the end of the proof of this theorem. CASEY RODRIGUEZ: We proved two theorems last time, and we used them for-- and we had a couple of applications of them. He says we can define a positive real number to a rational power using elementary facts about the real numbers. Roddiguez: You don't need the exponential and the logarithm to make sense of a real number of power. But we're just going to use the basic properties of exponents throughout all this so we don't use derivatives.

You live in this and dwell in lover's eyes. May your day be filled with love and poetry. Whatever state you're in, we will always love you. Signed, Jack Florian, James [INAUDIBLE]. [LAUGHTER] PROFESSOR: Thank you, sir. The configuration of a particle is given by, or described by, a wave function psi of x. In 3D, the wave function would be a function of all three positions x, y and z. If there are two possible configurations the system can be in, it's possible to find the system in a superposition of those two psi is equal to some arbitrary linear combination alpha psi 1 plus beta psi 2 of X. The superposition principle is an important challenge for us in the next couple of lectures.

the government. So, this is a concept, an extreme concept that we typically do not find, but you would see in newspapers talk about moving towards laissez faire or moving away from laissezes faire. The government. is not a government, it is a body that has the power to decide what happens to people's lives. The. government is not the government. It is a group of people who have the power. to make decisions about people’s lives. It has the ability to make changes to the law. When you do not have unlimited amount of everything, you will have to make a choice, what to produce? In what quantity you should produce a particular good. Allocation is nothing but assignment, allotment, share, but in economics we are more technical about this particular term allocation. So, allocation here means solving these three fundamental or basic questions of economics, and the first question is what to produced? The second is how to produce and the third is for whom to produce. And depending on who makes these decisions we have different form of economy, who make these decisions.

This little game has a whole bunch of random variables appearing in it. And in the next segment, we will look again officially, what is the definition of a random variable? We will also look again at the concept of "randomness" in the game of cards and dice. Albert Meyer: Random variables are an absolutely fundamental concept in probability theory. He says in a game called the bigger number game, two teams try to pick the larger number. Meyerer: Team 2 picks one of the pieces of paper and turns it over and looks at the number on it. And then, based on what that number is, they make a decision, stick with the number they have or switch to the other unknown number on the face down piece of paper, he says.

You want to drastically reduce the number of computations that you want to do yep that is basically everything for today thank you guys for coming oh and there will also be a quiz. I want to start by sort of recapping what we talked about last Tuesday um I apologize that was kind of a rough introduction that was uh that was me making a couple of last minute edits that probably hurt more than they helped so I want to just review um convolutions and and the architecture of a CNN to make this more clear and put it into perspective how it relates to um just standard um dense neural networks I think it's fine. When you have images and a CNN you can simply just do convolutions instead of your normal matrix multiplication um which is demonstrated up here.

The third one will be made with a brief mint which will be left for 12 hours to ferment then it'll be mixed into the main dough. The breads will then take the same amount of time to make but why would you add the extra step of making a briefment when cold fermenting?

We're going to return to this when we reach the conclusion of the Deuteronomistic history in 2 Kings. It would be interesting to see how they would have reacted to the events of the time in which they were living. Christine Hayes: God's choice of Israel as the chosen one occurs for the first time in the Book of Deuteronomy. She says it is by no special virtue or merit that Israel was the one chosen. Hayes: The privilege of having been chosen or singled out entails obligations and responsibility. Deuteronomistic historian in general will get to the idea of God's providential concern for Israel, she says. in a moment we will see how important that is, or in a few lectures,how important that idea is for the Deuteronomic historian ingeneral.

Bogdan Fedeles: Today we're going to be talking about Problem 2 of Problem Set 4. We'll be discussing in detail the mechanism of HMG-CoA synthase, a key enzyme in central metabolism. The enzyme is responsible for making the five carbon building blocks from which all sterols, such as cholesterol and steroid hormones, are made. The reaction will start by forming this thioester between the acetoacetyl- CoA carbons and the cysteine in the active site of the enzyme.

He says there are some very deep differences between the kind of information you find when you're talking about the genotype, and when we'retalking about phenotypes. He says each one has its own specific nature and function, and needs to be treated with different tools.

We'd like to hear from you. The dagger algorithm aims to provide a more principled solution to the imitational and distributional Shi problem. The idea in dagger is to actually run the policy in the real world see which states it visits and ask humans to label those States. The goal is to collect data in such a way that P Pi Theta can actually learn from the data it's trained on. The basic version of dagger works like this and that's the version that you will all be implementing in your homework. It's a very simple algorithm to implement if you can get those labels. It can actually get up to fly pretty reliably through a forest dodging trees.

The sa node is really the starting point of the electrical conduction system. If this process is occurring like it should it should cause this heart to beat at about 60 to 100 beats per minute on the ecg. On the flip side let's say that this sa nodes is disease it's causing the heart to beating slowly.

Summary:
that even with 10 variables, the truth is more like this, which says that the distribution of x concentrates very heavily around 5, and hence, the probability of x being greater or equal to 7 could be much smaller than one might expect. That is, x is more likely to be greater than 7 than it is to be less than 7, and so the probability is much lower than one would expect. It is also more likely that x is greater than or less than 5, rather than equal to 6 or 7. In this problem, we're given a collection of 10 variables, x1 through x10, where each i, xi, is a uniform random variable between 0 and 1. And we'd like to develop a bound on the probability that some of the 10 variables being greater than 7 using different methods. In part A we'll be using the Markov's inequality written here. And in part B, we'll use the Chebyshev inequality, which takes into account the variance of random variable x.

the string, too, were massless. So we have simply mp plus mw a. And so we can now solve for the tension in the string, which is equal to mp plusmw times g plus a divided by 3. And recall that this tension, that the string is pulling, this is what we called the force that the person [? of ?] the string on the person. And by Newton's third law, that's also, on the washer, that’s also the force. So now that we've combined pulley A, string 2, platform, and washer as our system, we can now address our question. If we measure the acceleration of the person, what is the force that the person pulls the rope down with? Well, of course, that will just be the tension in the string. And with this simple system,we can now apply Newton's second law, F equals ma. And so by thinking about how to choose a system, what could be a very complicated problem, with lots of equations, is simply one equation.

and do the same chemistry, but they have different metal cofactors depending on where they evolved. The function in all cases is to generate a radical in the active site and then the chemistry is the same in all these things. And the function of the metalcofactors in all case is to create a radical, which is the key to the chemistry in all of these cases, says Dr. Michael Bociurkiw, a professor of chemistry at the University of California, San Diego. Joanne Stubbe's lab works on the only cool enzyme in the world-- ribonucleotide reductase. It's the only way in all organisms that you make the building blocks de novo that are required for DNA biosynthesis and repair. If you inhibit this enzyme, you have no building blocks. You can't survive. So from a practical point of view, it's the target of drugs they use therapeutically in the treatment of cancer. And I think in probably not so distant future in the antibacterials because there are sufficient differences between humans and bacteria reductases.

Ambiguity or not it's kind of if the uncertainty lips of speakers need to seen all that area to make this is no that's the only place where I actually can match and about the special clustering technique for the original paper where you find all the information here's the work back in also recognizing places using spectral clustered local matches. This is exactly the approach that I presented here and actually a couple of the slides that I use in here or of the images material at least comes from a tin Olsen. okay so welcome to the last lecture of this course here in this winter term and what we discussed so far in the course were mainly the so-called backends or optimization engines or probablistic estimation techniques. Today I would like to give a very very of course brief short overview about front ends and one important aspect inside successful front ends on how to determine if a constraint is likely to be a correct one so we are still interested in avoiding to add roam constraints although we've learned that we there are techniques which can deal with outliers in the data Association.

is that going to cost a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to do more intercept in multiple cities and get approximately 1500 respondents now when we do focus groups we also do multiple rounds of focus groups because each round is iterative so we learn from the first round of focus group and then we incorporate that in the next round before we do the quantitative research. i recommend that do the focus groups then we're going to do quantitative research before that now both of those focus groups and questionnaires qualitative and quantitative research as i describe that. Marketing is about four things creating communicating delivering and exchanging value. Value is a function of price quality and benefits so let's make sure that we don't think that value means low price. For something to be of a good value it doesn't need to be a low price it could be a high price but it's a very high quality and it has a lot of benefits do you agree who could explain that further good tell us your name theresa bad um i mean would you consider that clothing yes.

classical to what we're going to all neoclassical utilitarianism is a subject with which I will begin on Wednesday. See you then for the next installment of this week's Daily Discussion, which will focus on the role of utilitarianism in the development of the modern world. Back to Mail Online home. back to the page you came from. Click here to read the first installment of the Daily Discussion. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion and @jennifer_newton. Bentham's principle is "the greatest happiness of the greatest number" He thinks all utility is quantifiable and expressible through money. He also has a doctrine of revealed preference, where we can vary the price to get information about your utility. Bentham allows interpersonal comparisons of utility, so we can say that if you take one unit of utility from one person and give it to another person, you can make comparisons across individuals that we can make across society. And we could even influence your behavior without actually changing your preferences, and that's a very important distinction.

Either the collagen fails to form properly, or the collagen, when it forms, it has much less mechanical stability. So I think that's a good place to stop and I'll pick up next time with hemoglobin. There's a great link on the website to the Protein Data Bank to see how enzymes work. These slides are posted with these reading assignments, and they're posted in color if you want to look at them again. Lipids are mostly hydrophobic, which can also be referred to as lipophilic. In those fatty acids, they could be fully saturated. This is a very important semi-permeable membranes are made up through the non-covalent, supramolecular association of phospholipid monomer units. If they were fully permeable, anything could come and go and they wouldn't be much use frankly. But because they're semi- permeable, only a few things can come and going without extra help.

If you have a gradient of a magnetic field, then one end a dipole-- one end of your magnet-- can feel a stronger effective torque then the other guy. So, you can get a net force. And that force is going to be proportional to how big your magnet is. And if the force is proportional to the strength ofyour magnet, then how far-- if you send this magnet through a region, it'll get deflected in one direction or the other.

Sometimes this definition of best might work. Sometimes no definition ofbest will work. You can't get to an optimal solution with a greedy algorithm. On Wednesday, we'll talk about how do you actually guarantee finding an optimal Solution in a better way than brute force. John Guttag: The 60002 course is less about programming and more about dipping your toe into the exotic world of data science. The main topic of the course is what I think of as computational models. We'll talk about three kinds of models-- optimization, statistical models, and simulation. An optimization model is a very simple function that can help us to either understand something that has happened, or to build a model that explains phenomena we see every day. The final exam will be a final exam based upon all of the above.

was expansionary. That was contractionary. But it was overwhelmed or offset, more than offset by the improvement in the outlook that you had. And that also happens with monetary policy. Countries that have high inflation problems and so on sometimes get-- and they have to go through dramatic tightenings. Yes, most of them get very short-lived recession. But sometimes they are veryshort-lived recessions because eventually the reduction of the instability caused by high and unstable inflation sort of ends up dominating any direct contractionary effect. Expectations play a big role in the decision of all economic actors. Milton Friedman called it the permanent income theory of consumption. You don't want to be moving consumption up and down like crazy. Once you realize, more or less, what you'll get on average, then you should-- consumption should be related to that concept. We will develop a life-cycle theory of Consumption, which says, look, even at the level of an individual, the day-to-day income is not really what determines consumption.

CNN's John Defterios takes a look at three different views of fiscal policy. Keynesian, classical and supply-side views are shown in the atas model. The Keynesian view is based on the idea that if you borrow money and make aggregate demand increase, eventually it will increase. The supply side view is more of a Keynesian approach and focuses on what happens when aggregate demand is increased rather than how much it increases. Defterius: We have three main views of how well fiscal policy works or how well it doesn't work and we're just gonna look at these.

We're going to look at this unitary time evolution and calculate this operator u, given the Hamiltonian. Then we will look at the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics. The Schrodinger operators acquire time dependence, which makes the relation between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics more obvious. So we'll discuss that. We'll find the heisenberg equations of motion and solve them for a particular case today. And we'll go through three cases.

So I didn't have time to explain this figure, which I think probably would be useful as a high level summary of what's happening. Like this is the forward path. This is how you define network and the loss function. So you start with some example x, and then you have some-- I guess, this is a matrix vector multiplication module, and you take x inner product multiplied with w and b. And then get some activation, the pre-activation. And you get some post activation.

how would I have sounded?" We can never be sure how things could've unfolded if different people were in power or different decisions were made, but to avoid the mistakes of the past, we must always be willing to put historical figures on trial. We must never forget that history is not an exact copy of the present, but it can be a guide to the future. It can be used to learn from the mistakes made in the past and to make better decisions in the present. It is never too late to put a historical figure on trial for their actions. Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, AKA Lenin, helped overthrow the Russian tsar Nicholas II in 1917. He founded the Soviet Union, one of the worst dictatorships of the 20th century. But was he a hero who toppled an oppressive tyranny or a villain who replaced it with another? It's time to put Lenin on the stand in History vs. Lenin, says Alexander Nekrassov, the author of the novel "The Death and Life of Vladimir Lenin"

Everything you need to know about atoms, you can tell a computer, and it can do it. Now molecules are much more complicated. And that's we're going to start on next time. We'll start with molecular orbital theory. I'm not going to be presenting the normal textbook approach. I'll present an interpretive approach, where you understand why things happen. The goal of this course is to give you the tools to interpret complicated phenomena. We have electronic structure and the hydrogen atom as a way of understanding what electronic structure is. When we go to molecular orbital theory, we take what we know about atoms, and build a minimally-complex interpretive picture, which is sort of a framework for understanding complicated molecular interactions. The relationship between the effective quantum number and the ionization energy of a state then provides a hydrogen-atom-based structural model for everything you can observe.

assume that the input are linearly separable, then there is a proof for this. And there are a bunch of other cases where you can have some partial results. Next week, in the next lecture, maybe the second half of next lecture,. I'm also going to give another result, which is somewhat more general. It applies to many different architectures, but it has other kind of constraints. First of all, it doesn't really show exactly these kind of landscape properties. It shows that these kinds of properties holds for a region, for a special region in the parameter space. Last time we talked about some of the kind of the bigger questions in deep learning theory. And today, we are going to start talking about the optimization perspective in deeplearning for two lectures. The main focus is to analyze what the functions you are optimizing look like so that you can use some trivial or some standard optimization algorithm for it. The bigger question we are trying to address here is that why many optimization algorithm are designed for convex functions. But why they can still work for nonconvex functions?

We're told we should compute this variance by using something called the law of total variance. So first, I want to focus on this term-- the conditional expectation of X plus y conditioned on x. So this is actually just x plus the expectation of y given x. And because it's uniformly distributed and because expectation acts like center of mass, we know that the expectation should be the midpoint.

Charles Brockden Brown: The Enlightenment is a critique of a kind of impoverished view of mind or consciousness that over-relies on reason. We started to look at it a little bit with Barlow's [assumed spelling] Raven poem with Poe. The idea that in fact there is something wrong with reason as a faculty, and this can take a couple of forms. One is that all of those nice ideals that come along with the enlightenment may in fact be parasitic precisely on the kinds of negative types of thinking that they are designed to get rid of.

And one has to question the assumptions, understand the assumptions when then go into measurements. So this is the first part of this chapter where we talk about tests. We will have a discussion of implications of special relativity as we move on from here. Markus Klute: We're starting a new chapter in which we look at tests and implications of special relativity. One experimental test is stellar aberration, which we discussed can be explained by special relativity and by velocity addition. In all of this experimentation and experimental verification, it's important to understand the importance of uncertainties in the scientific process overall, Klute says. He says one needs to be open minded and scientifically open minded to study and grow to the question of whether or not Einstein's theory is correct.

In the colonial era, most American women of European descent lived lives much like those of their European counterparts: They were legally and socially subservient to men. Lower and working class women were actually more equal to men of their own classes, but only because they were, like, equally poor. As production shifted from homes to factories, it shifted away from women doing the producing. This led to the so-called “cult of domesticity,” which like most cults, I am opposed to.

That was when I was 1 to 20. I'm 22 now. I've still got a long way to go, but that's a good thing. I still have a lot to learn. I don't think i've learned all of my lessons yet, but I'm getting there. ae houseman 998-999 uh very intellectual individual um with these two authors today um we're really kind of bridging the gap between the victorian and the modern. Most of his poetry especially towards the end if you look on the right there the grief and poetry era. The death of his mother was pretty traumatic um if you've noticed some of the you know most famous musicians you know a lot of their work comes from some of their pain and torment and struggle that they've had throughout their lives.

the same connection. The pion here is spin 0, and if you discuss this in the rest frame of the pion, the electron and the positron fly off in opposite directions, which means that the spin doesn't in align to 0. So that's why this is highly suppressed. It's not 0, because you can find-- you can put [INAUDIBLE] into a rest frame, where you're just basically looking at both particles from one side that was coming to you, and in that case, it's allowed. In quantum mechanics, the spin of a particle with a vector is quantized. You find that it's square root of f times s plus 1 in units of h-bar. If you want to get an eigenvalue with the physical state of particles, which axis are the right ones to choose-- or, sensible? There's no right and wrong in this discussion. It's not 0, because you can put [INAUDIBLE] into the rest frame, where you're just basically looking at both particles from one side.

poll, all examples of how the democratic principle behind sortition still survives today. Polls show that the principle of sortition is still very much alive and well in the United States today. The majority of Americans support sortition, with the majority of people in the U.S. voting in favor of it by a wide margin in the last presidential election in 2008. The most popular type of vote in the 2008 election was for the Democratic Party, followed by the Republican Party and the Libertarian Party. The Democratic Party won the popular vote. In the 5th Century BC Athens was a direct democracy that encouraged wide participation through the principle of ho boulomenos, or anyone who wishes. This meant that any of its approximately 30,000 eligible citizens could attend the ecclesia, a general assembly meeting several times a month. Some ancient philosophers, including Plato, disparaged this form of democracy as being anarchic and run by fools. Could reviving election by lottery lead to more effective government through a more diverse and representative group of legislatures?

sample the signal in the time domain and then add a bunch of zeros to it before you Fourier transform. And that gives you finer samples in the frequency domain. And I'll show you in more detail how to do this after we talk about tapering. And it's very simple code actually. Matlab has built into it the ability to do zero-padding right in the FFT function. OK, let's actually just stop there. I feel like we covered a lot of stuff today. Last time, we covered Fourier series and the Fourier transform. Today, we're going to talk about the convolution theorem, noise and filtering Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem and spectral estimation. Next, we'll move on to spectrograms and an important idea of windowing and tapering, time bandwidth product, and some more advanced filtering methods. And we'll end with a look at a square wave that we've been talking about, the square wave is symmetric or even.

level problem sets. Developing a command of mechanics is a powerful tool for understanding the world around us. Welcome to 8.01, the latest version of the Java programming language. We hope to see you in the next edition of Java 8, which is scheduled to be released later this year. For more information, visit the official Java 8 website or follow us on Twitter at @joshjenson and @jenniferjenson. For the latest Java 8 news, visit our news page. The science of classical mechanics establishes an important principle of cause and effect. Newton's Laws of Motion established the scientific principle of analyzing observed phenomenon through the use of clearly articulated mathematical models rather than through intuition. Developing a command of mechanics is a powerful tool for understanding the world around us. 8.01 assumes a strong background in high school level physics and mathematics, so a previous course in calculus is not a prerequisite. It is a rigorous and technically challenging course aimed at MIT undergraduates. In each of these lessons, you will find a series of short lightboard videos that will help you understand concepts.

minus 1 minus 1 over r times n. And this quantity here equals to r. So there's a strict equality sign here. In particular, G has a clique of size strictly greater than r, and that finishes the proof of Turan's theorem. Turan’s theorem is a important and foundational result in graph theory. And it's a start of a subject that we now call extremal graph theory, concerning what can you say about a graph that has certain properties, like not having a large clique? In this video, we'll look at an application of the probabilistic method to graph theory. An independent set in a graph is a subset of vertices with no two adjacent. Caro-Wei's theorem says that every graph G contains a large independent set of size at least the following quantity: summing over all v among vertices G, 1 over the degree of v plus 1. We'll see an application and some ways to interpret this result in graph theory as well as the corollary of Turan's theorem.

feasible here, y is taking care of not only inputs but also output. The combination is all given here and this exhibits convexity. This is a simple example of how to make a complex shape. The shape can be any shape at any time. It can be either a shape or a shape-shift shape. It is possible to combine two shapes to create a shape that looks like a shape shape. For example, the shape could look like the shape of a circle or a circle. If certain amount of output can be produced by given amount of inputs, then the same combination of input puts can also be used to produce less. The key word is feasibility technology. So, if it is feasible to produce half kg of curd from 1 kg of milk, then it is possible to produce 250 grams of curD from 1kg of milk. The second is no free lunch. At least 1 input is required to produce some output, or more than you know more than 1 kind of output. Third is non reversibility, what it means is that a production process cannot be reversed.

The Great Wall began as multiple walls of rammed earth built by individual feudal states during the Chunqiu period to protect against nomadic raiders north of China. Under the Han Dynasty, the wall grew longer still, reaching 3700 miles, and spanning from Dunhuang to the Bohai Sea. The wall was formidable but not invincible. Both Genghis and his son Khublai Khan managed to surmount the wall during the Mongol invasion of the 13th Century. After the Ming dynasty gained control in 1368, they began to refortify and further consolidate the wall using bricks and stones.

 vector, we have delta x over delta t i hat. And this component here is what we call the component of the average velocity. And, again as before, this component can be positive, zero, or negative depending on the sine of delta x. And the key point here is that average velocity depends on whatever time interval you're referring to. So that's our definition of average Velocity. And now what we want to do is consider what happens in the limit as delta t becomes smaller and smaller. And that will enable us to introduce our concept of instantaneous velocity. The average velocity depends on the time interval t to t plus delta t while the person has displaced a certain amount of vector delta r. So, as a vector, we have delta x over delta t i hat. This component here is what we call the component of the average velocity. And, again as before, this component can be positive, zero, or negative depending on the sine of delta x. And now what we want to do is consider what happens in the limit as delta t becomes smaller and smaller. And that will enable us to introduce our concept of instantaneous velocity.

And we'll find cases where, depending on in what order you combine things, you get different meanings, and our tests will combine with that. All right. We will do this again on Tuesday. "Apparently This Matters" is CNN Radio's weekly, offbeat look at stories you saw on CNN.com. This week, Jarrett ponders the meaning of the word "unlockable" "Unlockable," means either it's possible to unlock it, or it is not possible to lock it," Jarrett says. "Un-" combines with verbs and makes adjectives that mean more or less "not (adjective) " " Unfortunate" means not the adjective, whatever it is.

And if anybody has an idea, a fun idea, for a class project, I'd invite you to give a pitch up here at the front of class, or you're welcome to send it on an email to the class listserv. The goal is to understand solar cell conversion efficiency, which is the ratio of output to input energy. For most solar cells, this breaks down to the following progression, from the solar spectrum to charge collection. We're going to be focusing on charge separation, incorporating elements of either side. The total system efficiency is the product of each individual component going on in a solar cell.

In the year 2000, four-year college grads actually earned more with their entry jobs than they're earning today. Changing technology has made wages rise more at the top, but has held wages down for a lot of other jobs. A third set of factors has to do with slower economic growth, slower productivity growth and slower dynamism in the U.S. economy, says Tyler Cowen. He says there is less demand for new labor and that makes it harder for a new college graduate to get the job he or she wants.

All the bundles here are preferred over the original two bundles, why because here at this point utility is increasing in this direction. So, it is convex. Convexity is satisfied, continuity is satisfied. rationality axioms are satisfied. What is not satisfied here is monotonicity or local non-satiation is satisfied everywhere except at this bliss point, is it clear? So, now, what we will do we will start talking about mathematical problems, optimization, and all. So, the first we learned rationality, rationality axioms - completeness, reflexivity and transitivity. And when our when someone’s preference exhibit these three properties, what does it mean that he is able to completely rank all his choices all his potential choices, with also possibility, with possibility that there are more than one bundle at some ranks this is a possibility. One thing also I should add that he will be able to rank only if he has finite consumption set and also what we have learned that this will translate into a utility function. So, from here we learned that indifference curve has to be downward sloping.

compute the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices, something like this picture, except you don't know what it looks like in 3D. You know every edge must be a shortest path. So the edges are some subset of these guys. And so you've got lots of little convex polygons here. We know it must make a convex polyhedron. If it made two, Cauchy's rigidity theorem would tell you that they're the same. So even once you fix the gluing, you know that there's a unique convex realization. If you have a complex polyhedron, we found general unfoldings. We proved one of them. If you want an edge unfolding, that's the centuries-old open problem. For non-convex polyhedra, we know this is too much to hope for. But for general unfolding, we don't know. So today's lecture is actually mostly about these two open problems and different variations of it that we know how to solve, special cases, and changes in the model.

dt. So when a particle's undergoing circular motion, it has a velocity that you can describe, which is the tangential motion around the circle. And it also has an angular velocity, which we define as being in a direction that's perpendicular to that direction of rotation. And so this is another way that we can write the velocity and connect it back to the angular velocity. And now that we have defined this omega z, the component of the angular Velocity, we can rewrite the velocity as just being equal to r times omega z still in that theta hat direction. For a particle traveling in a circle, we've seen that the velocity can be written as r d theta dt. Let's now look at rotation in an arbitrary plane. And so what we're going to do is use the right hand rule to define a direction that tells you both the direction it defines the plane and it also tells you what the positive direction of rotation is for that plane. Now, in the k hat direction, in this case, I'm going to call it in the arbitrary n hat direction.

And that's proven to be a very effective way of getting more information from the source sentence more flexibly to allow us to generate a good translation. I'll stop here for now and at the start of next time. I will finish this off by going through the actual equations for how attention works. In week four, we take a break from learning more and more on neural network topics, and talk about final projects, but also some practical tips for building neural network systems. Today's lecture is the primary content for what you'll be using for building your assignment 4 systems. In the early 1950s, there started to be work on machine translation. Claims were made that the computer would replace most human translators. When you go in for full scale production what will the capacity be? We should be able to do about with a modern commercial computer about one to two million words an hour.

Of the many myths explaining these animal signs and their arrangement, the most enduring one is that of the Great Race. The first twelve animals to make it across the river would earn a spot on the zodiac calendar in the order they arrived. Each year is associated with one of the animals in this order, with the cycle starting over every 60 years.

this is what we want to discuss on Wednesday. And this is what I referred to as the fundamental limit of spontaneous emission because we have not lost any coherence here. It's just if the phase is only imprinted in one particle-- one particle quantum physics sets us a limitation. Oh well, we can read out the phase phi. OK. Any question? To be continued on Monday. Back to Mail Online home. back to the page you came from. Click here to read the full interview. Professor: In almost all cases when you address atoms, you do two photon courses because a photon is scattered. In reality, it is a two photon process and not two single photon processes, he says. Professor: If you have any doubts about some subtleties about how is light absorbed and emitted, the correct answer is always obtained from the two-photon picture. He then asks the audience to guess how many terms you would expect when you do the most basic light atom interaction.

is really great for research. If you're interested in production deployment, you should probably look at Caffe, Caffe 2 or TensorFlow. PyTorch is a great choice. But it's a bit newer, has less community support, less code out there, so it could be a bit of an adventure. So it's kind of unfortunately, there's not just like one global best framework, it kind of depends on what you're actually trying to do, what applications you anticipate. - Hello? Okay, it's after 12, so I want to get started. So today, lecture eight, we're going to talk about deep learning software. This is a super exciting topic because it changes a lot every year. But also means it's a lot of work to give this lecture. But as usual, a couple administrative notes before we dive into the material. So as a reminder the project proposals for your course projects were due on Tuesday. And again, when working on assignment two, remember to stop your Google Cloud instances.

the results for "bad" using cosine distance in cell 12 and Jaccarddistance in cell 13. And I would just like to say that these neighbors don't look especially intuitive to me. It does not look like this analysis is revealing really interesting semantic information. But don't worry, we're going to correct this. We're going. to start to massage and stretch and bend our vector space models. And we will see much better results for these neighbor functions and everything else as we go through that material. Part 3 in our series on distributed word representations. We're going to be talking about vector comparison methods. To try to make this discussion pretty intuitive, I'm going to ground things in this running example. On the left, I have a very small vector space model. We have three words, A, B, and C. And you can see graphically that B and C are pretty close together. And A is kind of lonely down here in the corner, the infrequent one.

It's very simple to understand" liyan blake a little bit about him he's kind of out there some of his contemporaries thought he was insane you know nowadays maybe he would be heavily medicated. People think that he's out there and there was that who was William Wordsworth who said that there is something in the madness of this man which interests me more than the sanity of Lord Byron and Walter Scott. He was an individual who you know was into art and was into eventually you know religion and such became a big part of his life but his as an artist he was also big-time into painting.

broken heart, leaving behind a land that would remain ravaged by Meadhbh’s war for years to come. “I will never forget you,” he wrote to his son. ‘I will always love you.’ “You are my son,’ he replied, “and I will always be your son.” “And I will never leave you, my son. I will forever love you’, he said, ‘even though I’m no longer your son’. Cú Chulainn, hero of Ulster, stood at the ford at Cooley, ready to face an entire army singlehandedly. The army in question belonged to Queen Meadhbh of Connaught. Enraged at her husband’s possession of a white bull of awesome strength, she had set out to capture the fabled brown bull of Ulster at any cost. Cú Chulpainn invoked the sacred rite of single combat in order to fight the intruders one by one.

down again— all for trying to cheat death. As you can see, Achilles, the Underworld is full of exciting amenities. Here, you don't have to worry about brutal wars or painful cycles of revenge. You can finally just put your feet up and relax. It's a great place to take a break from your daily life. It also has a great view of the city of Athens, which is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. It is also a great spot to take some time off from your regular life and recharge your batteries. The Underworld is actually a lovely place to "live" It boasts historic charm and eccentric neighbors with eternal ties to the area. Tartarus is reserved for a select few who some might call the greatest sinners of all time. Elysium is the Underworld’s exclusive VIP section— and your permanent home. The Underworld also features four other waterways: Acheron, the river of woe; Cocytus, river. of wailing; Lethe, river of oblivion; and Phlegethon, a. great source of natural light.

DNA microarray experiments and how you can use it to profile disease states and cells versus healthy cells. And then at the beginning of the next class, I'll describe how you get information out of DNA microarrays. But at the end of the day, you're always using the fluorophores as the probes for where certain things are, OK. Fluorescence is a magnificent tool. We can use fluorophore on their own, or we can use them as attached to antibodies. Fluorescence is the emission of light in the absence of heat. Luminescence is the general term. Fluorescence is a little bit more specific. There are different types of luminescence. And you'll get to see some of those varieties of luminecence. The first thing to learn about fluorescence is how to spell it. It is actually fluor-L-L. It's a biological reaction that causes luminescent. And this is a cuttlefish shown here in this image in the corner where they are brightly lit at night.

is a function of those independent variables that measures the transformation quantity for the transformation between two different phases. For example, in the case of water, the quantity of water in the solution is the ratio of the water volume to the volume of the solution. For the example, the total water volume is the sum of the volumes of the solutions of the two phases. The total water content is the product of the proportions of the different water volumes. For more information, see the Wikipedia article on water.  RAFAEL JARAMILLO: Today we're going to discuss the many D's of thermodynamics. We'll talk about lowercase d, lowercase Greek d, and uppercase Greek D. He'll draw a 3D visualization of how the entropy for a given phase might vary with pressure and temperature at a fixed composition. Jaramillo: The most common transformations that we talk about are transformations that take place at constant pressure and constant temperature, isobaric and isothermal transformations.

patient's breathing in and breathing out so that's why you're hearing it on inspiration and expiration now it can sound similar to a parac cardial friction rub how do you tell the difference um if you are wanting to know is this the lungs or is this this the heart just listen have the patient hold their breath. If you can still hear that harsh grading sound it's the heart because they're holding their breath their lungs aren't moving so you've rolled out the lungs. That is lung occultation and normal breast sounds versus abnormal breast sounds. In this video I'm going to be going over lung oscilation specifically the sites of where you osculate. We're going to go over some audio clips of normal breath sounds and where you should hear them at CU that's a big thing. We'll also go over abnormal breath sounds. In the next video I'll be performing an assessment on a patient and show you how to listen with your stethoscope to these sides. I'll also give you some landmarks to make your job easier so you'll know what intercostal space correlates with which lobe of the lung.

that there are the kinds of discontents that we have been talking about which find the leader in the form of a man who is an outstanding figure for some reason, who is willing to try to establish a tyranny. That it fails, I think, is an indication that the same forces haven't reached the power in Athens that they had reached in Megara, Corinth, Sicyon, and places like that. It's a warning about troubles ahead and I'll turn to those troubles in the next hour. Professor Donald Kagan: Sparta is the most important of the early poleis. He says the only decisions made were questions of whether to go to war, whether to make peace. Kagan says when a question was put to the Spartans, they responded by shouting and banging on their shields. The only people who spoke at those assemblies were the kings, the gerousia, or a group of people I haven't mentioned to you yet, the ephors, the five ephor.

So thank you guys so much for coming. I know you guys could have slept an extra hour. Ka-Yen: "I walked into MIT not knowing a single thing about nuclear energy" "I'm going to be talking about the functionality and the benefits and the problems associated nuclear" "In 1951, the first nuclear reactor to produce electricity was the experimental breeder reactor, the EDR1" "From 1975 to 2002, there was this huge boom in nuclear energy, which is about this little chunk over here" "You can see that nothing really happened between the 90s and the 2000s"

the back door. On Friday, let me just remind you, Il Principe. We'll study Machiavelli. On this very partisan note I conclude. On Thursday, we'll study the life of the Italian statesman and play a game of chess with him. We're going to see how well he can play the game of poker. I'm looking forward to it. I hope you'll join us for the game on Friday night at 8 p.m. ET on CNN. Professor Steven Smith: I want to talk today about Aristotle's discovery of America. He says Aristotle discovered the American Constitution 1,500 or 2,000 years before it was written. Smith: Aristotle's proposal for a mixture of oligarchy and democracy seems, in many ways, to anticipate James Madison's call for a government where powers must be separated. But Aristotle's mixed constitution differs from ours still in certain important respects, he says. He doesn't so much insist, as you will see in your reading, on the actual separation of functions of government.

SNLI and MultiNLI into Turkish. XNLI is a bunch of assessment data sets that is dev-test splits for more than a dozen languages. Those are human-created translations that could be used to benchmark multilingual NLI systems. So there's a wide world of tasks you can explore, and I think that makes NLI a really exciting space in which to develop original systems, and projects, and so forth. And those could be interesting for seeing how well a model can grapple with variation that comes in very specific and technical domains. SNLI is the Stanford Natural Language Inference Corpus-- MultiNLI, and Adversarial NLI. The premises are all image captions from the image Flickr30K data set. All the hypotheses were written by crowdworkers. The overall Fleiss kappa measured interannotator agreement was 0.7, which is a high rate of agreement. It's clear at this point, for example, that ensembles of deep learning methods are the best for this problem, says Christopher Potts.

Summary:
more because it doesn't make sense from a marginal revenue point of view. This gap, the difference between the price and the marginal cost at this rational quantity for this firm in an imperfectly competitive market to produce, economists would refer to this as an inefficiency, inefficiency. Folks are willing to pay more than that marginal cost, but you still have no motivation to produce more. Because if you produce more, even though the price is higher, your marginal revenue is going to be below themarginal cost. In a perfectly competitive market, the firm is a price-taker. No matter how many units they produce, they're just going to be able to get that same market price. A firm in an imperfectly competitive market will have their own firm-specific demand curve. The price that they get in the market is higher than the marginal cost and the marginal revenue at that point. Folks are willing to pay more than that marginal cost, but you still have no motivation to produce more.

They can be bought at the store, but you have to pay for them in cash. They're not available on the internet. You must buy them in the store to get them. You cannot buy them on the Internet. They must be bought from the hardware stores. That is it. They have to be bought in the stores. Rigidity is really about the lack of motion. In infinitesimal motion, you can think about this in the absence of a motion. You need some smoothness. If there's a way to get started moving, that doesn't actually mean you could actually move. So we're going to need some linear algebra. That's one thing that's useful. So the idea is we think about rigidity-- does a linkage move or not-- to the first order. First order means first derivative.

Summary:
Deep Blue’s triumph over Garry Kasparov in 1997 was the first time a machine had defeated a sitting champion. Today, chess software is capable of consistently defeating the best human players. But just like the game they’ve mastered, these machines are products of human ingenuity. And perhaps that same ingenuity will guide us out of this apparent checkmate, as it did in the case of chess greats such as Benoît Mitterrand and Toulouse-Laffitte. Chess has been known as a tool of military strategy, a metaphor for human affairs, and a benchmark of genius. The game was originally known as chaturanga– a Sanskrit word for "four divisions" With its spread to Sassanid Persia, it acquired its current name and terminology– "chess," derived from "shah," meaning king. Chess-playing computers had been developed for decades, but Deep Blue’s triumph over Garry Kasparov in 1997 was the first time a machine had defeated a sitting champion.

Summary:
do this when you have something that sums to 1. It's not more complicated than what I wrote here, but make sure independently you go through it and ask questions. In the next class, as I said, what we're going to see is this notion of factor analysis. And that is going to tell us how to apply EM to a different kind of setting, which, at first glance, will look kind of impossible to do without a latent variable model. And I think that's all I want to say. The EM algorithm is an unsupervised version of k-means GMM. In GMM, you guess randomly an assignment of every point to the cluster, the probability. You guess where they're probabilistically linked, that is, what's the probability of these points belong to cluster one, this point belongs to cluster two. And then once you have that, you then solve some estimation problem that looks like a traditional supervised learning. The decomposition is quite important. And we're going to try and kind of abstract that away.
