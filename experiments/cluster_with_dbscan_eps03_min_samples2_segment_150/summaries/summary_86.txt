Cú Chulainn, hero of Ulster, stood at the ford at Cooley, ready to face an entire army singlehandedly. The army in question belonged to Queen Meadhbh of Connaught. Enraged at her husband’s possession of a white bull of awesome strength, she had set out to capture the fabled brown bull of Ulster at any cost. But the King of Ulster had chosen this moment to force the goddess Macha to race her chariot while pregnant. In retaliation, she struck down him and his entire army with stomach cramps. broken heart, leaving behind a land that would remain ravaged by Meadhbh’s war for years to come. “I will never forget you,” he wrote to his son. ‘I will always love you.’ “You are my son,’ he replied, “and I will always be your son.” “And I will never leave you, my son. I will forever love you’, he said, ‘even though I’m no longer your son’. Cú Chulainn and Ferdiad met in Scotland while training with the renowned warrior Scáthach. When they returned to their respective homes, they found themselves on opposite sides of a war. The Queen was impatient to get her hands on the prize bull. She goaded him and questioned his honor until he had no choice but to fight. But their teacher had shared a secret with him alone. She told him how to summon the Gáe Bulg, a magical broken heart, leaving behind a land that would remain ravaged for years to come.
