The Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act of 1990 and its implementing regulations require colleges to publish and distribute an annual security report. The law also requires colleges to provide timely warning to the campus community about crimes that are considered to represent a threat to other students and employees. According to a 1996 publication of the Student Press Law Center, 11 states have laws requiring schools to compile and release statistics on campus crime. The Department of Education has only recently expanded its monitoring efforts by initiating program reviews that address compliance with the actâ€™s reporting requirements.
