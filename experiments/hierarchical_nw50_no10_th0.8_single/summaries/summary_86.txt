User financing is one approach to financing federal programs or activities. User fees assign part or all of the costs of the benefits and services derived from these programs and activities to recipients. The fees vary in the way they are set, collected, used, and reviewed, which may affect their efficiency, equity, revenue adequacy, and administrative costs. In 2006 we reported that financial management issues at CBP and APHIS adversely affect the AQI programâ€™s ability to perform border inspections.
