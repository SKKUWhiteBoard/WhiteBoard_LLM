The mean is a more familiar measure, while the median does not tend to be influenced by outliers. A nomination that took an extraordinarily long time might cause a significant change in the mean, but the median would be unaffected. Appendix A presents a table of all nominations and recess appointments to positions in independent and other agencies, organized alphabetically by last name and following a similar format to that of the agency-by-agency nomination action tables. Congress appear in two tables for each agency, "Incumbents in Full-time PAS Positions, as of the End of the 111 th Congress" and "Nomination Action During the 111th Congress" Some agencies had no nomination activity during this period of time. An incumbent's name followed by "(A)" indicates an official who was, at that time, serving in an acting capacity. For most presidentially appointed positions requiring Senate confirmation, the pay levels fall under the Executive Schedule. This report explains the process for filling positions to which the President makes appointments with the advice and consent of the Senate. It identifies, for the 111 th Congress, all nominations to full-time positions requiring Senate confirmation in 41 organizations in the executive branch. Of these nominations, 92 were confirmed, 14 were returned to the President, and 1 was withdrawn. The length of time a given nomination may be pending in the Senate varies widely. Some nominations are confirmed within a few days, others may not be confirmed for several months, and some are never confirmed. A profile of each agency tracks the agency's nominations, providing information on Senate activity. The profiles also identify, for each agency, positions requiring Senate confirmation, the incumbents in those positions as of the end of the 111 th Congress, and the pay levels of those officials. The Constitution (Article II, Section 2) empowers the President to nominate and, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint the principal officers of the United States. Reports are based on U.S. reports. The act does not apply to positions on multi-headed regulatory boards and commissions or to certain other specific positions which may be filled temporarily under other statutory provisions. In addition, during a presidential transition, the 210-day restriction period does not begin until either 90 days after the President assumes office, or 90 day after the vacancy occurs. During the 111 th Congress, President Barack Obama submitted to the Senate 107 nominations to full-time positions in independent agencies, agencies in the Executive Office of the President (EOP), multilateral agencies, and legislative. for each independent agency nomination confirmed in the 111 th Congress, the number of days between nomination and confirmation ("days to confirm") The mean (average) number of. days taken by the Senate to confirm a nomination to a position covered by this report was 93.1. The median number of Days to Confirm a nominee was 65.5. The agency profiles provide data on presidential nominations and appointments to full-time positions requiring Senate confirmation, and Senate action on the nominations. Data on appointment actions during the 111th Congress appear in two tables for each agency. Congress has enacted provisions that restrict the pay of recess appointees. The President has an incentive to use his recess appointment authority in ways that allow them to be paid. If the position falls vacant while the Senate is in session and the President fills it by recess appointment, the appointee may not be paid from the Treasury until provisions have been interpreted by the Department of Justice to preclude payment of an appointee who is given successive recess appointments to the same position. The provision reads, "Hereafter, no part of any appropriation contained in this or any other Act shall be paid to any person" by the Senate within 30 days before the end of the session and an individual other than the one whose nomination was rejected thereafter receives a recess appointment. A recess appointment falling under any one of these three exceptions must be followed by a nomination to the position not later than 40 days after the beginning of the next session of the Senate. For this reason, the President generally submits a new nomination for the nominee even when an old nomination is pending. These provisions have been interpreted by the Department of Justice to the tables in this report. The Senate structured its 2010 pre-election break as a series of shorter recesses separated by pro forma sessions. The practice reportedly stemmed from a lack of agreement between the Senate majority leader and the Senate minority leader regarding the disposition of pending nominations. Under Senate rules, nominations must be returned to the White House if the Senate goes on recess for more than 30 days, forcing the president to resubmit nominations and committees to days. The Senate sometimes waives those rules, but just before the August recess, it returned 16 controversial nominees. The Senate historically has confirmed most, but not all, executive nominations. Rarely, however, has a vote to confirm a nomination failed on the Senate floor. Usually, unsuccessful nominations fail to be reported or discharged from committee. Failure of a nomination to make it out of committee has occurred for a variety of reasons, including opposition to the nomination, inadequate amount of time for consideration of the nomination and factors that may not be directly related to the merits of the nominations. The Senate rules provide that "[nominations neither confirmed nor rejected during the session at which they are made shall not be acted upon at any succeeding session without a vote" Much of the Senate confirmation process occurs at the committee level. Committee nomination activity has generally included investigation, hearing, and reporting stages. Hearings provide a public forum to discuss a nomination and any issues related to the program or agency for which the nominee would be responsible. Even where confirmation has been thought by most to be a virtual certainty, hearings have provided Senators and the nominee with opportunities to go on the record with particular views or commitments. A committee may decline to act on a nomination at any point—upon referral, after investigation, or after a hearing. In the second stage, the Senate alone determines whether or not to confirm a nomination. The Senate's scrutiny of a nomination has depended largely on the importance of the position involved, existing political circumstances, and policy implications. Two other factors have sometimes affected the examination of a nominee's personal and professional qualities: whether the President's party controlled the Senate, and the degree to which the President became involved in supporting the nomination. Much of the Senate confirmation process takes place behind closed doors in the Senate. President has cleared the candidate, the nomination is ready to be submitted to the Senate. The selection and clearance stage has often been the longest part of the appointment process. At the end of 2004, in an effort to reduce the elapsed time between a new President's inauguration and the appointment of his or her national security team, the White House began a new process for the selection of national security advisers. The process has been called the "National Security Nominee Selection and Appointment Process (NSCAP)". Congress enacted amendments to the Presidential Transition Act of 1963. These amendments encourage a President-elect to submit, for security clearance, potential nominees to high-level national security positions as soon as possible after the election. A separate provision of law, enacted as part of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, lengthens, during presidential transitions, the potential duration of a temporary appointment by 90 days. Although this provision might give some additional flexibility to an incoming President, it might also lengthen the appointment process for some positions. the appointee may not be paid from the Treasury until he or she is confirmed by the Senate. However, the salary prohibition does not apply (1) if the vacancy arose within 30 days before the end of the session of the Senate; or (2) if a nomination for the office, other than the nomination of an individual appointed during the preceding recess, was pending before the Senate for its advice and consent. The salary prohibition doesn't apply if the Senate rejects a nomination within a certain period of time. who is occupying a position requiring Senate confirmation to perform those tasks. The temporary appointment is for 210 days, but the time restriction is suspended if a first or second nomination for the position is pending. In addition, during a presidential transition, the 210-day period can be extended to a maximum of two years. The President may select any officer or employee of the subject agency who is occupies a position for which the rate of pay is equal to or greater than the minimum rates of pay at the GS-15 level. shall not be acted upon at any succeeding session without being again made to the Senate by the President. In practice, such pending nominations have been returned to the President at the end of the session or Congress. The President may sign the commission at any time after confirmation, at which point the appointment becomes official. Once the appointee is given the commission and sworn in, he or she has full authority to carry out the responsibilities of the office. The Constitution also empowers the President to make a limited-term appointment without Senate confirmation when the Senate is in recess. opposition party because of their positions in the Senate. Recess appointments have sometimes had political consequences. Some Senate-confirmed positions may also be temporarily filled under the Vacancies Act. A nominee has no legal authority to assume the duties and responsibilities of the position; a nominee who is hired by the agency as a consultant while awaiting confirmation may serve only in an advisory capacity. In the second stage, the Senate alone every few days.... Those pro-forma sessions will keep the White House's nominations alive but also block any recess appointments. Consent of the Senate, to appoint the principal officers of the United States, as well as some subordinate officers. Three distinct stages mark the appointment process: selection and nomination, confirmation, and appointment. Members of Congress and interest groups sometimes recommend candidates for specific PAS positions. In general, the White House is under no obligation to follow such recommendations. But it has been argued that Senators are constitutionally entitled, by virtue of the advice and appointment process, to extend the deadline by which a permanent appointment must be completed. Senators are constitutionally entitled, by virtue of the advice and consent clause, to provide advice to the President regarding his selection. As a practical matter, in instances where Senators perceive insufficient pre-nomination consultation has occurred, they have sometimes exercised their procedural prerogatives to delay or even effectively block consideration of a nomination. During the clearance process, the candidate prepares and submits several forms, including the "Public Financial Disclosure Report" (Standard Form (SF) 278) and the "Questionnaire for National Security Positions" (SF 86) Security Positions" (SF 86), and the White House "Personal Data Statement Questionnaire" The Office of the Counsel to the President oversees the clearance process, which often includes background investigations conducted by the FBI and Office of Government Ethics. If conflicts of interest are found during the background investigation, OGE and the agency ethics officer may work with the candidate to mitigate the conflicts. Once the nomination is ready, it can be submitted to the Senate for consideration. The Senate will vote on the nominee in the coming weeks.
