In Western astrology, it's a constellation determined by when your birthday falls in the calendar. But according to the Chinese zodiac, your shēngxiào is the animal assigned to your birth year. Of the many myths explaining these animal signs and their arrangement, the most enduring one is that of the Great Race. The first twelve animals to make it across the river would earn a spot on the zodiac calendar in the order they arrived. Each year is associated with one of the animals in this order, with the cycle starting over every 60 years.
