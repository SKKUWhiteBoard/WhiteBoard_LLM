Sadhana sadhana is a machine learning scientist at Themis Ai and the lead TA of the course intro to deep learning at MIT. She'll be teaching us more about specifically the bias and the uncertainty of AI algorithms which are really two key or critical components towards achieving this Mission or this vision of safe and trustworthy deployment of AI all around us. Sadhana will talk about how we can build very modular and flexible methods for AI and building what we call asafe and trustworthy Ai. behalf of Themis so over the past decade we've seen some tremendous growth in artificial intelligence across safety critical domains in the Spheres of autonomy and Robotics. A lot of these Technologies were innovated five ten years ago but you and I don't see them in our daily lives so what is what's the Gap here between Innovation and deployment. We'll talk about how Themis is innovating in these areas in order to bring new algorithms in this space to Industries around the world after we talk about the ramifications for this for real world AI. Commercial facial detection systems are everywhere you actually played around with some of them in lab two when you trained your vae on a facial detection data set. The biases in these models were only uncovered once an independent study actually constructed a data set that is specifically designed to uncover these sorts of biases by balancing across race and gender. There are other ways that data sets can be biased that we haven't yet talked about so so far we've assumed a pretty key assumption in our data set which is that the number of faces in ourData is the exact same as theNumber of non-faces in our Data set. lecture so so far we've been focusing mainly on facial recognition systems and a couple of other systems as canonical examples of bias however bias is actually far more widespread in machine learning. Consider the example of autonomous driving many data sets are comprised mainly of cars driving down straight and sunny roads in really good weather conditions with very high visibility. In some specific cases you're going to face adverse weather bad um bad visibility near Collision scenarios and these are actually the samples that are the most important for the model to learn. Uncertainty or when a model does not know the answer is the core idea behind uncertainty estimation. In the real world uncertainty estimation is useful for scenarios like this this is an example of a Tesla car driving behind a horse-drawn buggy which are very common in some parts of the United States. The exact same problem that resulted in that video has also resulted in numerous autonomous car crashes. There are multiple different types of uncertainty in neural networks which may cause incidents like the ones that we just saw. compete in the competition which the details are described in the lab but basically it's about analyzing this data set creating risk-aware models that mitigate bias and uncertainty in the specific training pipeline. At Themis our goal is to design advance and deploy a trustworthy AI across Industries and around the world.
