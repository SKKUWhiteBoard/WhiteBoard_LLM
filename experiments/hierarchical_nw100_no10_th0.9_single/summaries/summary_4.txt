At the end of July 2010, over 10,000 military medical personnel were deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. The United Statesâ€™ military presence in Iraq is scheduled to end no later than December 31, 2011. The military has established five levels of medical care to treat injured or sick military personnel, with each level providing progressively more intensive treatment. Not all patients progress through all levels of care, and patients being evacuated may skip one or more levels of treatment as appropriate. The U.S. command structure in Iraq and. Afghanistan has evolved over time.
