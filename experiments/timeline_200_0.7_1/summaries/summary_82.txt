There are three common uses of a rotation matrix. The first is to represent an orientation. The second is to change the frame of reference of a vector. And the third is to rotate a vector or frame. To demonstrate these, I will use these three coordinate frames, representing the same space with different orientations. To help you visualize these frames in 3 dimensions, Iâ€™ll use my handy tinkertoy frame. This is the z-axis, this is the x-axis and the y-axis. we will learn how to represent the angular velocity of a frame. We will also learn about how to use the frame to represent a frame's angular velocity. We'll also look at how the frame is used to represent an object's speed. We hope you will join us for the next few weeks of classes on how to work with a frame in this class. The next class will be on the physics of the frame in which we are working. The final class will take place in the next week or so.
