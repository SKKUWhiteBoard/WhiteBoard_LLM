In 1986, the United States, the FSM, and the RMI entered into the original Compact of Free Association. Economic development and self-sufficiency were not achieved under the original compact. U.S. assistance accounted for more than 50 percent of government revenues throughout the compact period. The United States negotiated separate amended compacts with RMI and FSM that went into effect on May 1, 2004, and June 25, 2004. The amendedcompacts continue the military relationship, including access to military facilities on Kwajalein Atoll.
