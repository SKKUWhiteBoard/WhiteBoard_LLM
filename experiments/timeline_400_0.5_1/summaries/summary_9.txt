So let us say we are talking about price of good 1 has gone up substitution, income these are the effects and overall. When P 1 goes up subs because of substitution effect x 1 will. Come down. And for income also because of income effect it will come down. While inferior goods substitution effect quantity demanded would come down while income effect is Up. Up. Can you give me an example its very very difficult to find Giffen good in real life why? Sir, like if Gucci is a brand and it is. Prices comes down by significant amount. No one could buy a Gucci, it is it is at that level only because of it is prices. for meat and other food products. To get enough calorie; they had to increase the consumption of potato. So, in that case if this story is true then potato is Giffen good ok, but the problem is with this the second requirement that income effect is larger than the substitution effect. Typically this is not fulfilled that is why we have very-very hard time getting finding out, figuring out Giffsen good in an economy. It's very hard to find out what's good.
