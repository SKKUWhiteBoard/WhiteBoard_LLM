U.S. relies on a complex array of computer-dependent and mutually supportive organizational components. Software code that is poorly developed or purposely injected with malicious code could be used to disrupt these and other DOD information systems. Despite the risks associated with foreign access to defense systems, DOD acquisition policy does not require program managers to identify and manage the amount of foreign involvement in software development for defense systems. The Department of Defense estimates that it spends about 40 percent of its Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation budget on software.
