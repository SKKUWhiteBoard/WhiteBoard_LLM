fairness popping up at different universities. University of Pennsylvania has the science of Data ethics, and I've mentioned already this fairness in machine learning class at Berkeley. This is, in fact, one of the topics we've talked about. I'm on a committee that is planning the activities of the new Schwarzman College of Computing. The college obviously hasn't started yet, so we don't have anything other than this lecture and a few other things like that in the works, but the plan is there to expand more in this area. Peter Solovits: I got a call from a committee of the National Academy of Science, Engineering, and Medicine. He says they convened a meeting to talk about the set of topics that I've listed here. Solovitsch: They talked about AI and decision making, privacy and informed consent in an era of big data, science curricula for law schools, emerging issues, and science, technology, and law. The issue of using litigation to target scientists who have opinions that you don't like was also discussed.
