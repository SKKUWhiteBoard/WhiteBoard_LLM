Under the PPACA MLR requirements, private insurers must report annually to CMS. Insurers must pay rebates when their MLRs do not meet or exceed the minimum applicable MLR standards. PPACA requires that private insurers offering group or individual health insurance coverage report annually on the various components that are used to calculate annually on their MLR. The MLR data that insurers report to CMS include the following components, as required by law: Medical claims. Expenses for quality improvement (QI) activities. Non-claims costs.
