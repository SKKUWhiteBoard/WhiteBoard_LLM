AmeriCorps*USA is the largest national and community service program since the Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930s. Participants earn education awards to help pay for postsecondary education in exchange for performing community service. The awards are paid directly to qualified postsecondary institutions or student loan lenders and must be used within 7 years after service is completed. In addition to the education award, participants receive a living allowance stipend that is at least equal to, but no more than double, the average annual living allowance received by Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) participants.
