HONG LIU: Today, we talk about chiral fermions. He says the Dirac equation requires, actually, psi to have four components. But there are two ways to reduce it, and one is called the Majorana fermion, he says. HONG LIu: You don't need four components to be able to transform under Lorentz. You just need a smaller unit, OK? He says this tells you that at least two components already can transform. HONG LIU: If tilde is just some other constant, then you multiply gamma 5. So, here, we can rewrite a little bit differently. We can consider rewrite this alpha L and alpha R in terms of the following. Let's consider the two transformation-- one transformation, psi L, and psi R transform the same. And the other transformation is that they transform oppositely. They transform in the opposite phase, OK? So I write the alpha-- and this writing is like that. HONG LIU: In physics, actually, the massless case actually gives you very much richer structure, normally, than the massive particle. In the Dirac spinor, which we have talked about so far, is four components. And then the chiral spinor we talked about-- essentially, you have two complex components. So the next one I'm going to talk about is the Majorana, in which case, I would argue, we have 4 times 1 real component. B when you act on sigma mu B minus 1. So that gives you minus sigmaMu, nu, star, OK? So this is obvious because sigmamu, nu has i there. And, otherwise, the B takes each gamma matrices there into star. So we have used this trick many times. Yeah, and then so we get a very nice relation that, under Lorentz transformation, again, is generated by this B, related to this B matrix. So B, in this case, can only be gamma 2.
