The Coast Guard uses the U.S. Navyâ€™s COTF to conduct operational tests for its major acquisition programs. Operational testing can occur over many test events, including Initial Operational Test and Evaluation. The test event concludes with a rating of operationally effective or not effective, operationally suitable or not suitable. As of January, IOT&E took place about 2 years later than planned and after the 8 NSCs were under contract, the Coast Guard says.
