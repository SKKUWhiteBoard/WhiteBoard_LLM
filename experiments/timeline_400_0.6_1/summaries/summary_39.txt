This is part 2 of a guide to clinical reasoning or how to create an accurate differential diagnosis from a patient's presentation. In the first part I reviewed a practical five-step bedside approach to Clinical reasoning. In this part I will demonstrate how to use this approach with an actual patient case at the student level. I present this patient to you the same way in turn might present the patient to his or her attending on rounds or to their colleagues during a morning report or teaching conference as I present the case I'll keep a running list of the key features of the presentation so they will seem like I am doing step 1 acquired data. There are no causes of four hours of epigastric pain in which we would expect the troponin or CK to be abnormal even in the event that the patient had an acute MI. The combination of acute abdominal pain nausea and a possible contamination of well water is all consistent with heavy-metal poisoning. The most likely diagnosis for this patient is acute pancreatitis if we bring back the key features for this back we see that this is associated with her heavy use of alcohol. The best explanation for the elevated lipase is leukocytosis and leukaemia.
