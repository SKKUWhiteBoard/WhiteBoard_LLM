In particle physics and in nuclear physics, use a system called natural units. This system is based on fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics and special relativity. In this class, we'll use natural units in some examples, and SI units in others. This will always be clear from the problem we're looking at, so we're always looking at the problem at hand. We'll use Heaviside-Lorentz units and combine them with some measurable units we discussed in the previous class.
