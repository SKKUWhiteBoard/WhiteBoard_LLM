The Toxic Substances Control Act was enacted in 1976. It authorizes EPA to review chemicals already in commerce (existing chemicals) and chemicals yet to enter commerce (new chemicals) The EU has recently revised its chemical control policy through legislation known as Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH) Under REACH, authority exists to establish restrictions for any chemical that poses unacceptable risks and to require authorization for the use of chemicals identified as being of very high concern. The EU law places the burden on manufacturers, importers, and downstream users to ensure that they use such substances that do not adversely affect human health or the environment.
