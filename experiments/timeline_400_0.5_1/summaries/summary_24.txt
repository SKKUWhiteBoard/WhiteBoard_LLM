HONG LIU: We have two sides if you want to relate things on two sides. And you have to do guess work. How does this quantity translate into that quantity, et cetera? And then check the consistency. So now let's talk about some further aspects of the duality. AUDIENCE: But being the right hand side, we still have some SO 5, S5. HONG LIu: I will talk about that. So this is more like a space time symmetry. So in N equals 4 super Yang-Mills theory. essentially the semi classical gravity limit because we still treat the matter fields essentially as quantum. HONG LIU: Yang-Mills theory lives on Minkowski space. And then you say you can imagine that this is the boundary, this relation is related to the bulk and the boundary. And this is a postulate based on that fact. Yes? AUDIENCE: I thought one of the motivations for thinking about the holographic duality was to try to escape [INAUDIBLE] And all of a sudden, it strikes me, so we're trying to get on the boundary of AdS. Then they will also exist in the massless particles.
