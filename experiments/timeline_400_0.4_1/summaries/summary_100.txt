In this problem, we're going to be dealing with a variation of the usual coin-flipping problem. But in this case, the bias itself of the coin is going toBe random. And we're told that the expectation of this bias is some mu and that the variance of the bias isSome sigma squared. And what we'll be asked is find a bunch of different expectations, covariances, and variances. We'll see that this problem gives us some good exercise in a few concepts, a lot of iterated expectations. An art that you learn through more practice. But one good rule of thumb is, when you have kind of a hierarchy or layers of randomness, it's useful to condition on the layer above where that is, in this case, the random bias of the coin itself. Once you condition on that layer above, that makes the next level much simpler. Because you kind of assume that you know what all the previous levels ofrandomness are, and that helps you calculate what the expectation for this current level.
