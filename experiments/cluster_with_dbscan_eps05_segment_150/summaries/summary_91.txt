Professor Donald Kagan: Sparta is the most important of the early poleis. He says the only decisions made were questions of whether to go to war, whether to make peace. Kagan says when a question was put to the Spartans, they responded by shouting and banging on their shields. The only people who spoke at those assemblies were the kings, the gerousia, or a group of people I haven't mentioned to you yet, the ephors, the five ephor. that there are the kinds of discontents that we have been talking about which find the leader in the form of a man who is an outstanding figure for some reason, who is willing to try to establish a tyranny. That it fails, I think, is an indication that the same forces haven't reached the power in Athens that they had reached in Megara, Corinth, Sicyon, and places like that. It's a warning about troubles ahead and I'll turn to those troubles in the next hour. what we have, not a monarchy, but a republic. Dominated insofar as it's dominated by anybody but individual aristocrats, by the areopagus. At some point in the history of that institution it consists now of men who have been archon. The year after their archonship they automatically go into the areOPagus and remain areopagites for life. Well, that gives the counsel of theAreopagus even more power and influence, because they consist now, exclusively after awhile, of people who've been chosen for their individual qualities.
