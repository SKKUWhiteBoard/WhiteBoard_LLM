The Current Population Survey (CPS) is the primary source of information on the United States labor force. CPS provides data on where children work, the types of jobs they hold, and how many hours a week they work. In addition, it provides demographic information on children such as age, race, ethnicity, and family income. Because the data have been collected for over 50 years, they can be used to help identify working children in the U.S. The CPS is compiled monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) used to show how the number and characteristics of working children have changed over time. Labor also compiles two additional sources of nationally representative data on working children. The first is the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) The most recent NLSY began in 1997 and is referred to as ‘NLSy97’; it contains data on one group of approximately 9,000 children born from 1980 to 1984. NLSy provides detailed information on the work experiences of this group of children over time and captures data not collected in CPS. Children’s work habits, education, and personal lives. NLSY cannot be used to show how the number and characteristics of all working children have changed over time because it only includes information on one group of children born from 1980 to 1984. The second set is the National Agricultural Workers Survey in which data are collected several times each year from a sample of crop agricultural workers. This survey provides data on the number of children who work in migrant agriculture, their educational attainment, and their mobility. BLS reports all work-related fatalities, including those for children, in its Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries published each year. BLS identifies these fatalities through CPS and NLSY but it is limited. Labor added questions to the survey in fiscal year 2000 to obtain additional data on children who work in agriculture but has not been able to obtain data on a sufficiently large number of children working in crop agriculture to provide information that is statistically reliable. The primary sources of data on. children who are injured or killed as a result of work- related injuries come from BLS and NIOSH. death certificates and reports from state workers’ compensation agencies, medical examiners, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the news media. NIOSH collects data on work- related injuries in its National Electronic Injury Surveillance System from a sample of emergency room records. The employment of working children is generally covered by FLSA and its implementing regulations, which limit the types of jobs, number of children, and wages. BLS collects data from a survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses from a sampling of the injury records employers in private industry are required to maintain. hours, and times of day that children younger than 16 years of age can work. Children who are 14 and 15 years old may work in many jobs in retail stores, restaurants, and gas stations. They may not, however, work in any job considered hazardous, including jobs in manufacturing, mining, construction, transportation, warehousing, communications, and public utilities. The provisions also prohibit 14- and 15-year-olds from working during school hours and limit the number of hours they can work at a job.  FLSA authorizes the Secretary of Labor to designate certain types of jobs and equipment as too hazardous for children under the age of 18. Once children reach age 16, they are only prohibited from working in jobs or with equipment covered by these Hazardous Occupations Orders. For jobs in agriculture, the child labor provisions are much less restrictive. Children of any age may work an unlimited number of hours (outside of school hours) in nonhazardous jobs, either on a farm owned by their parents or on a noncommercial farm with written consent of their parents. employers whose annual gross volume of sales is less than $500,000 and whose work cannot be linked to interstate commerce are not covered under FLSA. In addition, children who are self-employed are not subject to the child labor provisions of FLSA, although they may be covered under state child labor laws. Children who work for their parents are prohibited from working in occupations and operating equipment listed in the Hazardous Occupations Orders. When children reach age 18, they are no longer covered under the Child Labor Act. In 2001, several legislative proposals were submitted in the House of Representatives and the Senate that would strengthen the child labor provisions of FLSA. The proposals include the Children’s Act for Responsible Employment of 2001, which would increase the maximum penalties for child labor violations and prohibit children aged 16 and 17 from working in hazardous occupations in agriculture. The Young American Workers’ Bill of Rights would amend the FLSA to require employers to obtain work permits for all children age 18 and under who are still in school. data on child labor from the states, including data on injuries and illnesses, and add additional restrictions. (See app. II for a list of the legislative proposals introduced in the 107th Congress that would strengthen the child labor provisions of FLSA.) Labor’s Wage and Hour Division (WHD) is responsible for enforcing the child labour provisions ofFLSA. WHD’S national office develops the goals and performance measures for Labor's child labor compliance efforts and reports on the results of its efforts in annual performance plans. is also responsible for providing guidance and training to WHD’s regional and district offices and for assessing the results of their child labor compliance efforts. Much of the responsibility for planning and executing these efforts is left to the discretion of WHD's five regional offices and the 50 district offices that report directly to the regions. The Child Labor Team Leader in the headquarters office is responsible for coordinating WHD ‘s child labor Compliance efforts, including disseminating information and guidance to the regional andDistrict offices.  WHD’s child labor compliance efforts comprise several strategies: enforcement, partnerships, education and outreach, and public awareness. Education and outreach activities are specifically targeted to groups that can have an impact on youth employment, such as teachers, parents, and employers. Its public awareness strategy is designed to inform the general public about the child labor provisions of FLSA through activities such as press releases. The Field Operations Handbook for investigators, and overseeing special projects, is available on WHD's website. of children under age 18, and maintaining a Web site with information on the child labor provisions of FLSA and state child labor laws. WHD’s enforcement actions include on-site investigations of employers and other activities designed to bring employers into compliance with the law. The penalties for child labor violations depend on the severity of the violations, the number of times the violations occurred, and aggravating factors such as falsification of records and whether the employer has a record of previous child labor. Over the past decade, according to data tabulated from CPS, the number and characteristics of working children have not changed. In 2001, working children were as sizable a part of the United States labor force as they were in 1990. Most children worked in a variety of occupations concentrated in a few select industries, primarily in the manufacturing industry. The penalties range from $275 for a record-keeping violation to $11,000 for a violation involving a serious injury or death. Information on WHD’s investigations, violations, and penalties assessed is tracked in its investigations database–the Wage and Hour Investigative Support and Reporting Database. In 2001, as in 1990, minority children and children from families with annual incomes below $25,000 were more likely than other children to work illegally. As many as 3.7 million children between the ages of 15 and 17 worked, about 30 percent of all children in this age range. The percentage of children who worked in summer months fluctuated over the decade from a high of 36 percent in 1990 to a low of 30 percent in 2001. Although most children work for an employer, in 2001, about 52,000 (2 percent) were self-employed. About 4 percent of all children who worked were employed in agriculture in 2001. Most children working in crop agriculture throughout the decade were boys aged 16 and 17. The percentage of boys increased, as did the percentage of children who were foreign-born and newcomers to this country. The characteristics of children incrop agriculture changed somewhat over the decade, according to the data in the National Agricultural Workers Survey. The data in this survey, however, does not show that the characteristics of crop agriculture children have changed. Most children working in agriculture are 16 years of age and older. The percentage of younger children (14- and 15-year-olds) who work in agriculture has increased, from 17 percent to 30 percent. More children work in summer months when school is out of session than in school months. In 2001, 30 percent of all children worked in agriculture; in 2012, it was 31 percent. The number of children who entered the country illegally to work in Agriculture rose over the decade, as did the percentage of those who were not accompanied by their parents. aged 15 to 17 worked in summer months, compared to 23 percent who worked in school months. 87 percent of all working children worked part-time in 2001. Children worked about the same number of hours in 2001 as in 1990. In 2001, children worked an average of 21 hours a week inSummer months. This is similar to the number of. hours they worked in both summer and school months in 1990, when they worked an. average of 16 hours per week in summer and summer months. 1990, their average hourly earnings increased by 10 percent. The older a child is, the more likely he or she is to work. In 1990, children paid an hourly salary earned an average of $5.70 an hour; in 2001, the average hourly salary was $6.36. The amount by which their earnings exceeded the minimum wage increased by $1.21. By 2001, children’s average hourly Earnings exceeded the Minimum Wage of $ 5.15 an hour. greater in the summer when more children work. Older children are more likely to work in the retail trade industry than younger children. For example, in summer months in 2001, nearly 60 percent of all 17-year-olds worked. In 2001, 17- years-old boys worked an average of 23 hours a week in summer hours, 5 more hours a year than 15-years-olds and 2 more years a week than 16-somethings. In the summer months of 2001, 33 percent of 16-year old boys worked, while only 15 percent of 15-year olds worked. of employed 17-year-olds worked in retail trade, whereas 38 percent of employed 15-year old worked in this industry. Children from families with lower incomes are less likely to work than those from higher income families, and minority children are less Likely to Work than white children. In addition to age, family income and race are also related to children’s employment. About 1 in 5 children in the U.S. are employed in some form of retail trade or other industry, according to a recent study. 17 percent of children in families with annual incomes below $25,000 a year worked in 2001. In 2001, 15 percent of black children and 17 percent of Hispanic children worked. Despite the fact that children from lower income families are less likely to work, when they do work, they tend to work more hours. Children in Families with Annual Incomes Under $75,000 worked an average of 21 hours a week in 2001, 5 more hours per week than children in Families With Incomes Over $75k. children whose families had annual incomes of $75,000 or more. While all minority children were less likely to work than white children, Hispanic children who were employed worked more hours than other children. As many as 4 percent of all 15- to 17-year-olds who worked in 2001 worked illegally, either because they worked more. hours than allowed under the law or because they work in prohibited hazardous occupations. Because the federal government does not track child labor, it is difficult to determine how many children work illegally. Child labor provisions of FLSA for 15-year-olds are more restrictive. In 2001, over 21 percent of all employed 15- year-olds worked illegally in school months. This compares to 1 percent of 16- and 17-year old workers. Most of the children who worked illegally were 15- years-old who worked more hours than allowed. The percentage of 15-somethings who worked illegal in schoolmonth increased over the period. The overall percentage of children who work illegally in both summer months and school months remained constant from 1990 to 2001. under the child labor provisions of FLSA. Of the 15-year-olds who worked illegally, nearly 80 percent worked an excessive number of hours. Because of the hours restrictions, they were much more likely to work illegally in school months than in summer months. Although most children worked in the retail trade industry during the past decade, a substantial percentage of the illegal employment was in prohibited industries and occupations. They also worked more than the allowed number ofhours, and they also worked in prohibited occupations. was found in other industries (see fig. 3). In 2001, although only 3 percent of all children worked in manufacturing, this industry accounted for 14 percent of. all illegally employed children. Children who were employed in prohibited occupations were most commonly employed illegally in transportation-related occupations. Over 40 percent of children employed illegally were employed illegally because they worked in transportation related occupations, according to our estimates. The majority of children who worked in these occupations were working in sales and services occupations, but also in manufacturing and construction. worked in prohibited occupations worked as truck drivers. We determined that a child’s gender, race, and citizenship status were related to the likelihood that he or she worked in a prohibited occupation. There was no correlation, however, between family income and prohibited occupations. In 2001, boys were more likely than girls to work in prohibited jobs. In addition, black children were less likely than children of other races. Children who were not citizens were morelikely than those who were citizens to work. income and children who worked in hazardous occupations. 32 percent of all employed 15-year-olds with family incomes less than $25,000 a year worked more hours than allowed under the law. Hispanic children are more likely to work too many hours than other children. The region of the country in which children live as well as the type of area in which they live (metropolitan or nonmetropolitan) are also associated with illegal employment. In 2001, 42 percent of Hispanic 15- year-olds worked more years than allowed during school months. In school months in 2001, 15-year-olds in the South and West were almost 1.5 times more likely than their counterparts in the Northeast and Midwest to work more hours than allowed. The data on children who work has been collected in CPS for 50 years, and therefore provides useful information on children's work habits, the report says. The report also found that 15- year-olds who lived in metropolitan areas were 1.4 times more Likely to work. more hours. than those who lived. in nonmetropolitan areas. Data on children younger than age 15 are not collected by CPS. In 1989, Labor stopped collecting data on 14-year-olds in CPS. These children are allowed under FLSA and its implementing regulations to work in many jobs. The estimates presented in this report paint an incomplete picture of the employment patterns for younger children, the report says. The U.S. Department of Labor has released a new report on child labor trends in the United States. The report will be released on Thursday. While some data are collected directly from children who work, most of the information in CPS on working children is provided by an adult member of the household. Because the adult answering the questions may not be aware of the full extent of the child’s activities, information about the child's employment may be underreported or omitted. Another BLS survey, NLSY, collects information on children differently. In NLSy, children are directly asked by interviewers to describe their jobs as well as their activities at The percentage of children who work reported in NLSY is much higher than in CPS. For example, about 24 percent of all 15-year-olds worked in a particular week during the summer of 1996,while CPS data showed that 18 percent of 15- year-olds working in that same period. In addition, NLSy collects data on younger children who worked. For more information, visit NlsY97.work and CPS97. Work.work, or call 1-800-273-8255 or visit www.nlsy97.com. example, NLSY97 showed that 13 percent of all 14-year-olds worked for an employer in a particular week during the summer of 1996. The number and characteristics of children who die each year as a result of a work-related injury have changed little over the past decade. From 1992 to 2000, the number of fatalities and the fatality rates for working were the same as they were in the early 1990s. (See table 4 for more information) The number of children in the U.S. who die from a work related injury was the same in the 1990s as it was in the 1980s. The number and characteristics of work-related fatalities and fatality rates for working children remained relatively constant from 1992 to 2000. Most of the children killed were boys 16 years of age or older. Boys were almost eight times more likely to die as a result of a work- related injury than girls. Retail trade and construction accounted for 20 percent and 14 percent of all fatalities, respectively. Children who worked for small employers account for nearly two-thirds of the fatalities for which employer size was reported. for all work-related injuries serious enough to cause children to miss at least one day of work. NIOSH’s estimate was based on records of injuries treated in emergency rooms. Different types of injuries were more prevalent among those reported by employers. BLS data for 1992 to 2000 showed that sprains, strains, and tears were the most common injuries. The BLS and NIOSH data also, over time, indicate different trends in the numbers of work- related injuries to children. of the injuries occurred to boys, even though they accounted for only about half of all working children. During this period, children aged 16 and over sustained the vast majority of all work-related injuries. Injuries are caused by a variety of factors, but most frequently from coming into contact with an object or equipment. About 65 percent of the injuries from 1992 to 2000 required children to miss 5 or fewer days of work, while 20 percent required them to miss more than 10 days. Labor has devoted substantial resources to ensuring compliance with the child labor provisions of FLSA. Since 1990, Labor has developed better goals for increasing employer compliance with the child labor provisions of FLSA. Labor recently established specific goals for fiscal year 2003 for the industries in which children are most likely to work. Labor does not provide sufficient guidance and training to its regional and district offices on how to use their resources most effectively or help them consistently apply the child labour provisions ofFLSA. WHD has not developed adequate methods of measuring the success of its child labor compliance efforts over the past decade. district offices to conduct self-initiated child labor investigations. WHD officials told us that it is not necessary for the national office to require all of its district offices to do so. However, WHD would have missed a large proportion of the cases with child labor violations if some district offices had not conducted self- initiated investigations. In some years, many districts had no child labor initiatives and the number of child labor Initiatives varied significantly from one region to another. In addition, some regional and district offices do not use data on previous child labor Violations to target their compliance efforts. that limited resources are used in the most effective manner. establish additional specific, measurable goals for WHD’s child labor compliance efforts for industries in which children are most likely to be injured or killed. develop methods of measuring the success of WHD's child labor efforts, including its education and outreach activities. routinely obtain data from BLS and NIOSH on the industries, occupations, and locations in which. children work and sustain work-related injuries. consider enhancing the data collected on children who work by expanding CPS to include 14-year olds. To estimate the number of children who are employed illegally in the United States, we compared data obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’s Current Population Survey. Because CPS does not capture data on children in the U.S. who work in occupations that are illegal under criminal statutes, we could not include them in our estimates. We compared CPS data for 1990, 1996, and 2001 to the child labor provisions of FLSA by defining the base population and identifying illegal employment by occupation and hours. We further refined this analysis by using data from January 1995 to September 1997. through the use of logistic regression for illegal occupations and cross- tabulations for hours. We used data from 36 monthly surveys from CPS for the following years: 1990, 1996 and 2001. For each year, we created data sets with children aged 15 to 17. Each year held roughly 70,000 observations. We defined the base population by using the child labor provisions of FLSA as a guide. Because FLSA does not apply to children who are self-employed, we eliminated children who work in agriculture. who were self-employed and those who worked in agriculture from the data set. Key questions concerning child employment in a family business were not added to CPS until 1994. To obtain numbers of children who worked illegally, we averaged the results of the 2001 base population with the results from the 1990 base population. These children are not covered by FLSA, so we included them in the 2001 data set, even though they are not legally employed in the U.S. as a result of the law. CPS treats ethnicity separately from race. A child can be identified in CPS as both “white” and “Hispanic.” To separately determine the effect of illegal employment on whites, blacks, and Hispanics, we coded the number of children who worked illegally in summer months. The number of illegal workers in the U.S. in the summer months was higher than in the school year, according to the CPS report. The CPS report was released on Tuesday. It is available online at www.cps.org. children whose race was identified as “white” or “black” and whose ethnicity wasidentified as ‘Hispanic,’ as ’Hispanic’ only. For children whose race. was identified. as � ‘black’ or ‘white,�’ and their ethnicity was identified ‘non-Hispanic,' we included them in the category of race identified. This resulted in four racial categories: white, black, Hispanic, and other. For 1996 and 2001, “Other” included Asians and Native Americans. Using methods developed in our previous report and refined by Douglas Kruse, we defined a list of 100 occupational codes that correspond to activities prohibited by the Hazardous Occupations Orders. Any child in the base population with one of these codes was included in our estimates of children employed illegally. We used a similar method to identify occupations specifically prohibited for 15-year-olds. In this instance, 216 occupational codes matched the descriptions of activities prohibited to children under 16. Any. child identified in the Base population with a code that matched this description was included. children employed illegally. Due to the small sample sizes of children identified in these groups, cross tabulations were not statistically significant at the 0.05 level. To determine demographic differences in the likelihood of working illegally, the following variables were included in the model: sex, race, urbanicity (metropolitan or non-metropolitan area), income, citizenship, and region. Differences that were found to be statistically significant are indicated in table 12 below. We used the CPS variable that describes the number of children employed in illegal occupations. number of hours actually worked each week to determine whether 15-year-olds worked more hours than allowed each week under FLSA. Children who worked over 18 hours in a week in school months, from September to May, were included in our estimates of illegal employment. We further refined this analysis by conducting cross tabulations for race, industry, occupation, sex, geographic region, metropolitan area, and income. To estimate the number of 15- year-olds who worked more than allowed under the law, we conducted cross-tabulations for Race, Industry, Occupation, Sex and Geographic Region. We used data for the four regions defined in CPS: Midwest, Northeast, South, and West. The states included in each region are Midwest: Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. Northeast: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont. South: Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, andWest Virginia. West: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. To estimate illegal employment in each state, we combined CPS data for 4 years (48 monthly surveys) from 1998 to 2001. FLSA and implementing regulations and guidance describe activities that children are prohibited from performing. Although CPS data on occupations are fairly specific, they do not list the actual activities children perform on the job. It is not possible to determine whether each child who works in a prohibited occupation category is actually performing prohibited activities. As a result, our estimates of illegal employment are both under- and overstated. many of the child labor violations found by WHD in its investigations of employers are violations of the restrictions on number of hours and times of day that children are allowed to work. CPS does not collect information on the characteristics of employers for which children work, such as sales volume or other proxies for annual dollar amount. Finally, our estimates are overstated to the extent that they include children whose employment is not covered under FLSA, either because their employers do not meet the threshold for enterprise coverage or because the child does not work in interstate commerce. volume of sales, or information that could be used to determine whether children work in interstate commerce. We used data from NLSY97, the survey of children born from 1980 to 1984, to estimate the number of 12- to 14-year-olds who work. The extent to which our estimates are overstated because not all children work under FLSA cannot be determined. We coded children noted in NLSy97 as being born in 1982 as being 12 to 14 years of age. 14 years old in 1996 and children born in 1983 as 14 in 1997. We identified those weeks that contained the 12th day of the month. We determined the frequency of employed children in each of the 16 weeks and averaged the result over the total number of months in each period. We performed these calculations for three periods in 1995, 1996 and one period in 1997 as shown in table 4 in this report. For more information, visit: http://www.nlsy.org/news/features/features-top-stories/1996-97.html. Most employment questions in NLSY deal with events that take place after the child’s 14th birthday. As a result, we used a different method to estimate employment for children younger than 14 years of age. One of the variables identified children who indicated that they had received income from a job in the previous year (1996) We coded children born in 1983 and 1984 as being 13 years and 12 years old. We coded these children as having been employed at some point in the past year. To calculate fatality and injury rates for children, we used data from three BLS sources. We identified 15- to 17-year-olds who died as a result of a work-related injury or sustained a nonfatal injury from 1992 to 2000. Because the number of deaths was so high, we calculated the fatality rate for the previous year. We used the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries and Survey of Occupational injuries and Illnesses to identify the number and characteristics of 15-to-17 year olds who died. We used data from 108 monthly surveys to obtain the total number of hours worked by 15- to 17-year-olds between 1992 and 2000. In computing the rates for nonfatal injuries, we excluded children who worked for the government or were self-employed because they are excluded from the data. We totaled the hours worked each week by all children for each year. We did not aggregate the data on nonf fatal injuries over the decade because the number of injuries reported was large. We calculated fatality and injury rates by using the total amount of hours children worked. industries. Because the data sets for fatal and nonfatal injuries use different industry groupings than CPS, we combined industries. Because we were not able to obtain SOII data that only included 15- to 17-year-olds by industry, we calculated industry rates by dividing the total number of injuries to children under 18. Since CPS data do not include hours worked by children younger than 15, we were unable to include these children in our calculations. However, we did include them in our calculation of industry rates. since children under 15 make up less than 1 percent of all injuries to children, this discrepancy did not affect our estimates. Several legislative proposals were introduced in the 107th Congress to strengthen the child labor provisions of FLSA. In July 2002, the Senate passed the Traveling Sales Crew Protection Act, legislation designed to ensure that child employees of the traveling sales crew are protected from child labor. The bill was passed by the Senate in July 2002 and signed into law by President George W. Bush. The number and characteristics of children who worked from 1990 to 2001 as tabulated from the Current Population Survey (CPS) data we obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) are detailed in the tables below. Other legislative proposals introduced in the 107th Congress are listed in table 13 below. The law includes provisions that prohibit children under age 18 from working in traveling sales work where they remain away from home for more than 24 hours. Our draft report acknowledged the difficulty of estimating the number of children employed in violation. of the child labor provisions of FLSA and the limitations of using CPS data to provide such estimates. While recognizing these limitations, we continue to believe that our analysis provides the best estimates that can be made with available data. In fact, we used the same methods as those used to develop estimates cited by BLS and WHD in several of their publications. For example, in BLS’s November 2000 Report on the Youth Labor Force, they cited estimates of the number of children illegally employed. Labor cites the drop in workplace injuries indicated by the BLS data from the Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses as evidence that “the workplace is becoming safer for young workers.” NIOSH data from emergency room records that indicates that workplace injuries to children are on the rise. Although we highlighted many of Labor’s efforts to improve child labor laws, we highlight many of their efforts to make the workplace safer for children as well as for adults. We also highlight the fact that Labor has been trying to improve the workplace for children for years. ensure compliance with the child labor provisions of FLSA. WHD is correct in its statement that the number of investigator hours devoted to child labor enforcement in fiscal year 2001, 74,000 hours, represents the largest investment of investigator time by WHD in the last 5 years. However, our report, which focuses on WHD’s efforts since 1990, shows that this is lower than the resources dedicated to child labour enforcement in the first half of the decade. We continue to believe that the trends in the number. of child labor violations found and the amount of penalties assessed are not valid indicators of WHD.’S commitment to child. labor compliance. 2001 indicates a growing problem with child labor, improvements in WHD’s efforts to identify violations, or other factors. In 2002, the maximum penalty for a child labor violation was raised from $10,000 to $11,000. We believe the most important indicator of compliance is the percentage of employers who are in compliance with the child labor provisions of FLSA. We disagree that our analysis of fatality rates is a “flawed interpretation of the BLS and NIOSH data” Labor cites only the fatality rates and number of deaths in the wholesale trade industry. We found that the injury rates for children working in this industry were also relatively high. Some of the most serious child labor violations WHD found occurred in sawmills and companies that produce wood pallets. WHD has not developed methods of measuring the success of all of its child labor compliance efforts, particularly its education and outreach and other compliance assistance activities. We also found, in our discussions with WHD officials, that establishing coverage for employers in the construction industry was not a problem. child labor compliance surveys of other industries. 26. In our conversations with WHD headquarters officials and in WHD publications, the number of investigations, violations found, and civil monetary penalties were frequently cited as indicators of the success of the WHD’s child labor enforcement efforts. 27. In fact, on page 3 of the agency”s comments on our report, Labor cites the increase from fiscal years 2000 to 2001 in the number. of child labor violations and the total amount of penalties assessed as evidence of “WHD’S continued strong commitment to child labor compliance” WHD routinely uses BLS and NIOSH data to plan the allocation of its child labor resources. Many states refuse to release this information to WHD because of privacy concerns. WHD has, in fact, used state workers’ compensation data to. plan its enforcement efforts. The district offices we visited confirmed that they do not receive this information for use in planning their local child labor. efforts. We found that WHD. has no procedures for routinely obtaining data from BLS or NIOSH to plan its. child laborenforcement efforts. the past, used only limited data from its WHISARD investigations database to plan its enforcement efforts. In some cases, reports we requested from the database, such as reports that showed the source of investigations completed in fiscal years 2000 and 2001, was the first time that WHD had run such reports. We believe the anecdotal information on injuries and fatalities maintained by WHD’s national office does not provide enough information to be useful in making WHD's resource allocation decisions. The information on fatalities and serious injuries to children was provided to us in May. 2002 contained data on only 7 fatalities and 36 injuries reviewed by WHD in fiscal year 2001. We clarified our conclusions to acknowledge that collecting these data may require additional resources. We agree with Labor’s statement that our recommendation to consider enhancing the data collected on children who work by expanding CPS to include 14-year-olds or beginning additional cohorts of NLSY cannot be implemented without additional study and resources, which is why we recommended that the Secretary “consider” these actions. We continue to believe that WHD’s regional and district offices cannot target their resources in the most effective manner without having better criteria from WHD's national office on how to target their enforcement efforts. We also believe WHD should use information from BLS and NIOSH on the industries in which children work and those in which they are most likely to be injured or killed.
