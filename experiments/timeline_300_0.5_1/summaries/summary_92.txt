Mathematically, a consumer is trying to maximize his utility. And this utility maximization has to be done with respect to some constraint and the constraint the budget constraint we take P 1 x 1; P 2 x 2 should be less than or equal to I. In real life, it is possible that a person derives some satisfaction from having some money left in his pocket, but the way this problem has been framed here the personâ€™s satisfaction depends only on his level of consumption of good 1, and good 2. I is P 1 x 1 plus P 2 x 2. What is e? E is nothing. We are checking we have set up the problem such that this I is equal to this u naught and what we have learned is that x 1 m P 1, P 2 I is. equal to x 1 h P 1 P 2 uNaught. This is an identity. not just equal to. this is always true. I can write it further if you pay attention to this that x1 m P1 comma P 2 and I is e of P 1 comma P2.
