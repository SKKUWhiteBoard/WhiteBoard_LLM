If you have a single photon, you always transfer momentum to the atom. But if you have two photons, the two momenta can cancel. This is actually a powerful method to avoid Doppler broadening in spectroscopy. For two-photon absorption, if the two laser beams are counter-propagating, the total momentum transfer is zero. If we arrange for the two photons to be absorbed from opposite directions, we reach the situation where the Dooppler shift is really zero. Coherence exists if there is a well-defined phase between two or more amplitudes. We can only observe it if else than the time integral over the energy difference between two levels. So therefore, when we are talking about coherence, how can we maintain longer coherence between energy levels? How can we create coherence in three level systems? This is actually intricately related to the fact that we can obtain more precise information about the energy levels. This is a very general introduction to coherence. The first form of coherence I want to discuss is the coherence involved in exciting atoms. of spontaneous emission. The system involves with the following operator, and this is the operator which completely describes the interaction of an atom with the electromagnetic field. The fact that we have a unitary evolution with this operator is 100% or 110% true. But this operator will actually lead to final states of the photon field, which may not have a specific phase. And this is actually what I want to work out with you in-- maybe even today, I think ten minutes may be enough-- what is really the information-- the phase information-- which we have in a photon, which has been spontaneously emitted. this is what we want to discuss on Wednesday. And this is what I referred to as the fundamental limit of spontaneous emission because we have not lost any coherence here. It's just if the phase is only imprinted in one particle-- one particle quantum physics sets us a limitation. Oh well, we can read out the phase phi. OK. Any question? To be continued on Monday.

Professor: In almost all cases when you address atoms, you do two photon courses because a photon is scattered. In reality, it is a two photon process and not two single photon processes, he says. Professor: If you have any doubts about some subtleties about how is light absorbed and emitted, the correct answer is always obtained from the two-photon picture. He then asks the audience to guess how many terms you would expect when you do the most basic light atom interaction.
