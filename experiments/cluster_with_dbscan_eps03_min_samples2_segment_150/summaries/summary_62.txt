we do is now we write the full equation and we sort it into sub equations corresponding to powers of lambda. So the lambda to the 0 equation is really easy. It's just H0 psi 0 is equal to E0 psi0. We could put n's on this. And this is the exactly solved problem. It says, yeah, you build your foundation from the Lambda to 0 equation, and it's just what you know already. And what you're going to do is use the psi n 0 and en 0 to do everything else. names that any educated physical chemist will know to say, oh, that's the Bixon-Jortner. And they're still alive. They're still doing beautiful stuff. But anyway, that is all I want to say today. I will do details on one mode and Morse oscillator in other sorts of things next time.

Lecturer: We can take a two by two Hamiltonian and exactly diagonalize it. In the next lecture, we'll look at non-degenerate perturbation theory. The next lecture will be on the interactions between normal modes of a polyatomic molecule and an ordinary, ordinary,harmonic oscillator. The lecture will also look at the effect of the structural parameters in this Hamiltonian on the energy levels and properties of the system. It will be presented by Robert Field, a spectroscopist and professor at MIT.
