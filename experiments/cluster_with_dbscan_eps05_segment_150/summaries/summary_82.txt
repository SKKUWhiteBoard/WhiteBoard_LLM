In almost all cases when you address atoms, you do two photon courses because a photon is scattered. In reality, it is a two photon process and not two single photon processes. If you have any doubts about some subtleties about how is light absorbed and emitted, the correct answer is always obtained from the two-photon picture. In this chapter on two photons, I'm completely focused on the resonant terms. But since four terms is still too many, I want to just tell you what is special about two photons. this is what we want to discuss on Wednesday. And this is what I referred to as the fundamental limit of spontaneous emission because we have not lost any coherence here. It's just if the phase is only imprinted in one particle-- one particle quantum physics sets us a limitation. Oh well, we can read out the phase phi. OK. Any question? To be continued on Monday.

It is exactly the same you have seen probably more than 100 times. People who want to measure fundamental constants-- the Rydberg constant-- want to compare lame shift with first principle QED calculations, sort of test the precision of quantum electrodynamics. This is the case for hydrogen. And, actually, with some advance in the numeric calculation of wave functions and all that, it may also be possible to do it with helium. I think so far it hasn't kind of-- helium has not replaced hydrogen.
