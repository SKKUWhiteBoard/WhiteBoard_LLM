Last week we looked at the we first saw our first magic formula which you've probably forgotten because it was a wonderful weekend so I'll remind you and um then from there we will uh resolve the spider problem and then uh we're going to solve uh the super magic formula. The Machinery I provided you is powerful enough to solve pretty much any kinematics problem because it's based purely on Geometry angular velocity is a kind of a madeup concept that just simplifies the math. yeah sorry and plus this thing okay we'll end now because Professor Socrates needs to take over this is it this is correct acceleration of P acceleration of Q with respect to B Oiler coris centripedal and you know why it doesn't go to zero because I'm not taking a Omega B cross a omeg B. I'm taking a omega B cross this whole term which is at 90Â° to a OmegaB got it got it? Yeah sorry and Plus this thingOkay we'llend now because professor Socrates need to takeover. but you need this correction term which is very beautiful done okay so this was the magic formula that I introduced in the last class how would we go about proving this anybody yeah do the math how wouldWe do theMath how would We prove this here's what we'll do let's prove it. I'm going to show you some videos showing you the coris force when I'm when you're done with these videos um you will a totally understand what the cholis not effect sorry not force cholis acceleration is and B have a headache rotating.
