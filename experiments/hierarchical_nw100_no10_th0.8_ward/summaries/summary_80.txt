Security Presidential Directive 54 establishing the CNCI is classified. Some details of the initiative have been made public through departmental press releases, speeches by executive branch leaders, and analysis offered by individuals who follow cybersecurity- and terrorism-related issues. Rather than serving as an overarching national strategy document with specific instructions for federal agency implementation activities, the C NCI is seen as a plan of action for programs and initiatives to be addressed at the operational and tactical level. It also delineates "an approach that anticipates future cyber threats and technologies" The Administration's 60-day review's near-term action plan calls for preparing and updating a new national strategy for securing communications and information infrastructure. Legislation proposed in S. 733 calls upon the President to present a national strategy within one year of the bill's enactment. Some have criticized the provision, which would give the President emergency control over public and private networks in the event of a crisis, and have argued that the bill is vague in addressing civil liberties protections. As this legislation is marked up, alternative proposals may be considered. President Obama announced the creation of a new cabinet-level position to coordinate cybersecurity strategy and policy across the federal government. This new "Cyber Coordinator" would report to the National Security Advisor and the Director of the National Economic Council. The new coordinator will have "regular access to the president" and will be considered a key member of the national security staff, while working closely with the economic team. Some duties will include improving federal agencies' computer security and coordinating with the White House and Congress. reorganizing the executive branch to better address cybersecurity-related issues, nor does it discuss the military's role in securing federal cyber networks. A common theme emerging from a review of the current proposals is the need for a current comprehensive national cybersecurity strategy. Critics maintain that without an overall government strategy and underlying policies to outline cybersecurity priorities, goals, and how to achieve them, executive organization and program funding may be a muddled process. Congress may consider drafting legislation that would outline a strategic security framework and priority areas. Since 2008, numerous executive branch, legislative, and think tank recommendations and proposals have been offered to address various aspects of ongoing and emerging cybersecurity issues. Complicating the issue is a lack of consensus on the definition of "privacy" in the context of the Internet. The White House 60-Day Cyberspace Policy Review is the most current attempts to frame the issue and are often referred to when discussions arise regarding how best to identify challenges and implement changes to the current U.S. approach to cybersecurity. Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has primary responsibility for reducing cyber vulnerabilities in the electrical grid. Congress directed NIST to lead the Department of Energy and other agencies in ensuring an interoperable, secure, and open energy infrastructure. NIST is also tasked to promote the development of key security standards and guidelines to support the implementation of and compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA; P.L. 107-347 ). The Department of Health also has responsibility for cyber security. for all federal government information systems and networks managed by the Department of Commerce. The section would require the Secretary of Commerce to develop and integrate a national licensing, certification, and periodic recertification program for cybersecurity professionals. The Director of the National Science Foundation to give priority to computer, information science, and engineering research to ensure support is provided to meet cybersecurity challenges. See under: Section 5—State and Regional Cybersecurity Enhancement Program; Part A—Creation and Support of Cybersecurity Centers. Department of Health and Human Services has recently adopted new interoperability standards for health care information technology. HHS is responsible for implementing privacy and security standards for electronic personal health information. Department of Homeland Security leads the cybersecurity coordination for non-military departments and agencies in the federal government. National Cyber Security Directorate works with private industry on a voluntary basis to promote safe cybersecurity practices. DHS is also home to the National Cyber security Center, a clearinghouse whose mission is to coordinate information from all agencies to help secure. A persistent set of issues has stymied significant progress in detecting and deterring existing threats and implementing effective safeguard measures. Issues that appear to continually challenge U.S. cybersecurity efforts include uncertainty of the geographic location of the perpetrators of cyber attacks. The introduction of new vulnerabilities to the nation's infrastructure from increasingly sophisticated threats is also a concern. Since 2008, a number of strategy and policy proposals have been offered that may assist in addressing the appropriate balance of relying on emerging technology and network-centric governance. appropriate balance of relying on emerging technology and network-centric governance while safeguarding critical infrastructure and control systems. Recent events such as the April 2007 cyber attacks on Estonia and cyber attacks during the 2008 Georgian incursion have served to increase awareness that cybersecurity is not just about protecting computers. The Obama Administration declared that U.S. critical information infrastructures are a strategic national asset in a May 29, 2009, speech by the President. Recognizing the importance of cyberspace over the past few years. provide a report that includes "a summary that ranks the risks within and across transportation modes, including vulnerability of a cyber attack" H.R. 1910 Chief Technology Officer Act of 2009 Status of bill : Introduced in House—referred to House Subcommittee on Information Policy, Census, and National Archives. Section 2 would require the Chief Technology officer to assess the impact of information technology and networked information technology systems. See under: Section 2—Office of the Chief technology Officer; Policy Planning, Analysis and Advice. the impact of information technology and networked information technology systems and applications on cybersecurity and personal privacy. advise the President on steps necessary to mitigate and manage security and privacy risks. The CTO would also be responsible for "fact-gathering, analysis, and assessment of the federal government's information technology infrastructures, information technology strategy, and use of technology" Other responsibilities would be ensuring "the security and Privacy of theFederal information technology infrastructure and networks" and "coordinating closely with other federal departments and agencies" security of classified networks. 8. Expand cyber education. 9. Invest in high-risk, high-reward research and development to ensure transformational change. 10. Define enduring deterrent technologies and programs. 11. Develop multi-pronged approaches to supply chain risk management (potential tampering within the production line and the risk associated with computer products and parts made outside the United States). 12. Defining the role of cybersecurity in private sector domains. A Cybersecurity Commission (the Commission) organized by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) was formed in 2008 to provide advice to the new Administration. Department of Defense has a number of programs designed to address vulnerabilities and threats to its own networks. Secretary Gates recently announced the creation of a new sub-unified command under the U.S. Strategic Command. This new command is to coordinate a unified approach to defending and securing military cyber networks. The December 2006 National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations (NMS-CO) guides computer network attack and defense principles. The Defense Industrial Base is a non-profit organization that provides information and support to the Department of Defense. The Defense Industrial Base (DIB) initiative provides a vehicle through which DOD and industry partners can better share information on cyber threats and defense practices. DOD also has established a Cybercrime Center (DC3) that assists in criminal, counterintelligence, counterterrorism, and fraud investigations by the Defense Criminal Investigative Organizations (DCIOs) and DOD counterintelligence activities. In addition to setting forensics standards, it provides training and testing laboratories for protection of defense information systems. Common themes often noted by many cybersecurity experts underscore a lack of transparency and dearth of defined departmental roles and responsibilities. Cybersecurity is a cross-cutting field that affects many government and non-governmental stakeholders. For example, the U.S. military views cyberspace as a warfighting domain as well as a force enabler. Conceptual and definitional differences among agencies make a unified government strategic approach to cybersecurity a challenge to coordinate. Some security observers are concerned about the federal government's present ability to first detect and then respond in a coordinated way to a cyber incident of major significance. The report does not discuss reorganizing the executive branch to better address cybersecurity-related issues. There is no single congressional committee that can claim primary jurisdiction over cyberspace. Neither is there a single executive agency or department with sole cybersecurity responsibility or commensurate authorities. As the President stated, "No single official oversees cybersecurity policy across the federal government. No single agency has the responsibility or authority to match the scope and scale of the challenge. Indeed, when it comes to cybersecurity, federal agencies have had to work together to address the problem" The White House has not commented on the President's comments. The Cyber Incident Annex to the National Response Plan of December 2004 describes many different authorities and policy documents to guide a response. Multiple federal information systems enterprise networks make a concerted strategic approach to network security even more difficult. Another cybersecurity difficulty for the government is balancing the protection of civil liberties and individual privacy protections with the desire for comprehensive security. The following table is designed to assist in identifying emerging emerging cyber threats. The table is intended to help you identify emerging cybersecurity threats that the government needs to address. as one of the President's key management priorities and establish performance metrics. Designate a privacy and civil liberties official in the NSC cybersecurity directorate. Convene appropriate interagency mechanisms to conduct legal analysis of priority cybersecurity issues. Initiate a national cybersecurity public awareness and education campaign. Develop U.S. government positions for an international cybersecurity policy framework. Prepare a cybersecurity incident response plan. Develop a framework for research and development strategies that focus on "game-changing" technologies that enhance security. and non-disclosure policies written into statutory frameworks that may not specifically address cybersecurity. Civil liberties is an area of concern for both Congress and privacy advocates. This may suggest to some that existing programs have emphasized securing networks before tackling the attendant issues such as freedom of speech, privacy, and civil liberties. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPA A) protects the privacy of individually identifiable health information in computerized insurance records. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (P.L. 106-102 ) and financial information for corporations or individuals. 1338, enacted November 12, 1999. Requires financial institutions to provide consumers with a privacy notice at the time the consumer relationship is established and annually thereafter. The privacy notice must explain the information collected about the consumer, where that information is shared, how that information was used, and the option to opt-out of sharing with third-party companies. See under: Disclosure of Nonpublic Personal Information (Financial Privacy Rule) for more information about the rule.

It is difficult to secure information infrastructures and their content without tradeoffs between security and the freedoms associated with the Internet. Many concerned about civil liberties fear that the executive branch will use its national security powers and national defense mandate as justification for encroaching on privacy. Others regard security measures, such as network traffic monitoring, as a violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that "no one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or home" Title I of the ECPA protects wire, oral, and electronic communications while in transit. It sets down requirements for search warrants that are more stringent than in other settings. Title II of theECPA, the Stored Communications Act (SCA) protects communication held in electronic storage, most notably messages stored on computers. 18 U.S.C. § 1030 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1984 Status of bill: P.L. 98-473 , 98 Stat. 2190 on October 12, 1984.

The bill would establish an Office of the National Cybersecurity Advisor. The position would serve the President as the principal advisor for all cybersecurity related matters. The bill would authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish a program to award grants to institutions of higher education for the Cybersecurity Education Enhancement Act of 2008. In section 4, under the "authority of Director of Office of Management and Budget to establish information security," the bill would have authorized the purchase of equipment to provide training in cybersecurity for professional development and degree programs. Presidency reports, Congress may consider other options when addressing current and emerging cyber risks to the nation. Additional options may include the following: Drafting legislation, strategy, and policies that take into account rapidly changing telecommunications and Internet-based technologies. Requiring the Department of Homeland Security annually to produce cybersecurity risk assessments for all nonfederal government entities with security responsibilities. Establishing a permanent Congressional Commission or Task Force that would assess and report to Congress successes and ongoing challenges in U.S. cybersecurity programs and activities. Congress has proposed legislation that would create new offices or positions, or give greater authority and direction to existing positions. It is unclear how proposals such as S. 778 to establish the Office of the National Cybersecurity Advisor fits with the administration's recently proposed Cyber Coordinator. Privacy and civil liberties concerns are not highlighted in recent congressional proposals. There are Internet privacy and non-disclosure policies written into statutory frameworks that may not attendant issues such as freedom of speech, privacy, and civil liberty protections as they pertain to the Internet. vulnerabilities and threats to the critical electric infrastructure and provide those to Congress as well as to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. S. 773 Cybersecurity Act of 2009 would require the President to develop and implement a comprehensive national cybersecurity strategy.
