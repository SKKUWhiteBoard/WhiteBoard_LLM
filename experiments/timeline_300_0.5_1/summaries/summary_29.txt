s gawan and the Green Knight um I believe this is the last piece where we don't know who the author is where it's unknown um I find the background interesting and that through textual Clues they're able to figure out who wrote it. I think straight off we can say that that's probably gow or sir GA however you want to say it okay then you have the villain or the dams and all as we come through the story try to put these titles with certain characters. you receive the the hunter the owner of the house the husband says whatever you receive you must give to me that seems kind of weird what possibly could he receive while he's there well we find out that the wife really kind of starts to come on to him over time okay real flirty she's she's a temptress okay very seductive uh she gives him a kiss what does he do when the husband comes home that day cuz the husband's going to share his his food share his everything with him as long as GNE you share with me and so he gets kissed. comes home and GNE does not give up the girdle because why would I give this this is going to save my life I'm not going to so he breaks his word okay he becomes a coward. The Green Knight comes he says by there said one on the bank above his head and you shall swiftly receive what I once swore to give you and so he comes and pretty much vaults over the the brook over the river. The Knight addresses him they have a little back and forth and he gets ready to hit him. good person away with the forbidden fruit you know something similar we could maybe connect uh down the road but it's very similar to to those so um so go and the green. I hopefully you enjoyed it um really story-wise we're done with knights uh. It's a very similar story to the one we did with the knights. It was a very different story but it was very similar. I hope you enjoyed the book. I'm glad you read it. I'll see you next week.
