User financing is one approach to financing federal programs or activities. Some excise taxes, however, can also be described as a form of user financing. The inspection fees vary in the way they are set, collected, used, and reviewed. The fees can only recoup authorized program costs to the extent that total reimbursable program costs do not exceed the rate caps prescribed in statute. The AQI fee statute grants the Secretary of Agriculture broad discretion to prescribe and collect fees sufficient to cover the cost of providing agricultural quarantine and inspection services.
