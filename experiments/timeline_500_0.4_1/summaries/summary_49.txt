AA and I are going to show you how to make vanilla extract so easy so yummy so good for all the things that you would use it for cakes whatever really really good isn't it. All you want for this is about 1 oz or roughly 30 G of vanilla beans so they'll be you know long Dobby whacker things and just cut them up into small pieces. Store this in a dry cool place and just as I said just shake once a day for at least a month preferably 2 to 3 months.
