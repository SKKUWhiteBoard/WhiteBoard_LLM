So, first we learned rationality, rationality axioms - completeness, reflexivity and transitivity. And when our when someoneâ€™s preference exhibit these three properties, what does it mean that he is able to completely rank all his choices all his potential choices, with also possibility, with possibility that there are more than one bundle at some ranks this is a possibility. One thing also I should add that he will be able to rank only if he has finite consumption set and also what we have learned that this will translate into a utility function. So, if these 3Axioms are satisfied you will get one utility function, in case, of finite consumption good, fine. Next we add I am not saying just continuity implies this, but continuity in addition to earlier three Axioms that we have learning, continuity. And what do we get? What we get is continuous utility function and now we do not have to impose the restriction that our consumption set is the consumption set of this individual is finite. Non-satiation would say that indifference curve has to be very thin, fine, it is clear. Convexity is not satisfied, where? In this zone, in this zone. Now tell me is it convex in this case preference of course, this is not the zone it is just poor drawing. Ajit: It is a partial, I did not define anything in the class, let us look at it. It is convex or it is not convex? Deveshvesh: Yes.
