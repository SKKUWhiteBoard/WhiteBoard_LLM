The meaning of the wave function is that the norm squared psi of x, norm squared, it's complex, dx is the probability of finding the particle- There's an n in their. Finding the particle-- in the region between x and x plus dx. OK? And third, the superposition principle. If there are two possible configurations the system can be in, which in quantum mechanics means two different wave functions that could describe the system given psi 1 and psi 2. All reasonable functions are equally reasonable as wave functions. There's no primacy in wave functions or in states. your memory. Gainst death and all oblivious enmity shall you pace forth. Your praise shall still find room, even in the eyes of all posterity. So no judgment arise till you yourself judgment arise. You live in this and dwell in lover's eyes. May your day be filled with love and poetry. Whatever state you're in, we will always love you. Signed, Jack Florian, James [INAUDIBLE]. [LAUGHTER] PROFESSOR: Thank you, sir. Every vector can be written as the sum of other vectors, right? So there's no such thing as a state which is not a superposition. In 3D, the wave function would be a function of all three positions x, y and z. Physics tells you this is a good model, and it works really well. And to the degree that it doesn't fit the data, it's wrong. There's no God given basis for the universe. This isn't something we derive. This is something we declare.
