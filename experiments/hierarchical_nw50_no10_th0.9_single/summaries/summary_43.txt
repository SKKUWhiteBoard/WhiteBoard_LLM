Before commercialization, air navigation services under government control faced increasing strains. In some instances, the country as a whole faced widespread fiscal problems. Commercialization was intended to relieve the government of a fiscal responsibility. According to ICAO, the ANSP should be encouraged to be as competitive, efficient, and cost-effective as any other commercial business. The UK established an authority before commercialization to develop one commercialized ANSP. The European Union’s “Single Sky Sky initiative” is planning to develop five commercialized AnSPs.
