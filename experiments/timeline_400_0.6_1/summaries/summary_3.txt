In today's video i'll show you the importance of de-gassing your bread dough as it's fermenting. No matter how gentle you try to handle your dough you will always de-gas it if only a little bit in today's comparison video we'll make 4 breads they will be made from the same dough but they will all be treated differently. The first one of the four breads will be left alone from the beginning of fermentation until it's baked. The final one will be folded shaped and degassed three times and we won't be fermenting them for the same amount of time. worst and you should not be making bread like that if you want to use this method it should be fermented for much longer and perhaps go in a higher tin at the end of the day it's all up to you make your bread the way you like it make it fit your style and taste experiment try different methods don't just follow recipes ask questions and if you ever get stuck check out more videos in the principles of baking playlists you might find some answers there so what do you think of degas thing do you degas your bread though let me know down in the comments and don't forget to read the blog post linked in the video description.
