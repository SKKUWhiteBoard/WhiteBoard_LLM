Federal agencies regulate the food production chain from farms to food manufacturers. State and local agencies primarily regulate food safety in retail food establishments. The agencies’ food safety authorities stem from 30 principal laws related to food safety. In fiscal year 2003, the four federal agencies spent nearly $1.7 billion on food safety-related activities. The majority of federal food safety inspection expenditures are directed toward USDA’s programs for ensuring the safety of meat, poultry, and egg products. In contrast, FDA accounts for more than half of the food safety education expenditures.
