Sir Gawain, nephew of King Arthur, was invited to a party at Camelot. A towering knight riding an emerald steed burst into the room and proposed a game. The Green Knight declared he would allow the bravest warrior present to attack him with his own axe. If they could strike him down, they would win his powerful weapon. However, the knight would be allowed to return that blow in one year and one day. Gawain tried to forget this bizarre vision, but despite the strangeness of the knightâ€™s game, he was determined to act honorably.
