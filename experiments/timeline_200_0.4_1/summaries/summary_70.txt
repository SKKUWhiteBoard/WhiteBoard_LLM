Professor: If you have a perturbative treatment, even if you carry to infinite order, you have, formally, divergences if you have resonant interaction. Professor: I want to show you what are the tools to treat those infinity source diverGences in a consistent and a systematic way.

Who of you have actually seen those kind of diagrammatic tricks and summation? A few, OK. So that's our agenda for at least the first part of today. And OK, we want to understand the time evolution of this system. Our tool is a time evolution operator. And at the end of the class on Monday, I told you, well, let's simplify things. Let's get rid of those temporal integrations and multiple integrals by simply doing a Fourier transform. processes. OK, any last questions? Well then, let's enjoy the open house with incoming graduate students, and I'll see you on Monday. I'll be back on Monday to talk to you about the classes we'll be teaching next year.
