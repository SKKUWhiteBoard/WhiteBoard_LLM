In this video I'm going to be going over lung oscilation specifically the sites of where you osculate. We're going to go over some audio clips of normal breath sounds and where you should hear them at CU that's a big thing. We'll also go over abnormal breath sounds. In the next video I'll be performing an assessment on a patient and show you how to listen with your stethoscope to these sides. I'll also give you some landmarks to make your job easier so you'll know what intercostal space correlates with which lobe of the lung.
