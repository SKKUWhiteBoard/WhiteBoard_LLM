the same connection. The pion here is spin 0, and if you discuss this in the rest frame of the pion, the electron and the positron fly off in opposite directions, which means that the spin doesn't in align to 0. So that's why this is highly suppressed. It's not 0, because you can find-- you can put [INAUDIBLE] into a rest frame, where you're just basically looking at both particles from one side that was coming to you, and in that case, it's allowed. In quantum mechanics, the spin of a particle with a vector is quantized. You find that it's square root of f times s plus 1 in units of h-bar. If you want to get an eigenvalue with the physical state of particles, which axis are the right ones to choose-- or, sensible? There's no right and wrong in this discussion. It's not 0, because you can put [INAUDIBLE] into the rest frame, where you're just basically looking at both particles from one side.
