okay so welcome to the last lecture of this course here in this winter term and what we discussed so far in the course were mainly the so-called backends or optimization engines or probablistic estimation techniques. Today I would like to give a very very of course brief short overview about front ends and one important aspect inside successful front ends on how to determine if a constraint is likely to be a correct one so we are still interested in avoiding to add roam constraints although we've learned that we there are techniques which can deal with outliers in the data Association.
