Bogdan Fedeles: Today we're going to be talking about Problem 2 of Problem Set 4. We'll be discussing in detail the mechanism of HMG-CoA synthase, a key enzyme in central metabolism. The enzyme is responsible for making the five carbon building blocks from which all sterols, such as cholesterol and steroid hormones, are made. The reaction will start by forming this thioester between the acetoacetyl- CoA carbons and the cysteine in the active site of the enzyme.
