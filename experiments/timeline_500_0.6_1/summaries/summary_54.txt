foreign I'm really excited especially for this lecture which is a very special lecture on robust and trustworthy deep learning by one of our sponsors of this amazing course themus AI. Themis AI is a startup actually locally based here in Cambridge our mission is to design advance and deploy the future of AI and trustworthy AI specifically. I'm especially excited about today's lecture because I co-founded Themis right here at MIT right here in this very building in fact this all stemmed from really the incredible scientific innovation and advances that we created right here. Sadhana is a machine learning scientist here at Themis Ai and the lead TA of the course this year. She'll be teaching us more about specifically the bias and the uncertainty Realms of AI algorithms. Sadhana: Over the past decade we've seen some tremendous growth in artificial intelligence across safety critical domains in the Spheres of autonomy and Robotics. But there's another question that we need to ask which is where are these models in real life a lot of these Technologies were innovated five ten years ago but you and I don't see them in our daily lives. We tend to over sample samples with darker skin color and therefore the model learns them better and tends to do better on them. We can use the above algorithmic bias mitigation method to try and solve these problems and more so we just went through how to mitigate some forms of bias in artificial intelligence and where these Solutions may be applied. We talked about a foundational algorithm that Themis uses that UL will also be developing today and for the next part of the lecture we'll focus on why uncertainty is important and how we can estimate it.
