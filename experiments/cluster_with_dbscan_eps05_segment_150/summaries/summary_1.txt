CASEY RODRIGUEZ: We proved two theorems last time, and we used them for-- and we had a couple of applications of them. The first was that a sequence converges to x if and only if the limit as n goes to infinity of the absolute value of xn minus x goes to 0. And then we also had the squeeze theorem, that if you have three sequences-- a sub n, b subn, and x sub n. such that the limit as k goes to infinity of x sub n sub k equals liminf of xsub n. And again, this is a subsequence of a convergent sequence, so it's convergent and convergence of the same thing, L. So that implies that this thing is equal to L. And therefore, the limsup and the liminf equal each other, and they also equal the limit of the original sequence. That is the end of the proof of this theorem. we've only defined what it means to take a real number to an integer power, but-- and n-th roots. So using that, we can then define how totake a real numbers to a rational power. All of that is just to say that what we've done up to now-- these things actually do make sense. You don't need the exponential and the logarithm to make sense of a positive real number. OK? But we're just going to use the basic properties of exponents throughout all this.
