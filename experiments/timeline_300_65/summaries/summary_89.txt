RAFAEL JARAMILLO: Today we're going to discuss the many D's of thermodynamics. We'll talk about lowercase d, lowercase Greek d, and uppercase Greek D. He'll draw a 3D visualization of how the entropy for a given phase might vary with pressure and temperature at a fixed composition. Jaramillo: The most common transformations that we talk about are transformations that take place at constant pressure and constant temperature, isobaric and isothermal transformations. is a function of those independent variables that measures the transformation quantity for the transformation between two different phases. For example, in the case of water, the quantity of water in the solution is the ratio of the water volume to the volume of the solution. For the example, the total water volume is the sum of the volumes of the solutions of the two phases. The total water content is the product of the proportions of the different water volumes.
