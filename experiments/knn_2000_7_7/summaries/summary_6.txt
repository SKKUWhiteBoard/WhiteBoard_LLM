I want to start by sort of recapping what we talked about last Tuesday um I apologize that was kind of a rough introduction that was uh that was me making a couple of last minute edits that probably hurt more than they helped so I want to just review um convolutions and and the architecture of a CNN to make this more clear and put it into perspective how it relates to um just standard um dense neural networks I think it's fine. When you have images and a CNN you can simply just do convolutions instead of your normal matrix multiplication um which is demonstrated up here. and mobile nuts for Edge Computing and things like that. You want to drastically reduce the number of computations that you want to do yep that is basically everything for today thank you guys for coming oh and there will also be a quiz there will Also be a quizz at least is there a homework position closer or not [Music] um and do next Friday [ music] thank you for sure. And next Friday we'll be talking about how to use Edge Computing in the real world. We'll also talk about how you can use Edge computing in the classroom.
