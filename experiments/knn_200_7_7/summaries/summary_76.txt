So, the first we learned rationality, rationality axioms - completeness, reflexivity and transitivity. And when our when someoneâ€™s preference exhibit these three properties, what does it mean that he is able to completely rank all his choices all his potential choices, with also possibility, with possibility that there are more than one bundle at some ranks this is a possibility. One thing also I should add that he will be able to rank only if he has finite consumption set and also what we have learned that this will translate into a utility function. So, from here we learned that indifference curve has to be downward sloping.
