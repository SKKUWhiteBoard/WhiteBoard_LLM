Peter Solovits: I got a call from a committee of the National Academy of Science, Engineering, and Medicine. He says they convened a meeting to talk about the set of topics that I've listed here. Solovitsch: They talked about AI and decision making, privacy and informed consent in an era of big data, science curricula for law schools, emerging issues, and science, technology, and law.
