BCBP has undertaken efforts to focus its enforcement on selecting and inspecting the highest-risk incoming cargo, while enabling legitimate cargo to be cleared in a timely manner. BCBP relies on the use of threat assessments and actionable intelligence, the ability of inspectors to quickly discover or sense an unlawful cargo, and nonintrusive inspection technology to detect potentially harmful contraband. We are currently reviewing how BCBP is targeting cargo for further inspection and how such cargo is inspected at ports. Separating high-risk cargo from low- or no- risk cargo is extremely important to BCBP.
