more because it doesn't make sense from a marginal revenue point of view. This gap, the difference between the price and the marginal cost at this rational quantity for this firm in an imperfectly competitive market to produce, economists would refer to this as an inefficiency, inefficiency. Folks are willing to pay more than that marginal cost, but you still have no motivation to produce more. Because if you produce more, even though the price is higher, your marginal revenue is going to be below themarginal cost. In a perfectly competitive market, the firm is a price-taker. No matter how many units they produce, they're just going to be able to get that same market price. A firm in an imperfectly competitive market will have their own firm-specific demand curve. The price that they get in the market is higher than the marginal cost and the marginal revenue at that point. Folks are willing to pay more than that marginal cost, but you still have no motivation to produce more.
