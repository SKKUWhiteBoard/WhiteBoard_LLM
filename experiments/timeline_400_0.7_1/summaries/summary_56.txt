The US Supreme Court is the highest federal court in the United States. The Constitution doesn't specify any qualifications, so a president can nominate any individual to serve. Most presidents nominate individuals who broadly share their ideological view. So far, six justices have been foreign-born, at least one never graduated from high school, and another was only 32 years old when he joined the bench. The Senate Judiciary Committee votes to send the nomination to the full Senate with a positive or negative recommendation, often reflective of political leanings. approve, it's by a simple majority vote, with ties broken by the vice president. With the Senate's consent, the president issues a written appointment, allowing the nominee to complete the final steps to take the constitutional and judicial oaths. In doing so, they solemnly swear to administer justice without respect to persons and do equal right to the poor and the rich. This job is for life, barring resignation, retirement, or removal from the court by impeachment. Of the 112 justices who have held the position, not one has yet been removed from office as a result of an impeachment.
