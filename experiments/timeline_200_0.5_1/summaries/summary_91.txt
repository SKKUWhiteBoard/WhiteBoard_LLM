Aristotle was born 384,15 years after the trial of Socrates. He was sent by his father to go to college. Unlike most of you, Aristotle did not spend four years at the Platonic Academy. He remained attached to it for the next 20, until the death of Plato. Unlike his intellectual godfather, Socrates, who wrote nothing but conversed endlessly, Aristotle wrote disciplined and thematic treatises on virtually every topic. He collected constitutions, 158 of them in all, from throughout the ancient world. animal. "That man" he says "is much more a political animal than any kind of bee or herd animal is clear" Why is it clear? "For we assert," he says, "nature does nothing in vain and man alone among the animals has speech" In other words, he seems to be saying that it is speech or reason, logos, that is able to both distinguish and create certain moral categories, such as the advantageous, the harmful, the just and unjust, and things of this kind. Aristotle says man is political not because we have some biological impulse or instinct that drives us to participate in politics, but because we are possessed of the power of speech. It is a reason or speech, not instinct, that makes us political, he says. To say it's natural for us to do so is not to say we engage in political life spontaneously and avidly, as you might say spiders spin webs or ants build anthills, he writes. The power to know is our ability to recognize, by sight, members of the same polis or city.
