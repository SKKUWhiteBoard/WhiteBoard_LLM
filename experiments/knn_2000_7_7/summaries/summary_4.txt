When you do not have unlimited amount of everything, you will have to make a choice, what to produce? In what quantity you should produce a particular good. Allocation is nothing but assignment, allotment, share, but in economics we are more technical about this particular term allocation. So, allocation here means solving these three fundamental or basic questions of economics, and the first question is what to produced? The second is how to produce and the third is for whom to produce. And depending on who makes these decisions we have different form of economy, who make these decisions.
