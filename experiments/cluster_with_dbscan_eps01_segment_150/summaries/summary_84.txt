the results for "bad" using cosine distance in cell 12 and Jaccarddistance in cell 13. And I would just like to say that these neighbors don't look especially intuitive to me. It does not look like this analysis is revealing really interesting semantic information. But don't worry, we're going to correct this. We're going. to start to massage and stretch and bend our vector space models. And we will see much better results for these neighbor functions and everything else as we go through that material. Part 3 in our series on distributed word representations. We're going to be talking about vector comparison methods. To try to make this discussion pretty intuitive, I'm going to ground things in this running example. On the left, I have a very small vector space model. We have three words, A, B, and C. And you can see graphically that B and C are pretty close together. And A is kind of lonely down here in the corner, the infrequent one.
