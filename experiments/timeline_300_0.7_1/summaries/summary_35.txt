In this video, we're going to compute some useful quantities for the exponential random variable. The CDF of x is the probability that X is less than or equal to little x. We use the standard formula, which is minus infinity to infinity t times fx of t dt. For this, if you evaluate the balance, 0 makes this 0, and 0 to get 1 over. And so the expectation is 1 over lambda, and so the variance is part c, so OK, so far so good. rule, 3 times 1 minus e to the minus Lambda z squared. Then the derivative of negative e to  the minus lambda z, that's just Lambda e to z. This is the PDF we were looking for. We're looking for the PDF of w, which is the min of x1 and x2. So let's try this as a similar approach. Try the same thing, actually. See if it works. So w, w,. w, W, w, min, less than or equal to w. So it's going to be-- Notice the similarity between this and this. The only difference is this has a 2 lambda in there. That means that w is an exponential random variable with rate 2 Lambda. You can also take the derivative of this and find that you get this. OK, so we're done with the problems. We computed some interesting quantities for the exponentialRandom variable in this. So then the PDF isgoing to be an exponential, whatever it is for an exponential.
