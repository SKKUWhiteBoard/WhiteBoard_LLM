Albert Meyer: Random variables are an absolutely fundamental concept in probability theory. He says in the bigger number game, two teams pick two different integers between 0 and 7 inclusive. The other team sees these two pieces of paper whose other side has different numbers written on them. Meyer: Team 1 picks these two numbers, but they have to pick a low number that's less than a high number. The probability that you win these games is 4/7, because there's a 1/2 that you'll win the time. the game is that Team 2 wins if they wind up with the larger number. If you were lucky enough to guess the right threshold between low and high, you're going to win. So the probability that you win, given the middle case occurs, is 1. Now, in case H, that's the case where Z happens to be chosen greater than or equal to the high number that Team 1 shows. Well, in that case, Z just isn't telling you anything. So what's going to happen is that both numbers are going to look high to you because they're both less than. 1 apart, they can't have the same number on both pieces of paper. So one of them has to be less than the other. OK, now we can consider three cases of what happens with your strategy. The most interesting case is the middle case. That is, when your Z, which was chosen at random, happens to fall in the interval between low and high. And that means that you'll win, if and only if, you happen to turn the low card over first.
