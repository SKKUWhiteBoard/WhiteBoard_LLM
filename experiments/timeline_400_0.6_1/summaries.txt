John ESSIGMANN: I measure my blood sugar at different times during the day. Gluconeogenesis technically means new synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors. The medicine I take is called Metformin. It has a number of targets, but one of them is one of the enzymes, called PEPCK, Pyruvate Carboxykinase, that's in the gluconeogenic pathway. The liver provides a constant stream of glucose to these organs that absolutely require it, like our brain. the night, is to take this drug that will prevent the switch to produce more and more sugar by gluconeogenesis. The drug will stop the switch from producing more sugar to producing less sugar. It will also prevent the production of more sugar from the body's own production of sugar. This is called the 'gluconeogenesis inhibitor' and is used in the treatment of diabetes and obesity. It is a drug that stops the switch between the two processes from occurring. It also prevents the body from producing too much sugar.

In this lecture, we introduce and develop the concept of independence between events. If I tell you that a certain event A has occurred, this will generally change the probability of some other event B. In such a case, we say that events A and B are independent. We will then proceed to define the independence of a collection of more than two events. Finally, we will close with an application in reliability analysis and with a nice puzzle that will serve as a word of caution about putting together probabilistic models.

In today's video i'll show you the importance of de-gassing your bread dough as it's fermenting. No matter how gentle you try to handle your dough you will always de-gas it if only a little bit in today's comparison video we'll make 4 breads they will be made from the same dough but they will all be treated differently. The first one of the four breads will be left alone from the beginning of fermentation until it's baked. The final one will be folded shaped and degassed three times and we won't be fermenting them for the same amount of time. worst and you should not be making bread like that if you want to use this method it should be fermented for much longer and perhaps go in a higher tin at the end of the day it's all up to you make your bread the way you like it make it fit your style and taste experiment try different methods don't just follow recipes ask questions and if you ever get stuck check out more videos in the principles of baking playlists you might find some answers there so what do you think of degas thing do you degas your bread though let me know down in the comments and don't forget to read the blog post linked in the video description.

Of the nearly 11,000 amendments proposed in the centuries since, only 27 have succeeded as of 2016. The founders of the United States were trying to create a unified country from thirteen different colonies. For an amendment to even be proposed, it must receive a two-thirds vote of approval in both houses of Congress. To actually change the Constitution, the amendment must be ratified by three-quarters of all states. The result of such high thresholds is that, today, the American Constitution is quite static.

Third degree heart blocks also known as a complete heart block this type of heart block is the worst of all blocks. Electrical signal from the atria isn't making it to the ventricles. The person could be born with it so it could be congenital or the person has severe heart disease or they have a myocardial infarction or they're taking some type of medication that they become toxic on like digoxin. What is the treatment for a heart valve problem now what is the treating for a third degree heart block? third degree heart block well with this your patient's usually going to have some signs and symptoms because whenever the heart is beating like this those ventricles and atria they're really being independent of each other it's not going to perfuse your body so you're going tohave a low cardiac output. Some treatment that can be given to that patient is that atropine can be administered to help that heart pump more efficiently or the patient could be connected to a temporary pacemaker which will again get that heart beating correctly. Eventually the patient will need a permanent pacemaker implanted.

The final contest, which is due tonight, is to design an agent that plays together with another agent to try to collect food pellets while not getting eaten by ghosts. So submissions for that, your last chance to submit are tonight at midnight. And on Thursday in lecture, we'll discuss the results. So today's lecture, as well as Thursday's lecture,. will be mostly on advanced applications. We will not quiz you on these application lectures, on the final exam, or anything like that. It's more meant to give you more perspective. Today's state-of-the-art in Go is that there are computer players better than the best human players. But for a game like Go, this is actually pretty hard to do. And why? Let's take a look at chess. It's much bigger than Tic-Tac-Toe. You're not going to easily compute all possible scenarios in chess. Hasn't been done yet. For Go, here's what it looks like. The brushing factor is much larger. And the ideal expansion scenario can reduce the size of the tree by square rooting it, making it half as deep. Still too much. With reasonable compute power, it traverses the whole tree. Even with alpha beta pruning, I don't think that'll happen anytime soon. It could be that by using human knowledge, you're in some kind of based enough attraction. For a local [? optim, ?] that maybe not as good as another one that might be out there. It also depends on how much randomness you have in your exploration. If you have enough randomness, then initialization will have much less effect than if you have limited randomness. Researchers have developed a way to teach helicopters to fly autonomously. The system is based on a hidden Markov model. It can be used to learn new skills, such as how to fly a helicopter in a certain way. The researchers hope to use the system to teach Go players to play the game without knowing any prior knowledge of the game or how to do certain maneuvers in a particular way. Back to Mail Online home.Back to the page you came from.. The team has developed a system that can teach a helicopter to fly in a specific way, using a hidden model. the helicopter to follow a path that's not flyable. So what if we collect paths from a human pilot and then ask the helicopter to fly those paths? Well, we could learn the trajectory from these as noisy observations. What methodology do we have for that? Hidden Markov models. We can now penalize our award, penalized for deviating from the target. And then we can run reinforcement learning in simulation, let's say, in this learn simulator to find a good controller and run it on the real helicopter. is a separate linear feedback controller for each time slice. If there is no wind, you can actually just run the linear feedback control. It will be fine. But if there's some wind gusts that could throw you off, you want to use the value functions and the two second look ahead against those value functions to do the controls. Training a unified policy across the entire space might work. It might take some work, exactly, figuring out how to do it. It could be interesting to revisit that now and see what the current understanding of how to train these networks. In 2015, there was the Doppler Robotics Challenge, which was held in Pomona, just east of Los Angeles. The robot had to, essentially, drive a car or walk, but driving the car was recommended. It turned it's very complex to get a robot to do that. The thing is modeling these situations proved even harder than modeling helicopters, because your sensing needs to understand whether or not you're already making contact, and making contact or not. You can be very close, but not have contact. It's a very subtle thing. Four cars finished the 150-mile Berkeley autonomous car race in 2005. What goes onto the cars? There is IMU, like right on a helicopter, a lot of computers. Lasers, where you shoot out laser beams. And based on how long it takes them to get back, you know how far away the nearest obstacle is in that direction. Cameras, radar, control screen, steering motor, usually, you would have a high level planner choosing a path and then a low level controller following that path. A camera will be better at that than a LIDAR. Self-supervision is a trick that's very widely used to reduce labeling efforts. In urban environments, there's even more need to recognize, not just road versus not road. A lot of progress has been made this is video from 2013. This was before deep neural networks were heavily used for this kind of thing. It's only getting better to recognize what's in scenes, thanks toDeep neural networks. The devil is really in the details, in the long term. tail of special events that can happen when you're driving. You can measure progress by just demo videos, which is one way, and it gives you some kind of feel for what's going on. Another way to measure progress is to see how are these cars doing relative to human drivers. If you test in California, you have to report this data to the DMV. It's a number of events per 1,000 miles driven. Red there is human fatalities. Then yellow is human injuries. In green is the Google slash [? wave ?] mode disengagement. so many decisions. If they're gigantic, use a lot of power. That's a problem. Let's see what we can do to build smaller networks to make decisions. What else did we not cover yet? Personal robotics. I want to spend a little more than two minutes on that, so let's keep that for Thursday. that's it for today. Bye.

So let us say we are talking about price of good 1 has gone up substitution, income these are the effects and overall. When P 1 goes up subs because of substitution effect x 1 will. Come down. And for income also because of income effect it will come down. While inferior goods substitution effect quantity demanded would come down while income effect is Up. Up. Can you give me an example its very very difficult to find Giffen good in real life why? Sir, like if Gucci is a brand and it is. Prices comes down by significant amount. No one could buy a Gucci, it is it is at that level only because of it is prices. for meat and other food products. To get enough calorie; they had to increase the consumption of potato. So, in that case if this story is true then potato is Giffen good ok, but the problem is with this the second requirement that income effect is larger than the substitution effect. Typically this is not fulfilled that is why we have very-very hard time getting finding out, figuring out Giffsen good in an economy. It's very hard to find out what's good.

Mark was afraid well who knows uh may be different I don't want people know what I said in the past it might be unsafe. His view was that Charles II then had violated his trust and it altered the form of the Constitution and therefore the government was dissolved. and who does not have the right to vote and what the conditions on it are maybe we want to free it from that of course what I'm thinking of eventually um is that that that would be one motivation for introducing an idea like the origal position that say it's a way of conceiving how con power might be exercised. No point in criticizing someone for something they didn't intend to do okay well I think it's stop so remember there's no class here Monday so the next class here will be next Friday.

Summary:
David Kaiser: particle cosmology is a new subfield within physics. He says it studies the smallest units of matter, the fundamental forces and elementary constituents of matter. Kaiser: The field is doing pretty well these days by other measures. Its annual budget just within the U.S. is on the order of $1 billion a year, roughly, he says. It is really a booming, booming subject of study, Kaiser says. The field literally didn't even exist 45 years ago, he adds. In the 1960s, a number of high-energy theorists were trying to put together these highly symmetric models to account for things like the nuclear forces. These nuclear forces are self-evidently of short range, unlike gravitation or electromagnetism, which, in principle, can extend arbitrarily long distances. The nuclear forces really exert themselves across nuclear dimensions, very tiny fraction of the size even of a single atom, let alone macroscopic scales. The question of mass turns out to have been on many specialists minds in the 1950s and '60s, but as embedded in quite different-sounding conversations. In Einstein's theory, the unit strength of gravity is set by some universal constant, the same constant G. So what Brans and Dicke do is say, well, let's replace G by 1 over phi. So now 1 over G becomes phi in the Lagrangian or in the action for gravitation. In principle phi, the local strength ofgravity could change across time and space. If this field phi could vary, if it, in principle, it could be changing eta over space or over time, then they also knew they had to take into account within this total energy budget. Jeffrey Goldstone was among the first to show that a certain kind of characteristic shape for a potential energy function could be used to break the symmetry of the nuclear forces. Goldstone introduced a new hypothetical form of matter, the Higgs field, which acts like it has a molasses-like mass. He says this new field stretches through all of space and time, and all the rest of matter interacts with it. If these other force-carrying particles get stuck at some non-zero value of their field, it actually is stuck at a non- zero value of its field. Geoffrey Goldstone: Brans-Dicke field phi was the first quantitative alternative to Einstein's general theory of relativity in nearly half a century. He says it offered a way to maintain the symmetries of the nuclear forces and keep them short-range. Goldstone says the Higgs field, the separate field Phi, was tremendously exciting for the reasons he was emphasizing a moment ago. The sets of ideas were published to very wide acclaim in their own separate fields as early as 1961, he says. In 1979, two separate theorists working independently of each other suggested that the two fields might be literally the same, not just comparable or worth considering side by side. So it's not that they're somehow intrinsically totally separate or different from each other. Instead, their status, really, is historical. How people assess them or what they thought they were good for was changing over time. And so what had changed? That's what we'll pick up in the next part of this three-part series. more than just the letter that they chose. There was a lot of what we might have considered similarities. And yet, the two sets of ideas really were treated so separately. By the end of the '70s, things did not look very good for Brans-Dicke gravity experimentally. In fact, Einstein's theory was not highly favored, and that's why everyone else started paying attention on the gravity side of the field. So we might wonder, well, was it changes in data? Did experiments force a new evaluation? Evidence for the Higgs-Boson wasn't found until July of 2012, or maybe December of 2011, the first hints experimentally-- well past the period we're talking about. The main story that's mostly given-- I alluded to this in the very beginning of today's class-- is actually hearkens to changes in ideas. Two of these sets of ideas, in particular, are usually pointed to-- and they came in rapid fire in 1973 and 1974. The first of them is called asymptotic freedom. That suggests the behavior of quarks and gluons might be really different at very high energies. vast majority of those came really in the later '70s, in the wake of these pedagogical reforms. So remember that big report comes out in 1972. You start seeing curricular changes as early as '73, '74. By '75, '76, '77, you start seeing, in some sense, the market respond with many textbooks being really rushed into print. Some of these textbooks were basically mimeographed lecture notes. Now there's very, very fancy books published in a more typical way. You see really a rush to get more books on that subfield in particular. a continuous unitary symmetry, which is like saying you could rotate the electron field by any continuum amount, and the equations remain unchanged. The photon only has to mop up a relatively simple symmetry, the U1 gauge symmetry. Whereas SU2 was what I was pointing to when I was referring to the weak nuclear force. That's a discrete symmetry. It's a more complicated symmetry structure. And that's the symmetry group that these force-carrying particles-- the W and the Z particles-- are invented to enforce. broken at lower energies, they take on different features. It's another example of spontaneous symmetry breaks. So gravity gets stuck being weak because its local strength is arising through the Brans-Dicke field getting in a symmetry-breaking phase. And only in the broken-symmetry phase do we experience a phenomena that we are used to. That's right. And that's super cool and fun and lots more to be said about that. But that is, indeed, where that nomenclature came from. physicist with whom he accidentally wound up swapping apartments happens to have been immersed in gravitation and cosmology. By the mid to late '70s, he's now asking questions at this interface between his formal training in high-energy particle theory and this new hobby interest. He writes his version of his broken-symmetric gravity to suggest very creatively but tentatively that the Brans-Dicke field and the Higgs field might be identical. It was actually that second version that becomes more and more common. Alan Guth: Few physicists today think Brans-Dicke theory of gravity best describes our Universe. He says interest in the field grew even as it was getting experimentally less and less favored. Guth: New generation of theorists trained to work at this interface. They had all kinds of potential roles to play in new work that we'll look at together next time on inflation, he says. "We'll have more opportunities to make fun of Alan Guth, which is what's in it for me" soon, everyone. Soon, everyone will be able to play together again. Soon.

Summary:
Judy Hoyt: We're going to discuss the accurate control and placement of active dopant regions through a process called dopant diffusion. The placement of those regions determines many of the so-called short channel characteristics of MOSFETs that we'll talk about. The doping of other materials, not just the silicon itself, but of the polysilicon gate affects things like gate depletion and limits how well the gate voltage controls the channel potential, Hoyt says. The equation numerically, essentially, for an arbitrary doping profile is 1 over the integral of the carrier concentration minus the background concentration. Dopant diffusion is described by Fick's first law, which describes how the flux or the flow of dopant depends upon the doping gradient. When the concentration gradient goes to 0, essentially, the dopant or the atoms are uniformly distributed, say, in the solid, and the flow would stop. Later on, we'll talk about the more atomistic diffusion mechanisms and effects of dopants in the silicon lattice. We're going to consider macroscopic first-- macroscopy models for diffusion.

Summary:
Machine learning is about how to acquire a model and acquire the parameters of a model, from data and experience. In the next few lectures, we're going to work through a sequence of different takes on machine learning that are going to highlight different subsets of the big ideas on this topic. We'll see today exactly how data kind of goes through the mill and gets turned into a model. And we'll see more in-depth examples and more structured examples of these kinds of problems later on when we talk about applications. There's tons of classification tasks. It's probably the most widely-used application of machine learning. Classification, you're given inputs, you predict labels, or classes, y. Medical diagnosis could be classifications. Fraud detection could be, think about your credit card company. Automatic essay grading, auto grading, this can be a machine learning problem.. Review sentiment. Here's a bunch of reviews of my product. Which ones are good? which ones are bad? Have they gotten better in the past 10 days since the new announcement? And so on. In model-based classification, rather than directly learning from errors that you make in the world from experience, think like reinforcement learning model-free. The Naive Bayes assumption is an extremely radical assumption as far as probabilistic models go, but for classification, it turns out to be really effective and it goes something like this. You build a model where the output label and the input features are random variables. There's going to be some connections between them, and maybe some other variables too that might help you build a better model. word depends on the class and also the previous word. This Is a better model of language. If you started, if you did prediction in this, and you cranked out a pretend document, it would look significantly more like a real email than if you just did a bag of words. Will it be more accurate for classification? It really depends. In general, it will be a little more accurate, but at a cost of having significantly more complicated conditional probabilities to estimate. All right. Let's take a break now. We are now into the machine learning section which means we are done with the spooky Halloween time ghost-busting section. But I have candy. Machine learning theory is based on trying to say something precise about the connection between data and training. The main worry is that you over-fit. The principle of empirical risk minimization goes something like this. We would like to find the model, classifier, whatever, that does the best-- whatever the best means-- on our true test distribution. We don't actually know that true distribution. So how do you make progress? Well, what you do know is you have a training set. And you can't pick the parameters which are going to do best. over time, spam classification doesn't actually look like a standard classification problem because it's adversarial. Here's an example of this tradeoff. In general, we're going to do discrete classification. But for this example, let's imagine the thing we're trying to do is to fit a curve to this data. So it's about-- you can always fit your data more. It's about fitting your data to the point where the patterns that you are capturing are ones which generalize to test. in a corner where there's no number. This is an example of over-fitting, because this probability versus this probability, that is about the idiosyncrasies of the samples I have in my data. What do you think, in my training data for ham versus spam, things with the highest odds ratio for ham would be? These are things that are significantly more likely for ham than for spam. Words like Gary, except when I look at my data, it's actually a mess. It turns out, there are a bunch of words in this data which occur in spam once, and in ham zero. of over-fitting, where the exact details of which sample points you drew when you collected your data get captured in a way that doesn't generalize. To do better, we need to smooth, or regularize, our estimates. In Naive Bayes probabilistic models, over- fitting usually shows up as sampling variance. For other methods, it's going to show up in totally other ways. The exact mechanics of over-fits are going to vary from model to model. The maximum likelihood estimate, or relative frequency estimate, is a way to estimate the likelihood of an outcome. The more samples you draw, the more accurate your estimate will be. But in practice, you need some smoothing to prevent things like zeros in these estimates. This is actually due to a philosopher who kind of worried about things like things like how do I estimate the probability the sun will rise in the morning? Every morning it's risen, so far so far. Every morning the sun's risen. So I need some way of incorporating that into my estimate. In a real classification problem, you have to smooth if you're going to use Naive Bayes. This is the top of the odds ratios for ham on the left, and favoring spam on the right. If you see money, that's a good sign that it's spam. There are some things that indicate ham. This looks like general English text. What is going on there? Helvetica vs. Verdana. If I crank down k, I fit more, and so I now have a dial which can trade off the amount of fitting against generalization. In general, your model is going to make errors. In spam classification, we found out that it wasn't enough to just look at words, you've got to look at other sort of metadata from the ecosystem. For digit recognition, you do sort of more advanced things than just looking at pixels, where you look at things like edges and loops and things like that. You can add these as sources of information by just adding variables into your Naive Bayes model, but we'll also talk in the next few classes about ways to add these more flexibly.

We're gonna look at how consumer surplus producer surplus and total surplus are going to change when we introduced the idea of trade in allowing Chile's copper manufacturer producers to trade on the global market. The world price of copper is five thousand four hundred and forty dollars a ton. Because the world price is higher than the price in Chile Chile will export copper. There is a shift of some of the consumer surplus is going to go to the producer surplus.

Thiazide tells us that this medication works in the early part of the distal convoluted tubule that's found within this nephron. This transporter is called the sodium chloride co-transporter and it is considered a cyanide sensitive transporter so hence why this drug works so well. While loop diuretics are a lot more effective than a thiazide diuretic but the thiazid does provide a nice diuresis effect. They're less effective in patients who have a compromised GFR a go merrill ER filtration rate.

Future John Green tells you that in a stunning turn of events the 2020 presidential election will be won by - Harry Styles. I know that he's English and under 35 but we're going to change the constitution to make it possible. Because… that’s how much we love Harry Styles in 2020. The Major Recession of 2008 - 2012. A mixture of public and private activities that tilted towards short-term economic thinking, speculation and irresponsible spending. The Wall Street Wamboozle, the Financial Fartstorm. For instance he launched diplomatic outreach to the Muslim world, but a lot of this was more rhetoric than action, as in his verbal support for the revolution that overthrew Hosni Mubarak in Egypt. He also followed through on his promise to end the war in Iraq, although to be fair the Bush administration had really set him up for success there. And he increased the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan as part of a longer term plan to ending the war there, which has sort of worked? He also authorized a successful military operation that killed Osama bin Laden. depends on who you ask. Among 9 large studies, 6 found that the stimulus did have a positive effect on growth and employment, 3 found that it had little or no effect, and economists are equally divided. The stimulus is estimated to have saved about 3 million jobs, but it also increased the deficit quite a bit. Liberal economists see America’s current 7% unemployment rate as evidence that the Keynesian policies should have gone further, while conservatives say that the Stimulus exploded the federal deficit and debt. The Tea Party is concerned that deficits are out of control and that rising government spending is going to ruin America. The 111th congress was one of the least productive in American history. Unwillingness to compromise precipitated a series of mini-fiscal crises over things like the budget and raising the debt ceiling. Meanwhile, the economy has slowly added jobs and looks halfway decent at the moment mostly because Europe looks so bad. The particular brands of ideological certainty that we see today may seem new but if you look at American history you realize that this has been going on for a long time. job to protect you not only by having a standing army but also making you wear your seat belt? Those are ultimately ideological questions, but we have to grapple with them in a real practical way. And the great story of American governance is compromise. But that is also often been the tragedy ofAmerican governance as when the Constitutional Convention compromised over whether African American people were people. So if you’ve learned anything this year, I hope its been that the American story that we find ourselves in now isn’t entirely novel. And I think we have much to learn from those who came before us.

Robotics is a really cool and important direction for the future. I really believe that in the future we will have AI assistance whether they are embodied or not to act as our guardian angels. These agents will help us with cognitive and physical work. With AI we will see such a wide breadth of applications for instance these technologies have the potential to reduce and eliminate car accidents. We have three types of learning and you have seen different aspects of these methodologies throughout the course we have supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. This work um computers needed about 10 minutes to analyze an image can you imagine okay so how do you go from that to enabling an autonomous vehicle to drive at 90 kilometers an hour well um what they did was they they developed some very fast solutions for paring down the image to only the the the aspects that they needed to look at. They assumed that there were no obstacles in the world which made the problem much easier because all the car had to do was to stay on on the road. This has been a game changer for autonomous cars and we're getting back to the connection between hardware and software. Alexander: We have very effective and Deployable solutions for robot cars that move safely in Easy environments where there aren't many static nor moving obstacles. Many companies and research teams are deploying and developing self-driving cars. Many of these preconditions revolve around certainty in perception planning learning reasoning and execution before we can get to Robo taxi but we can have many other robot solutions that are much that that can happen today. Alexander: We can use deep learning and reinforcement learning to take us from images ofroads onto steering and throttle and what you can do with this is really great. your dimensions and can create a bespoke shoe just for you. All the all the clothing all the items in our environment can kind of awaken our clothing could become robots. The temperature could get adjusted automatically by monitoring people's comfort and gesture. Just-in-time Holograms could be used to make the virtual world much more much more realistic much more connected and so here they're discussing the the design of a new flying car and let's say we have these flying cars and then we can integrate these cars with the it infrastructure.

HONG LIU: This is a key relation between the bulk and the boundary theories. The more you go to the interior of the space time, then corresponding to the lower energy process when viewed form the field theory. So the duality is that once you realize there's such relation, since the two sides are completely different objects, so the game is that you really have to do lots of guess work. Essentially, you have two sides if you want to relate things on two sides. HONG LIU: We have N equals 4 super Yang-Mills theory. And then here, you have type IIB string in Ads5 times ds5. Here on this side, there is a conformal symmetry which we explained before because this is a four dimensional theory. But being the right hand side, we still have some SO 5, S5. So this is more like a space time symmetry. And the isometry of S5 precisely gives you SO6. And we will not be explicit. You can also map the supersymmetry between them. For each global symmetry in the field theory side, there's a corresponding local symmetry on the gravity side. The isometry is important for the following reason. Even though this is a subgroup, when we talk about quantum gravity, the AdS5 times S5 specifies the asymptotic geometry of the space time. So-called large transformations is that they don't go to the Identity at infinity. These large gauge transformations can be considered as the global part of the diffeomorphism. The gauge symmetry is just redundant freedom. You never see it on the other side. essentially the semi classical gravity limit because we still treat the matter fields essentially as quantum. HONG LIU: Yang-Mills theory lives on Minkowski space. And then you say you can imagine that this is the boundary, this relation is related to the bulk and the boundary. And this is a postulate based on that fact. Yes? AUDIENCE: I thought one of the motivations for thinking about the holographic duality was to try to escape [INAUDIBLE] And all of a sudden, it strikes me, so we're trying to get on the boundary of AdS. Then they will also exist in the massless particles. and the field theory. And that also tells you that if you have a theory which due into a higher dimensional theory, and then that theory has a stress tensor, then this bulk theory must have gravity. So you can say, if any field theory is due to a theory of one higher dimension, that theory must involve gravity-- nothing about quantum gravity. Let's stop here. We're not going to get into quantum gravity right now, we're just going to talk about the theory of gravity.

Summary:
Bolek Wyslouch: How do you convert a given physical system with all the forces, et cetera, into some sort of fixed form, fixed type of notation? Bolek: We will work on two, again, simple physical systems, one that consists of two pendula driven by forces of gravity, each of them. And we will discuss various interesting-- even though the system is very simple, just two masses, a spring, a little bit of gravity on top of that. Complex notation is a mathematical answer, how to solve a mathematical equation. But the physics answer is to find fixed frequency modes us such that the system, the complete system, oscillates at one frequency. This is so-called normal mode. So I propose that-- so of course, we use the usual trick that anytime we have a solution in complex variables, we can always get back to real things by taking a real part. But what form of oscillation? OK, all kinds of complex numbers can write, but any particular-- There are two possible solutions to the equation g over l plus k over m minus omega squared. One solution, one oscillation, that does not depend on the spring constant. The other option is usually symmetrically. I move them away from each other. And this is the motion where the spring really comes in at full force. It's being stretched maximally. So very quickly, the spring is stretched. And the whole system oscillates at the same frequency. Because of this additional force of spring, the frequency is actually higher, it's larger. The magenta is normal mode number 2. And blue and the red are the actual pendula. And the motion of blue and red is simply a linear sum of the two. And this is exactly what-- this is the computer simulation that shows you that one of them is going up, the other one down, et cetera. This is for the certain combination of initial conditions. I could go change initial conditions in my program and have a different behavior. But whatever happens, I would be able to-- it will always be a combination of thetwo motions. BolesLAW WYSLOUCH: You can have all kinds of motions by simply adjusting initial conditions. So do you know-- so this is how we can have different shape of motion, depending on the initial condition. So let's say, in fact, do I have it in this one here? Yes. So now, let's take it to, for example, Jupiter. Jupiter, g, is much larger. So the frequency would be larger. Things will be faster, right? That's the higher frequency. But also the difference between two frequencies will be smaller. like this. OK? So there are in fact two-- when you look at this picture, you can see two frequencies. One which is clear the oscillation of the-- high-frequency oscillation. But there's also this kind of overarching frequency of much smaller frequency, and this is what corresponds to a difference of two things. So we see this here. We see it on the pendula. But now what we are going to do is we're going to try to hear it, right? So this is a demonstration which maybe it works, maybe not. sort of early on, to instead of, so far, when we talked about pendula, we describe their motion in terms of motion of number 1. It turns out we can rewrite the equation into some sort of new variables, where, so-called normal coordinates, where you'll simultaneously describe both of them and then kind of mix them together to have a new formula. So you do change of variables. So instead of keeping track of x1 and x2 independently, you define something which I called u1, which is simply x1 plus x2, and I define u2,which is x1 minus x2.

James Swan: I hope everybody saw the correction to a typo in homework 1 that was posted on Stellar last night and sent out to you. We have four course staff that review all the problems. We try to look through it for any issues or ambiguities. Today, we'll look at another one, the eigenvalue decomposition. And on Monday, we will look at a different decomposition called the singular value decomposition, which is a different type of transformation than the one we looked at today. Reordering is essential for solving certain problems via Gaussian elimination. How do you do reordering? Well, we use a process called permutation. Permutation matrices are one class, maybe the simplest class, of unitary matrices. They're transposed. If I swap the rows and then I swap them back, I get back what I had before. And so if I have some reordering of the equations or rows of my system of equations, that's going to be indicated by a permutation matrix, P1. James W. Swan: We discussed sparse matrices and a little bit about reordering and now permutation. He says permutation is a form of preconditioning a system of equations. He shows a simulation that tells us how probable it is to find the Plinko chip in a particular column. Swan: We could construct an alternative model that didn't have that part of the picture that we wanted to have. He's happy to answer questions on.at and he'll be back in a few minutes. Eigenvectors are special vectors that are stretched on multiplication by the matrix. They're only transformed into a stretched form of whatever they were before. For a real N-by-N matrix, there will be eigenvector and eigenvalues, which are the amount of stretch. Eigenvalues are non-linear because they depend on both the value and the vector, the product of the two, for N plus 1 unknowns. We don't know how to solve non- linear equations yet. triangular form for this matrix. We'll talk next time about the singular value decomposition, which is another sort of transformation one can do when we don't have these complete sets of eigenvectors. You'll get a chance to practice these things on your next two homework assignments, actually. So it'll come up in a couple of different circumstances. I would really encourage you to try to solve some of these example problems that were in here. Solving by hand can be useful.

Summary:
A random variable is a number that's produced by a random process. In physics, the number of alpha particles detected by a Geiger counter in a second is believed to be a random number. The number of faulty pixels in a monitor is also produced from an unpredictable randomness in the manufacturing process. The only time that C is not greater than or equal to 1 is when you have all tails, so there's a 7/8 chance, 7 out of 8 outcomes involve 1 or more heads. A random variable is not a variable, it's a function that maps the sample space to the real numbers. Usually this would be a real valued random variable. We have another concept of independence that holds for random variables that was motivated by the definition of independence for events. If I have an event A, I can package A into a random variable, just like the match random variable was really packaging the event that the coins matched into a [? 0-1 ?] valued variable. And it means everything that matters about event A is captured by the random variable IA.

Summary:
Grenade algorithm uses a minimal set of three-point correspondences to solve the camera pose estimation problem in the grenade formulation. The disadvantage of this particular formulation is that it ends up with a four degree polynomial which means that it could give up to a total of four possible solutions. The question becomes whether can we find the solution directly from any four point correspondences such that the solution is unique? The answer is yes and it was formulated by quan at all in a paper that was published in the 1990s. any of the unknowns in the the depth where we simply write it as s i square over here so this can be derived in in this way so here i wrote out all the six combinations of the polynomial equations f i j over here. Each one of this equation it's a just a function of two unknowns  in the four uh unknown depths s1 s2 s3 and s4 and any three of them it's going to give rise to a fourth order polyn coefficients equation. The epmp algorithm mitigates the problem of the linear endpoint algorithm that was shown earlier on by quan and lun that was published in the year 1999 which has cubic complexity in the order of the number of points. The objective is actually to find out the relative transformation between the camera frame and the world frame. We'll first look at the case where these four control points are non-coplanar control points this means that these four Control points will not lie on a plane. We will then use the same relation for the 3d points in the camera coordinates. for the camera pose using a set of control points using four control points in particular and we saw that this uh it's uh the complexity is a linear in terms of the number of points which is much easier to compute then we also saw the degeneracy cases for the camera post estimation problem in particular. If all the points plus the camera center forms a plane then this is also a degenerate case and that's the end of today's lecture thank you mx equals to zero. Mx equals zero.

And so the expectation is 1 over lambda, and so the variance is part c, so OK, so far so good.

Summary:
Professor: Can you explain the physical significance of the crystal momentum? Professor: The information about the momentum can be encoded in these spatial variation of the phase of the wave function. Professor: A central property from the Schrodinger equation is at the time variation d dt of p is equal to the expectation value of minus d the potential of x d x. The momentum expectation value is time independent, so it can be written in the form of e cubed, equal to e to the minus i upon h bar p l. Glossing over in the entire story here. Which of the following. So, is u of x a real function? Well, so when we started out asking what are the eigenfunctions of the transit by l operator, all we showed was that, and I'm going to do this on a separate board just to make it clearer. Tell me if this turns off, because it kept bumping. OK. So we've determined is that if we take q l is equal to alpha, then Phi sub q if eigenvalue label by its eigen value, q, can be written in the form e to the i q x u sub q of x. This diagram is telling you is which e's are allowed. If you put on a capacitor, played across your perfect lattice, you don't get any current. So the particle, the charged particle in your lattice just oscillates back and forth in a block oscillation. And that is manifestly what happens with copper. But the experimentalist comes back to you and says look dude. That is a ridiculous model because the copper isn't in fact perfect, it's messy. So how do you test the model? Well there are two ways to test the situation. One is you improve the model to incorporate properties that copper actually has. And see if you can actually get the same conductivity. Physicists can build a system that has exactly a periodic potential. They can do it with lattices not of atoms, but lattices of dielectric. This has been proved in a very small number of real honest quantum mechanical systems. The question is really a question of quantum computation, which we'll come to next week. But, the basic question is how robust is this answer at all? And the answer is robust at all, because it has enough impurity that it conducts everything in the real world. situation, it depends on the system. And exactly how it depends is something that is an active area of research. So don't throw away the model. Observe that you've modeled the wrong system. If you find a system that fits your-- that is-- that shares the assumptions of your model, that's when you ask did it work. And it worked like a champ. OK. Now let's talk about real materials. This is going to close up our discussion bands and solids. And this is actually what I wanted to get to at the beginning of the lecture. single electron, and let's put it in the system. What will happen? Well if we put it into the system, what state will this single electron fall into? Yeah one event. But which state? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: Yeah, if you kick the system around, you let it relax a little bit. It's going to fall down to the ground state. You have to couple to something else like hydrogen has to be coupled with an electromagnetic field to decay. we add in a lattice we get bands again. The structure's a little more intricate because it depends on the momentum. But these bands now can overlap. Everybody see that? Because there's nothing preventing states from different-- in different multiplates from having the same energy in three dimensions. So how much energy does it take to excite an electron and cause a current that opposes the induced electric field? Nothing. Any electric field that you send in will be opposed by an induced current. called a band insulator. Because there are other ways of being an insulators. So what determined the exact band structure in for a 1D periodic potential? Two properties. One was l, the periodicity. And that came in the q l and k l. And the second is the detailed shape of the potential. Now in three dimensions, the things that are going to determine the potential are not just the distance between atoms, but you have a three dimensional lattice. And so when you solve the problem for the energy eigenvalues is a function of now the three different components of the crystal momentum, you'll get a different set of equations. the atomic orbital structure of the individual atom, the crystal structure, and the resulting band structure. You will almost always find overlapping bands in three dimensions in sufficiently high energy. What we need is one of two things. We need either the band gap coincidentally is ridiculously small, or we need a free particle that has no band gaps at all. That's a good example of that? A free particle, these band gaps go to 0. And so that's a conductor. Just an electron. It conducts, right? OK. If you have a hot piece of copper, then the lattice is wiggling around. And every once in a while, an ion can hit one of the electrons and excite it, give it some momentum. The sea of electrons is constantly being buffeted by this thermal fluctuation. And as a result, you constantly have electrons being excited up, cruising around, falling back down. So you end up with some population of electrons. And they can ask-- and both when asked, although not quite in this language, how likely are you to get an electron up here? How likely is an electron to be excited up thermally? small number. And e to the minus of a small number is close to 1. So at high temperature, you're very likely to excite electrons up here. At low temperatures, it's basically an insulator. This is called a semiconductor. And there are notes on the Stellar. web page that discuss in a little more detail what I just went through and. show you how you build a transistor out of a semiconductors. And the important bit of physics is just this. and metallic without actually being shiny and metallic. And it's not a pigment, so it doesn't absorb light and decay over time. It's like the best thing you could ever do if you wanted to be a shiny, fluttery, flying thing. So there's an incredible amount of physics in this story of the band gaps. And consider this an introduction to the topic. OK. So that's it for band gaps, and I want to move on to the remainder, the last topic of our course. Which is entanglement and quantum computation. Einstein created a thought experiment which we're going to study in detail next week called the EPR experiment. He sent one particle off to a distant planet and the second particle to my sister in DC. And my sister measures this second particle and determines what state it's in and is immediately determined what state the first particle is in over in this distant planet Zorg, right? So that's deeply disconcerting. How can something here dramatically change the state, the configuration, the initial configuration, of a particle arbitrarily far away? Isn't that deeply concerning? who have taken courses in [INAUDIBLE]-- and I'm sure that's all of you because of the GIRs. So I'm very used to microphones, but not in this context. OK. Is this-- yeah, it's on. Can you hear me? All right. So there are lots of ways to slice the story of Einstein by the time he reaches the EPR experiment, which is Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen for the three people who actually wrote the paper. Allan Bloom: Bell had a lovely way to describe this problem of entanglement. Bloom: He had a friend named Bartelstein who had two quirks. He used to say, if you could only see one leg and that sock was pink, you knew to a certainty that the other sock was not pink.Bloom: Same thing. If you have a coin and you cut it in half down the-- so you've got two coin shape disks. You know somebody is cheating by tossing in the half coin that only has a tail on it. Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen argued that the EPR paradox suggested that quantum mechanics was incomplete. They said that if you can perform a measurement, you know that quantity absolutely. But you can't do the-- so on the one hand, quantum mechanics says you can’t know physical reality to this level of precision. And on the other hand, the fact that you can do that measurement violates the relativistic picture of reality. But the question is whether or not the framework of quantum mechanics is somehow unsatisfactory in any formal sense.

The secret to chopping fresh herbs is to chop them not bruised them. The tip is to put a banana in a paper bag then add your unripe fruit put it in a dark place and the banana will speed up the ripening process of the other fruit. Cut a mango the easy way homey you stalk end up cooking either side of the stone cut all the way into the flesh making squares without cutting through the skin then turn it inside out and carefully cut your pieces off. A great tip to prevent burning sensitive skin when working with chilies to get rid of that spice and that heat on your fingers. lemon squeeze a little bit of lemon juice and that instantly gets rid of the heat fresh lemon juice for perfect ball potatoes always start them off with cold water and never boarding water this way by the time the center's are the potatoes are cooked the outside won't be falling apart my tip to get the flesh out of a Kiwi this is simply cut the fruit in half and scoop out with a teaspoon try it it really works.

hey everyone it's sth register nurse rn.com and in this video we're going to be going over our weekly inlex practice question. Let's see what our question says a patient who has a health history of uncontrolled hypertension coronary artery disease and diabetes militis is prescribed to take propanolol. The question asks which statement by the patient is correct about this medication propano wal that they're Going to be taking. The answer is that the patient should take the medication every morning with grapefruit juice and monitor their blood glucose level closely. look and see why D is wrong this patient says that they're going to stop their beta blocker immediately if they experience cold hands and feet well this is a normal side effect with these non-selective beta blockers. You would never just immediately stop taking a beta blocker they need to be tapered off of this because if they just all of a sudden quit taking that medication they can go have cardiac death or something worse can happen so that answer is wrong for that reason okay so that wraps up this inlex practice question.

This is part 2 of a guide to clinical reasoning or how to create an accurate differential diagnosis from a patient's presentation. In the first part I reviewed a practical five-step bedside approach to Clinical reasoning. In this part I will demonstrate how to use this approach with an actual patient case at the student level. I present this patient to you the same way in turn might present the patient to his or her attending on rounds or to their colleagues during a morning report or teaching conference as I present the case I'll keep a running list of the key features of the presentation so they will seem like I am doing step 1 acquired data. There are no causes of four hours of epigastric pain in which we would expect the troponin or CK to be abnormal even in the event that the patient had an acute MI. The combination of acute abdominal pain nausea and a possible contamination of well water is all consistent with heavy-metal poisoning. The most likely diagnosis for this patient is acute pancreatitis if we bring back the key features for this back we see that this is associated with her heavy use of alcohol. The best explanation for the elevated lipase is leukocytosis and leukaemia.

Summary:
Danqi Chen is one of the foremost researchers in question answering. She is the professor at the Princeton University. Danqi once upon a time was the head TA of CS224N. She's quite familiar with the context of this class. So today I'm very happy to introduce to you some of the fundamentals in this field, as well as on cutting edge and state of the art topics. So here's my plan for this lecture. I would give a brief introduction of what question answering is. And then today, delighted to have our first invited speaker. The goal of question answering is to build systems that can automatically answer questions posed by humans in our natural language. Question answering, or, let's say QA in short, is one of the earliest NLP tasks, and the early systems can even date back to the 1960s. IBM Watson has been shown to beat two national champions in Jeopardy answering questions at least at least once in the past. The question and answer has enabled a lot of really useful real world applications, for example, today if you just put your question in a search engine. Stanford Question Answering Dataset is a supervised reading comprehension dataset. It consists of 100K annotated passage question and answer triples. The questions are crowd-sourced, basically like from Mechanical Turking. Each answer is a short segment of text, or we called it span in the passage. The state-of-the-art already exceeds estimated human performance on the SQuAD dataset, according to the Stanford researchers. The evaluation metrics to evaluate how well the system can do on this dataset are exact match and F1. BERT is basically a deep bidirectional transformer encoder pre-trained on large amounts of text. It is trained on the two training objectives, including masked language modeling and the next sentence prediction. The BERTbase has 110 million parameters and the BERT-large model has 330 million parameters. And if you use a stronger pre-training models, like a stronger BERT models, they can even lead to better performance on SQuAD and BiDAF. And you can see that this is a huge jump from the standard BERT model to the BiF model. pre-training has been so important. So next I will quickly talk about-- OK, a question here is that can we actually even design better pre-training objectives for reading comprehension or question answering? And the answer is actually yes. So this is actually a work I did with Mandar Joshi and other folks one year ago called SpanBERT. So for SQuAD and other a lot of extractable reading comprehension datasets, the goal is trying to predict the answer span from the passage of the question. a large collection of documents. So one example is just taking the whole Wikipedia, which has five million articles. And we're going to return the answer for any open-domain questions. So this problem, there isn't any single passage, so we have to answer questions against a very largeCollection of documents or even the whole web documents. This is actually a much more challenging and also more practical problem. So if you look at the example of Google example I showed at the beginning, so these techniques will be very useful in the practical applications. unsupervised question answering so by using some kind of approach like some form of unsupervised machine translation, this kind of idea. That can be borrowed-- can borrow the idea from that and can also work pretty well, reasonably well in unsuper supervised question answering. So my question is I guess it's kind of interesting that there's not really that strong of a transfer effect between data sets that are kind of ostensibly similar. So have there been any research done on how close I guess the formatting and the semantic content of these question answering datasets actually adheres to the data that BERT is pre trained on? And if so, has there been sort of any effect found between those similarities or differences? Is the question asking whether there has been like somekind of-- OK, maybe I can just try to clarify a little bit why the current models cannot really generalize well from one data set to another data set. the answer? So why do you think the nearest neighbor-- I mean, you always can find something, right? The question is that whether it's close enough or not. So the question is what if in the datasets that the answer is not close enough? Yeah, that's a good question. If you really come up with something that is really very far away from all the questions that we have been seeing in the training set, that could be possible. Basically it depend on how the text are formatted. Next question is about the future of NLP. Do you think that in order to solve NLP in the sense that you can perform on par with humans on all NLP tasks it's sufficient to only interact with text data? Or do you think we'll eventually need the sort of experiences and common sense that we get only from seeing and viewing the world and having a set of interactions that we as humans have? The answer is definitely yes. Next is-- Hey, how is it going? Thanks so much for the lecture. The key difference between the generative model and the extractive model is that for generative models, you can actually leverage more input passage together and do the generation. So for this model, there isn't any retrieval. So you can always find the answer from the question, right? So this model really has you relying on all the parameters you memorized, all the encodings. And then Generative models are you're remembering the whole question and you try to retrieve the memory when you answer the question. The model is very large, like 11 billion parameters. So the parameters are basically trying to memorize a lot of information that has been.information. So by just taking this input, it has to just rely on the parameters to infer this answer. So it's actually very hard to-- yeah, it's a definite balance between memory and the generalization from it. All right, thanks. Do you want to call it a night or do you want one more question? Either way, yeah.

Summary:
 homework two is out now. This weekend sessions will be having some more background on deep learning. We're also gonna be reaching, uh, releasing by the end of tomorrow, what the default projects will be for this class. Um, and those proposals will be due, um, very soon, er, in a little over a week. The assignments, [inaudible] are they limited to TensorFlow? asked the question if, if the assignment is limited toTensorFlow. I'm pretty sure that everything relies that you're using Tensor Flow. Last week, we were discussing value function approximation. Today we're gonna start to talk about other forms of value function approximations using deep neural networks. We're mostly not gonna talk so much about enormous action spaces, but we are gonna think a lot about really large state spaces. And so, this could be things like a laser range finder for our robot, which told us how far away the walls were in all 180 degree directions. And the key thing was that we don't know what the true value of a policy is. So, the two ways we talked about last time was inspired by the same. The number of data points you need tends to scale with the dimension. So, one alternative that we didn't talk so much about last time is to use sort of a really, really rich function approximator class. Um, in general we're going to have almost no theoretical guarantees the rest of the time, but in practice they often work really well. And so, what we're gonna talk about today is thinking about deep neural networks which also have very flexible representations but we hope they're gonna scale a lot better. Deep neural networks are artificial connections with artificial neural networks inside our brain. They are used in unsupervised learning like predicting whether or not something is a cat or not or, you know, an image, uh, of a particular object, um, or for regression. They combine both linear and non-linear transformations, and they need to be differentiable if gradient descent is to be used to fit them. In the last 5 to 8 years, there's auto differentiation. So, you don't have to derive all of these gradients by hand instead. In 1994, we had TD backgammon which used Deep Neural Networks. And then we had the results that were kind of happening around like 1995 to maybe like 1998, which said that, "Function approximation plus offline off policy control, plus bootstrapping can be bad, can fail to converge" So I think it sort of really changed the story of how people are perceiving using, um, this sort of complicated function approximation, meters, and RL. And so, perhaps it was natural that, like, around in like 2014, DeepMind and DeepMind combined them and had some really amazing successes with Atari. DQN, deep Q-learning addresses these is by experienced replay and fixed Q-targets. Experienced replay, prime number if you guys have heard about this, if you learned about DQN before is we're just gonna stroll data. So, even though we're treating the target as a scalar, the weights will get updated the next round which means our target value changes. So this is nice because basically it means that you reuse your data instead of just using each data point once, you can reuse it and that can be helpful. Of what the agent is doing. So, remember the agent's just learning from pixels here how to do this. Um, and the beginning of its learning sort of this policy. You can see it's not making- doing the right thing very much, um, and that over time as it gets more episodes it starting to learn to make better decisions. So this is really cool that sort of it could discover things that maybe are strategies that people take a little while to learn when they're first learning the game as well. Replay is hugely important and it just gives us a much better way to use the data. Double DQN is kind of like double Q learning, which we covered very briefly at the end of a couple of classes ago. Greedy Policy is where we average networks, average reward networks, and then use one of the Qs as the target for the other network. Then we update Q2 with 50 percent probability, we pick the next action from the next network, this is a pretty small change. CNN's John Defterios asks students to vote on whether they think it matters which of four possible replay backups to do. If you pick any of the four, you're going to get the same value function no matter what you do. It matters the order in which you do it, so ordering can make a big difference, he says. Defterio: I think to say like what should we be putting in our replay buffer, not only do we wanna think about what- what should be in a replay buffer but also what order do we sampled them? It could be super tempting to try to start, by like implementing Q learning directly on the ATARI. Highly encourage you to first go through, sort of the order of the assignment and like, do the linear case, make sure your Q learning is totally working. Even with the smaller games, like Pong which we're working on, um, it is enormously time consuming. It's way better to make sure that you know your Q Learning method is working, before you wait, 12 hours to see whether or not, oh it didn't learn anything on Pogge.

In this section, we're going to talk about the relativistic Doppler effect. We make good use of our space-time diagrams, which we discussed earlier. The question is how is this being observed by an observer which is moving with a relative velocity v with respect to the source? So the question is not how this observed-- how this is seen by the source but how it is being viewed by the observer. We have to apply Lorentz transformation to the data. that the period now is given by 1 plus beta over 1 minus beta square root of that times tau. And the frequency is the inverse. So we just calculated relativistically how the period and the frequency of a wave is Lorentz transformed. We'll have 1 minus Beta over 1 plus Beta squareroot of that [? times ?] the frequency. That's how we get the period of the wave and the rate of its movement. The period is the same as the frequency, but the rate is the opposite.

Political philosophy is the oldest of the social sciences. It can boast a wealth of heavy hitters from Plato and Aristotle to Machiavelli, Hobbes, Hegel, Tocqueville, Nietzsche. The study of the great books or great thinkers of the past can easily degenerate into a kind of antiquarianism, into a sort of pedantry, says Professor Steven Smith. But these works provide us with the most basic questions that continue to guide our field, he says. "The ideas of John Maynard Keynes, both economists and political philosophers, when they are right, are more powerful than is commonly understood," says Smith. unnecessary or redundant. It would wither away. Political philosophy exists and only exists in that... call it "zone of indeterminacy" between the "is" and the "ought," between the actual and the ideal. This is why political philosophy is always and necessarily a potentially disturbing undertaking. Those who embark on the quest for knowledge of the best regime may not return the same people that they were before. But there is some compensation for this, I think. The study of political philosophy may be the highest tribute we pay to love.

Ahern: I have never had an exam where I had fewer questions. There were maybe 10 questions I got on the exam and that was for a class of this side, really unusual. I find most students are honest. I've only had a handful of situations where in this class, where I've had dishonesty as an issue. The only students I've ever had with serious dishonesty issues actually were in smaller classes interestingly enough. But it has happened here and I do have taped evidence when it does happen. Ahern: How many zwitterions, how many amino acids can form zwittersion? None. They all can. That's not trick. You guys should know that, right? Is the answer "None" a trick? I'm sorry, I don't think so, folks. There are no amino acids, everything, so think about it. Ahern: What did you have in mind for the last question? The one about the Kcat. How can you have two apparent Kcats? It depends on how you calculate the concentration of the enzyme. where time is sometimes a factor, and so I was going to have 3 of the longer answer questions and I decided not to do that and I made them shorter. Next term, the format of the exam changes in 451. Most people like 451 better because the maximum number of points on a question I think is 3. If you're going to spend a fair amount of time on something, it should be worth more points. Anybody hate the exam? You can say it. As I said, I don't...okay, there you go. Ahern: I hope everybody got how I start my lecture. The first thing I say is "Okay folks, let's get started." I don't live consciously, I just blurt it out. Ahern: Last time I talked about, in some detail, mechanisms by which this, these S1 proteases worked. And I hope you've had a chance to look through those mechanisms and sort of lay things out. It's very easy to alter the genetic code for any of these proteases and change which amino acid is presence at any given place. "I hate telling joke about sex or the other, but... Carbonic anhydrase" is a pretty amazing enzyme. It can catalyze the conversion of a million molecules of substrate into product per second, per enzyme. Most of our body tissues are at a pH of 7 to 7.4. We look at Blood, for example, is about 7.3 to 7,4. "I want every woman to love me" and poof, he turns into a box of chocolates. Ahern: The rate of formation of the nucleophile is the critical step in the catalytic action of this enzyme. At pH 9, the enzyme is still holding its shape enough that it's actually able to continue catalysis. When we get above that, we're going to see the ending drop off precipitously. Ahern: There is a lot of interest in manipulating enzymes to increase their activity and increase their efficiency. In the case of carbonic anhydrase, what's actually limiting them is actually defusing them.

RAFAEL JARAMILLO: Let's talk about intermediate phases and line compounds. He recalls intermediate phase in a three-phase system. He draws a free-energy composition diagram in such a case. Jaramillo: All possible common tangents are going to converge at the same point. He says this type of structure is a Laves compound, which is also known as Laves Laves, or Laves' compound. It's a broad structure, he says, and it can be used to develop new materials. 1/7 of the Gibbs free energy of the IV-III phase. And these phase factions are determined by lever law. This is really the point. When you have line compounds in coexistence in equilibrium, there are no internal composition variables. And that's what's led to everything we've been enjoying over the last month and a half, is the fact that solution phases are variable. And now we have these cases where the compositions are not there [INAUDIBLE] anymore. OK. I want to leave you with one final thought, which is leading into Wednesday's lecture,. which is the case of metal oxides. z is an integer or a rational fraction, and it's fixed-- SiO2, magnesium oxide, Al2O3, so forth. So when we return on Wednesday, we're going to talk about the thermodynamics of this reaction. We'll use this property of being line compounds, and we're also going to use a bunch of other things as well. Back to the page you came from. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion and @cnnopin.

A random variable can take different numerical values depending on the outcome of the experiment. Some of the possible numerical values of a random variable will be more likely than others. We will describe these relative likelihoods in terms of the so-called probability mass function, or PMF. The PMF is also sometimes called the probability law or the probability distribution of a discrete random variable. We use a subscript, X, to indicate which random variable we're talking about. And it has a probability. And in our case this probability is equal to 1/2.

Summary:
Protein three-dimensional structure and its implications for the binding of small molecules such as drugs. How can we use these basic motifs to recognize other macromolecules, other proteins and nucleic acids? We have these motifs that we could find, weight matrices for them by aligning lots of sequences. Now instead of aligning sequences, let's see what we can do by mutating both the protein part and the nucleic acid part. And then we know from the three dimensional structure that it interacts mainly with the middle nucleotides. groove of the DNA. And the reason the textbook is wrong, first of all, it emphasizes the non-helical part of the zinc finger. And also the way it loops through the DNA, if you look at this carefully in your textbook, it actually interdigitates with a phosphodiester bond. So we now have a semi-empirical way of computing-- in a certain sense, predicting new regulatory protein DNA interactions with double-stranded DNA. Can we extend this to RNA? This is a much more complicated situation with RNA because you don't have these long perfect double helices anymore. You have these very short RNA helices. Programming is just the beginning of interacting with input and output from various devices. The topic today is proteins, and this really is the main contact between the exquisite regulatory mechanisms. Here, we need sensors to sense the environment. We need actuators to then deliver back into the environment what the cell wants to do or to interact with other cells. You have to have feedback, synchrony, so on, and that's the topic of some of our network analysis in the last three lectures. that you can basically program the almost digital nucleic acid world inside the cell but via clearly analog inputs and outputs. We also-- I've listed some of the scariest proteins that I could think of. And we're going to talk about three of them. One of them in the slide is the proteins that are actually involved in causing the symptoms that come from when you're worried about anthrax. And then we'll talk about HIV yet again, this time, polymerase mutants that cause drug resistance. The turnover of an enzyme is the time it takes to for a small molecule, say, to find and bind the enzyme, to possibly go through a catalytic step, and to dissociate as a product. The accuracy depends on the method. As you get to 1 Angstrom or better in your accuracy, as you can get from NMR and X-ray crystallography, you now are in a position to study catalytic mechanism and design and improve ligands, such as drugs. The way we program in general proteins is either transgenics, where we might overproduce the protein, or homologous recombination. Point mutants are not the only way to generate conditional mutants. But there are ways that you can program, and conditional, meaning thatyou can regulate under what conditions the protein is expressed or not. Another way is by modulating the activity of the proteins from the outside with drugs or drug-like molecules and chemical kinetics. And under the subheadings for that, you can make these by combinatorial synthesis. In the case of the zinc finger, we made an altered specificity. We made new zinc fingers with bind to completely new trinucleotides. With the DNA polymerase, by changing one amino acid, we could make it now accept almost four logs better an inhibitor is very useful. These are not that unusual. And those can be designed or naturally occurring. They can have a very important thing to do with conserved charge. They tend to be highly conserved. That's a general way of looking at the conservation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms. That might have impact on pharmacogenomics. The idea of chemical diversity, in a way I hope nicely connects to where we've been with RNA arrays. RNA arrays, and the double-stranded RNA array that we used earlier in class today, can be generated in a commentorial sense. Solid phase comes up again and again in arrays. It's very obvious why you have a solid phase. You want to be able to address it by its positions in x and y on the array. And those are the major concepts. Now, let's go through. This is-- the topic here is proteins.

More than half of large US firms plan to use AI within the next year to automate tasks that were previously done by staff in a bid to cut costs boost profits and make their work more productive. The New York Times reports that generative AI could automate activities equivalent to 300 million full-time jobs around the world. open ai's chief executive that's Sam mman says governments will need to assume the bulk of responsibility in supporting workers AI labor market disruptions and the question will employees just end up training AI systems only to them be replaced by them. were most at risk because of automation. People are realizing you have to throw out the door any ideas you had about who is really at risk and say every job is going to be changed. We just hope that the workers whose jobs are changing have a voice in saying how yeah it's turkeyy is not going to vote for Christmas are they if those are the ones that could find their jobs being replaced but there's so much in there and Stephanie just a final thought from you in all of this about briefly if you will.

Summary:
foreign I'm really excited especially for this lecture which is a very special lecture on robust and trustworthy deep learning by one of our sponsors of this amazing course themus AI. Themis AI is a startup actually locally based here in Cambridge our mission is to design advance and deploy the future of AI and trustworthy AI specifically. I'm especially excited about today's lecture because I co-founded Themis right here at MIT right here in this very building in fact this all stemmed from really the incredible scientific innovation and advances that we created right here. an extremely famous paper a couple years ago showed that if you put terms that imply female or women into a large language model powered job search engine you're going to get roles such as artists or things in the humanities. If you help input similar things but of the male counterpart you'll end up with roles for scientists and engineers so this type of bias also occurs regardless of the task at hand for a specific model. Finally let's talk about Healthcare recommendation algorithms these recommendation algorithms tend to amplify racial biases. Uncertainty estimation is useful for scenarios like this this is an example of a Tesla car driving behind a horse-drawn buggy which are very common in some parts of the United States. The model does not know what this image is. The exact same problem that resulted in that video has also resulted in numerous autonomous car crashes so let's go through why something like this might have happened. There are multiple different types of uncertainty in neural networks which may cause incidents like the ones that we just saw we'll go through a simple example. a data set called cityscapes and the inputs are RGB images of scenes the labels are pixel wise annotations of which label every pixel belongs to and the outputs try to mimic the labels they're also predicted pixel wise masks. Why would we expect that this data set has high natural alliatoric uncertainty and which parts of thisData set do you think would have aliatoric uncertainty. If a model has never seen a specific input before or that input is very hard to learn all of these models should predict slightly different answers and the variance of them should be higher. At Themis we believe that uncertainty and bias mitigation unlock a host of new solutions to solving these problems with safe and responsible AI. We can use bias and uncertainty to mitigate risk in every part of the AI life cycle. We're developing a product at Themis called AI guardian and that's essentially a layer between the artificial intelligence algorithm and the user and the way this works is this is the type of algorithm that if you're driving an autonomous vehicle would say hey the model doesn't actually know what is happening in the world around it right now as the user. compete in the competition which the details are described in the lab but basically it's about analyzing this data set creating risk-aware models that mitigate bias and uncertainty in the specific training pipeline. At Themis our goal is to design advance and deploy a trustworthy AI across Industries and around the world. We're hiring for the upcoming summer and for full-time roles so if you're interested please send an email to careers themesai.io or apply by submitting your resume to the Deep learning resume drop and we'll see those resumes and get back to you.

Summary:
HONG LIU: So if you want to compute, say, some scattering amplitude from alpha to beta-- so alpha's some initial state and beta's some final state. Say alpha consists of momentum p1 and PN-- or pm, and beta, say momentum p m plus 1 and pn. And then you can get this scattering amplitude just by taking your momentum-space correlation function, OK, for the n points. So this is obtained by doing a Fourier transform. So any questions on this? Yes? AUDIENCE: So can you explain again why this diagram, like, you have one branch and then there's a loop? HONG LIU: To derive that theorem, the time-order matters. So we mentioned that if you have a diagram like this, say minus P1, minus P2, to P3, P4, and then the square root and amplitude are just given by minus i lambda, because you need to throw away all the external propagators. OK, you just need to-- you have to truncate all the External propagators, so that means you also throw away diagrams like this. You can consider arbitrary, complicated diagram, OK, as far as that only happens-- yeah. HONG LIU: This is the self-interact-- yeah, just when the-- when you have an interacting theory. When the particle propagates, it actually can interact with the virtual particle. And so that, this kind of interaction, will affect the property of the propagation. It can have the most effect by prefactor, but actually can change the mass, too. But for the-- oh, it can correct for the mass-- and also, that's the subject of the QFT2. The Dirac equation is one of the most beautiful equations in mathematical physics. It's actually describing electrons, so it's not only beautiful, but it's actually useful. The most general way to write it is to try to write the first-order equation which is Lorentz invariant. When you go to a different frame, the equation looks the same. Just different observers in different laboratory, that's what we mean by the equation of the Lorez transformation transform to be Lorez covariant. the meaning of all these different solutions for alpha and beta or for gammas, OK? So as I mentioned, you can have infinite number of solutions. What's the meaning of them? So first, let's imagine when we look at this equation-- so as I said, this is a matrix equation. In this matrix equation, then you have this psi which is a four- component vector. OK, so imagine, just say, consider making a basis change in psi. So now, so psi prime satisfies essentially the same equation but a different gamma matrix. because one is going to change the basis. So you can show any matrices which satisfy that equation, they're all related by similarity transformation. They're just corresponding to a change of basis. Different forms of the gamma, they may be useful for different purposes. OK, so it depends on which regime, sometimes you use different gamma matrices. So now having introduced the Dirac equation and then the structure of theDirac equation, but still we haven't showed that the DirAC equation is covariant. Consider such a Lorentz transformation, OK, so and then phi transforms as following, phi prime x prime phiprime. New phi evaluated at the new position should be the same as phi evaluation at the old position. So the phi-- yeah, just equal to phi lambda minus 1 x. So now if you look at the Klein-Gordon equation, let's see how this is covariant. OK, it's the same in any frame. Now we want to show that the Dirac equation has the same property.

The U.S. Supreme Court is the highest federal court in the United States. The job is for life, barring resignation, retirement, or removal from the court by impeachment. So far, six justices have been foreign-born, at least one never graduated from high school, and another was only 32 years old when he joined the bench. Most presidents nominate individuals who broadly share their ideological view, so a president with a liberal ideology will tend to appoint liberals to the court. Of the 112 justices who have held the position, not one has yet been removed from office.

Summary:
This is actually the second time we are having this class. We had it last year in a smaller version. That was for six units of a credit, and we had it once a week. And so we got some good response last year. So, with the support of the math department, we decided to expand this class to be 12 units of credit. And we have every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon from 2:30 to 4:00, as you know, in this classroom. And the purpose of this course is really to give you a sampling menu to see how mathematics is applied in modern finance. Jake Xia: I'm not going to tell you the story of Pi or "Life of Pi" That's not a financial story. The rest of the story, alpha, beta, delta, gamma, theta, which you will learn from Peter and Choongbum and Vasily's classes. So I'm going to talk about vega. But how many of you actually know what a vega is? OK, lot of people know. But anyway, so that's my first day at Morgan Stanley. Financial products is really just one form of trading. There are many other ways of trading aside from exchanges. The different regions have different exchanges and markets, as well. And the structure of the products it become more tailor-made for either investors or borrowers. So coming back to the market, one large type of player is really the only way to get back into the financial market. Essentially, Glass-Steagall, after 1933, is really what made the financial industry what it is today. It's really about someone has money, someone doesn't. stock, I think a lot of people know pretty much where it is. But if it's not transparent, so what do you do? So that market maker comes in to provide that liquidity, and then takes the risk. They manage the book by balancing those Greeks, which I mentioned earlier. And we talk about the volatility exposure was vega. And on top of that, what are the tail risks? What are the events can actually get you into big trouble? So people use value at risk. I think Peter will-- or Choongbum will-- probably Peter will teach. Vasily Kuznetsov: Arbitrage is really to find the relationships between prices, and try to profit from those relationship mispricing. He says the systematic trader builds computer models. Kuznets: Math is very useful in risk management, which I will give you some quiz -- questions -- to answer. You can see that risk management itself is very challenging, but yet, math plays a very important role, he says, to quantify how much exposure you have to risk. Professor Jake Xia: Trading is really all about how do you risk manage, have the discipline, and how to manage your losses. When you go to the market, you buy a stock. When the stock goes up, makes bit of money, the natural tendency is to let's take profit. But when the stock loses money, what's your natural tendency? Professor Jake XIA: I think natural tendency, lot of people will keep it. But if you think the fundamental story is very sound, you should think about as if you don't have a position. Learn the math, learn the finance first, but keep those questions along the way when you are learning during this class. Go to the course website, read what we have put up for the financial glossary. If you still have things you don't understand, compile your own list of financial concepts, which you can search on the web or even ask us. So, that's really-- and read other materials on the course work. We got maybe-- how about this? We still got about 15 minutes or 12 minutes left, so I'll pass it to Vasily, then maybe we can leave five minutes for some questions. every time. So, if you want to differentiate this functions and get a derivative, then this derivative will be quite noisy. And so, instead of getting the true derivative, you might obtain something quite different from true derivative just because there is a confidence interval around any point. So obviously, there is somewhere balance, and the question was, is there an optimal shift size to get the derivative? And that's what-- uh oh, the slide got corrupted. There was an answer. And we actually are implementing it in our systems and plan to use it in practice. We put syllabus there, a short list of literature. We will be posting a lot of materials there. Probably most lectures will be published there. Jake's slides are there already. So, any questions? We like to get your emails so we can put you on the website for further announcements. But it's probably easier if you put your email on the sign up sheet, so that we can [INAUDIBLE]. VASILY STRELA: Yeah, but please visit and sign up here, because there will be announcements to the class.

Summary:
Climate change is changing us from the inside out in the UK one in four adults and one in 10 children experience mental illness. Half of the people they spoke to experienced negative impacts on their mental health due to the heat. People on Lower incomes and other disadvantaged groups groups were more likely to feel the negative effects of extreme heat because it was harder for them to keep their homes cool. You don't even need to be alive to experience some of these effects a study of expecting mothers who experienced Hurricane Sandy in 2012 the huge storm that hit New York showed that in unborn children who did experience that storm girls as early as preschool were 20 times as likely to experience anxiety. people in that storm showed that about half of these folks had some kind of post-traumatic stress and that's relative to 5% of the general population. Direct effects of climate change on people's mental health there's also knock on effects like loss of income and Rising prices which inevitably have implications for people's well-being. We are not separate from our environment we are connected not just to the world around us but of course to one another and it and it is only in working with one another that we're going to be able to move forward.

Adam Martin: How do you go from something you're interested in learning about an organism to actually identifying genes and mechanisms that are important for that? Martin: The two heroes of today's lecture will be the roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans, and the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. He also highlights a couple important vertebrate-model organisms-- the zebrafish and the mouse. Martin: Most of them are fairly small, and they're easy to house large numbers of them in a lab. the sonic-hedgehog gene is important in cancer. And actually, there are now a number of drugs that are being developed to target the hedgehog pathway. One was approved back in 2012 for use in treating basal-cell carcinoma. And there's currently another drug that's in phase-II clinical trials for treating some forms of leukemia. So this is a story that goes from identifying this weird fly mutant all the way to clinical trials, developing drugs, whose purpose is to inhibit this signaling pathway.

So, wait little later we will talk about that that topic, right now we are just talking about movement and shifts, the direction of movement. We are not talking about the slope. So, what is price control what do we mean by price control? Price control is how we can regulate the prices of the goods in the market.

Summary:
The size of the ribosome is similar to the size of a rhinovirus. The mature transcript is resistant to exonucleases. The poly-adenine tail of the transcript is structural to protect the ends of that transcript. The transfer RNAs and theribosomes are the molecular players in translation. They play a key role in translation and give you much more proteins than one gene can encode, which is a wonderful way to diversify transcripts and give them different functions. The genetic code, which forms the basis of this entire concept, has some features to it where it does have some degeneracy. But we'll go through the degeneracy, and we'll take a look at the genetic code because it will tell us exactly how the three letter-- the words made of three bases encode everything we need for translation. The ribosomes were discovered a decade later, and that was the work that was awarded a Nobel Prize for. And then, later on, things started to get to the point where you know, these are sort of things you want to get out to.

Summary:
Professor Donald Kagan: We are living in the early years of a polis sometime in the eighth century B.C. The date that's typical for the general phenomenon of colonization coming out of the mother cities of Greece is 750 roughly. The earliest date according to Greek tradition, if my memory is correct, was something like 773 where the Greeks date the foundation of what they thought was the earliest colony they ever established -- a place that they called Pithaecusa, which is the island of Ischia. will decide whether it's a good idea for him or not. Now, recruiting is tremendously important because you need to have a certain number of settlers to make the settlement viable. So however many that is, that is what you try to recruit and you recruit typically at a time when it's easy to get people together so you can tell them the story. The best time would be at some great festival. There are festivals held in each city just for its own citizens and my guess is that when you could do that, when you felt that you could recruit a full colony from your fellow citizens in Corinth, let us say, that's what you did. Syracuse is an independent polis, autonomous, self-governing, whatever regime it wants. It is not a subject of anybody, not Corinth or anybody else. The most typical, the usual, everything else is an exception is that there are friendly relations between the mother city and the apoikia. Corinth sent out a lot of colonies, which is why we know something about their arrangements. The first battle of the Peloponnesian War was a battle between Corinth and Corcyra. Kagan: The overwhelming normal situation is the first one I described, friendly relations. colonies to send representatives back to the mother city for the religious observations that were common to them all, so that those create good feelings. Corinth always needs that kind of stuff, so we sell you our wheat, you sell us your pottery, we sell good wine that we can't grow yet and maybe never will be able to grow in our neighborhood, so on and so forth. So you can see why it would be very natural for all sorts of ties to unite these colony and mother city. come to mean weights of silver or gold. So now you have a change in fundamental economic things. Well, all of this is tied up with this colonial story I've been telling you. Finally, I think, it works in both directions at the same time in terms of the impact all of these changes have on the political situation. On the one hand the changes, that is (A) the rise of the hoplite class; (B) the development of lots of commerce and industry and wealth in a new kind. that colonization provided something analogous to that for the Greek people. So now, here we are somewhere in the seventh century, most of these places I've been talking about have been settled, the currents that I have been describing are flowing and the kinds of problems they have give rise to what will be felt in most of the towns. That is the proper introduction to the next topic, which I'll discuss next year. No not--it seems like a year, but it's next Tuesday actually.

Summary:
well welcome back everybody to uh the last lecture 162. this is kind of a a special lecture um i did get some requests for more information about distributed storage and quantum computing and so i think we're going to do that. i want to make sure that we talk through the chord algorithm since that's a i think relatively simple thing to understand and is uh very cool and applied pretty much everywhere so if you remember one of the things we talked about last week was basically this cap theorem which was really a conjecture that eric brewer put forth back in the early 2000s. The cord algorithm has been turned into storage systems of many sorts including those used by amazon et cetera okay facebook. The chord algorithm lets you get by with only knowing essentially a logarithmic number of nodes in the total system and you can still do this well. We're going to associate each one of those storage nodes is going to get a unique id. We'll talk you through that in the next slide and then i'm going to show you how the chord algorithm is used to divide our space up. it adapts automatically which is pretty good okay so what i wanted to do next uh i'm going to talk a little bit about security and then um talk through a couple of things and then i want to uh try to get to quantum computing as well so we can i know there was some of you asked some questions about that so i'mgoing to leave this topic unless there's more questions okay. Security is kind of dealing with actions of a knowledgeable attacker who's really trying to cause harm and we want to make sure that uh they can't really screw us up okay. i'm hoping that if you haven't taken 161 it's on your list because there's a very interesting set of things that people can talk about. cryptography is one of the central points of many of these mechanisms you just have to use it correctly. The idea of a secure hash function is one where you take data and you run it through a hash function and you get a bunch of bits out of it. If you change the data even slightly you end up with a good hash function with something that essentially roughly half the bits change. The vision here really is of pretty much everybody using data capsules everywhere okay and if you can get that to happen then you could potentially have a very interesting scenario here. Part of what we're doing is we're working with roboticists and machine learning folks to put their data and their models for grasping and so on inside of data capsules and as a result they can reside securely in the edge in say your robots or whatever in a way that can't be breached okay. This is really targeted at secure edge infrastructure in addition to the cloud so these data capsules can move back and forth. unforgeable all right good so let me say a little bit about using quantum mechanics to compute. It's basically using weird but kind of useful properties of quantum mechanics two of them quantization and superposition. If you're willing to allow things to not be always a one or always a zero what you can do is you can just start doing quantum computing. There are many other algorithms out there now these days these days they've been slowly working on them but these are some pretty good ones that might be interesting. high probability some answer that was hard to find that's what we would like okay and so if you look here um you know if the two n inputs are equally probable there could be two to the n outputs that are equally likely. What we'd like is the probability of the outputs to be piled up high on the answer we want and it turns out that something like fourier transform does the trick okay. If we can do a fourier transforms on some input we can actually get an interesting output. So that's the essence of the shortest factoring algorithm. actually investigated if you were to build uh that factoring algorithm and you could do it as quantum circuits that could run on a quantum computer what would that look like. We actually investigated ways of optimizing that and we could actually look at performance of different options for the shortest factoring algorithms. So we built a cad tool to do that so i i don't know i think it's a pretty interesting area right now and there's a lot of interest in it all right so um sorry i kept you guys way over but this is the last lecture i figured if anybody was interested we talked about key value stores.

Summary:
so in the next portion of today's lecture we're going to talk about how we can modify the policy gradient uh calculation to reduce its variance. In this way actually obtain a version of thepolicy gradient that can be used as a practical reinforcement learning algorithm. The first trick that we'll start with is going to exploit a property that is always true in our universe which is causality causality says that the policy at time t prime can't affect the reward at another time step t if t is less than t prime. that is it's the rewards from now until the end of time which means that it refers to the rewards that you have yet to collect basically all the rewards except for the ones in the past or the reward to go. The causality trick that i described before you can always use it you'll use it in homework two it reduces your variance. There's another slightly more involved trick that we can use that also turns out to be very important to make policy gradients practical and it's something called a baseline. We will get much more into this in the next lecture when we talk about extra critical algorithms. different policy parameters you'll have one value of the baseline for parameter one a different value for parameter two. In practice we often don't use the optimal variance we just uh sorry we typically just use the expected reward but if you want the optimal baseline this is how you would get it all right so to review what we've covered so far we talked about the high variance of policy gradients algorithms. We talked about how we can lower that variance by exploiting the fact that present actions don't affect past rewards and we can use baselines which are also unbiased.

Summary:
Today we're gonna talk about learning in the setting of games. What does learning mean? How do we learn those evaluation functions that we talked about? And then, er, towards the end of the lecture, we wanna talk a little [NOISE] bit about variations of the game- the games we have talked about. So, uh, how about if you have- how about the cases where we have simultaneous games or non-zero-sum games? And an example of that is rock, paper, scissors. Can you still be optimal if you reveal your strategy? In the game of chase- che- and chess example is, you have this evaluation function that can depend on the number of pieces you have, the mobility of your pieces. Maybe the safety of your king, central control, all these various things that you might care about. So we're gonna talk about how learning is applied to these game settings. And specifically the way we are using learning is to just get a better sense of what this evaluationfunction should be from some data. And, and that kind of introduces to this, um, temporal difference learning. It's very similar to Q-learning. can actually, like, roll two dice and based on the outcome of your dice, you move your pieces various, various amounts to. Uh, there are a bunch of rules. So your goal is to get all your pieces off the board. If you have only one piece and your opponent gets on top of you, they can push you to the bar and you have to start again. The idea is, we want to come up with features that we would care about in this game of backgammon. So a feature template- set of feature templates could look like this. "We generate episodes and then from these episodes, we want to learn. These episodes look like state action reward states and then they keep going until we get a full episode" "The reward is going to be 0 throughout the episode until the very end of- end of the game. Until we end the episode and we might get some reward at that point or we might not" "We go over them to make things better and better. So that's, kind of, the key idea" So, so what do we try to do usually, like when you are trying to do learning? We have prediction, we have a target, what do I do? Minimize the- your error. So, so my target the thing that I'm trying to like get to is the reward plus Gamma V of s prime, w, okay? So we're playing games, in games Gamma is usually 1. And then the update is just this, this particular update where we move in the negative direction of the gradient. This is, this is what you guys have seen already, okay. to 0.25 and 0.75 then it kind of stays there, and you are happy. All right so, so this was just an example of TD learning but this is the update that you have kind of already seen. And then a lot of you have pointed out that this is, this is similar to Q-learning already, right? This is actually pretty similar to update, um, it's very similar, like we have these gradients, and, and the same weight that we have in Q- learning. The idea of learning in games is old. People have been using it. In the case of Backgammon, um, this was around '90s when Tesauro came up with, with an algorithm to solve the game. And he was able to reach human expert play. And then more recently we have been looking at the game of Go. So, in this section we're gonna talk a little bit about AlphaGo Zero too. So if you're attending section I think that will be part of that story.

Summary:
The famous example was posed by Comte de Buffon back in the 18th century. It marks the beginning of a subject that is known as the subject of geometric probability. The problem is pretty simple. We take a needle that has a certain length-- l-- and we throw it at random on the plane. The needle might fall this way, so that it doesn't cross any line, or it might fall that way, and it ends up crossing one of the lines. If the needle is long enough, it might actually end up crossing two of the Lines. is this 4 with this 2 give us a 2. We have 2l over pi d. And then the integral from 0 to pi over 2 of sine theta. Now the integral of sin theta is minus cosine theTA. And we need to evaluate this at 0 andpi over 2. This turns out to be equal to 1. And this is the final answer to the problem that we have been considering. And now, a curious thought. How can you figure out the number pi? Take your needle, throw it at random a million times, and count the frequency with which the needle ends up crossing the line. So it gives you a good estimate of this particular number. unit cube. So you throw points. Some fault inside. Some fall outside. You count the frequency with which the points happen to be inside your set. And as long as you're throwing the points uniformly over the cube, then the probability of your complicated set is going to be the volume of that set. You estimate the probability by counting the frequencies with which you get points in that set, and so, by using these observed frequencies, you can estimate the volume. It turns out that these days, physicists and many engineers use methods of this kind quite often and in many important applications.

Summary:
Professor: We're describing interaction between the electromagnetic field and atoms. He says the problem of resonance can be "fixed" by adding an imaginary part to the energy level. Professor: I want to show you what are the tools to treat those infinity source divergences in a consistent and a systematic way. He explains how to calculate the Fourier transform of the time evolution operator to infinite orders, and how to sum up an infinite number of diagrammatic tricks and summation. The course is part of MIT OpenCourseWare, which offers free online classes. Fermi's golden rule is based on the idea of a real and imaginary part. The real part is this matrix element squared, but double sum. And the imaginary part has actually-- remember when we discussed the AC Stark shift. And such AC Stark shifts which appear as self energies, as energy shifts created by the state, this is nothing else than the famous Lamb shift. So what we've got now is a solution for the Fourier transform of the time evolution operator, which initially had a divergence. processes. OK, any last questions?

Summary:
David KAISER: In the last few class sessions, we were looking at some changes in high energy particle theory. And then in our most recent class session, we looked at some of the shifts within the fields of study. And today, we're going to focus on a kind of example of that new subfield, a relatively new sub field that's known as inflationary cosmology or simply cosmic inflation. So it's a framework for trying to understand the evolution of our universe over a huge expanse of time, increasingly using tools at the interface. lecture notes on the Canvas site which go into a little bit more detail of some of these parts from the lecture. So oftentimes, astronomers will describe the most salient features of our universe in terms of what they call large scale structure. It turns out that ordinary gravity-- even Newtonian gravity, let alone Einstein's fancier version that we looked at in class, general theory of relativity-- that these gravitational frameworks are sufficient to help us make sense of this hierarchy of scales, of structure across large distance scales. Astronomers like Edwin Hubble in Southern California were able to measure how rapidly distant galaxies were moving with respect to us. Hubble found this remarkable trend that the further away from us a given galaxy was, the faster it tended to be moving. The Hubble Space Telescope named in honor of Edwin Hubble, has been able to extend this to extraordinarily far distances, not just the ones that Hubble could access with his ground based telescope. And the basic trend holds. There's some interesting deviations. But the idea is nonetheless evidence consistent with our universe expanding. After the Second World War, new groups began coming back to these somewhat old questions. Some of the newer groups had experience with things like the Manhattan Project and in general were much better versed in things like nuclear physics than had been known even in Lemaitre's day. One of the most active groups soon after the war was based at the advanced-- excuse me-- the Applied Physics Laboratory. Here's a famous composite photograph. They're making a not so subtle gesture to the fact that Gamow was widely rumored to enjoy his drink. So his head is emerging from the vapors of Cointreau, of a liqueur. At early times in cosmic history, the universe should've been opaque. You literally wouldn't have been able to see anything because the mean free path of any given photon would be very, very short. At that moment, the average energy per photon or per elementary particle would fall so that you could actually begin to form stable atoms of hydrogen. After that time, when the temperature has fallen below about 10,000 Kelvin, photons are now free to travel large distances. They lose energy as the universe continues to expand. In 1948, physicists predicted as early as 1948 that there should be this remnant glow from the Big Bang. The idea was the whole universe is filled in the early times with very high energy particles that are at early, early times too high energy to form stable, electrically neutral atoms. The photons aren't just sitting in a bathtub of light, they're just moving through the overall size of space. So the idea was that there would be a point-like source of light coming from that direction of the sky. stuff per volume, the actual density of matter and energy per volume. If omega is larger than 1, you have more stuff for volume. You expect it's open or hyperbolic geometry. So far so good. Then Dicke plugged this quantity into Einstein's own equations. A universe should generically become more and more different from flat over time. And so this solution that looks like the Goldilocks solution, the spatially flat solution where you have just the right amount of stuff per volume is actually an unstable solution. Bob Dicke and James Peebles introduced the flatness problem in 1969. The universe started out being close to but not identically equal to flat at early times, they say. They say it should look nothing like spatially flat at later times. But it did look like a hyperbolic saddle or more and more like a closed sphere, they argue. The researchers say this is consistent with observations by the '60s, '70s and '80s. They also show that the universe was only 380,000 years old as opposed to nearly 14 billion. like circa 1980. He was not originally asking questions about the cosmos, but he was haphazardly encountering some of those questions, again, very much like Tony Zee around the same time. What Alan was interested in was in things like spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Higgs mechanism. He realized that this kind of feature could actually lead to a cosmologically distinct kind of evolution. If you have a time even briefly during which the energy density, the amount of stuff per volume gets stuck, then the energy could remain constant. That stretch of growth in the size of space will stretch exponentially. Planck collaboration using a satellite is that this parameter in our actual universe today is 1 to better than a percent level accuracy. This is a remarkable shift even over the course of 20 to 25 years, let alone since the days of Lemaitre and Hubble. If inflation happened, there should've been a very brief period before what had previously been called the Big Bang. So then it would at least be plausible there's at least now a causally self-consistent mechanism by which the universe could have similar conditions everywhere. why the universe is so messy is actually because Alan's been generating the mess in his own office, and it's expanded to cosmic scales. So if you want to study that part of today's lecture, it's probably the most important lesson, you'll ever take away. And I'll be glad to stay a bit longer if people have questions. Again, I'm sorry for running late. Feel free to drop off if you need. Any questions on that? The photos in Alan's office are on Canvas.

The Spartans had choices that they could take. They could either stay in the Pelop onnesus, or they could contest it in their power to control the entire Greek world in the east. Or they could have some control of the Aegean and the Hellespont.

Summary:
The coherent state has a simple definition, simple but subtle. It's an eigenstate of the annihilation operator, and it has a complex eigenvalue alpha. The person who popularized those states was Glauber, and he got amply rewarded for that. We are now using the coherent states to look at any other quantum state of the electromagnetic field, any statistical operator which describes photons by forming the diagram matrix element of the statistical operator with alpha. And now we realize that coherent states are not as wonderful as I believe. In quantum mechanics, you cannot measure x and p simultaneously. The three different ways are Q, P, and W. Q of alpha is a real probability, it's always positive. The other guys, P of alpha, can be positive or negative. And also, W of alpha can be negative or positive. All three have their advantages and disadvantages. So they all have pluses and minuses. But the reason why I picked for the course Q ofalpha is that it's a real. probability, and this has to be positive. the coherent state is now not this Gaussian. It doesn't have thisGaussian distribution as a course of probability. It's what you want-- what maybe some of you wanted to see-- oh, by the way, it's a delta function. The probability of the coherent state alpha has a delta. function peak at alpha, which is sort of nice. And the number state is not a ring of a finite radius. You would naively expect the energy is sharp. The square root of the energy's electric field, shouldn't it be sharp? And indeed, it issharp. Professor: "If you want to really appreciate the quantum character, you have to know the classic description first" "So the fluctuations of the intensity are usually expressed by the second order temporal coherence function" "Quantum mechanically, we will see that the g2 function is not necessarily larger than 1, it can be smaller than 1" "It's only possible if you have a truly non-classical state. That's actually an interesting-- you can see-- litmus test for the quantumness" Vladan Vuletan: Coherent states, as I've just shown you, are very classical. They've always a g2 function of 1. And attenuation is not changing it. So a coherent state with an expectation value of 1 photon is not a single photon. But of course, there are ways how you can get single photons. And this is, well, you start with single atoms. Namely, if you have a single atom in the excited state, it can emit only one photon. So that's a way how we can create non-classical states of light. The Hanbury Brown Twiss experiment was the first experiment which really looked at g2 functions correlations. It was the beginning of quantum optics and modern experiments with light. The classical limit is always a limit of high intensity, so at any given time, you have a ton of photons. If you put a light bulb into a cavity or couple the light from a light bulbs into a fiber, the light becomes spatially a single mode. That's the only way how you can distinguish a lightbulb from a laser beam. course practically, if you take a thermal source and filter it down to a single mode, you will be left with only a few photons. You cannot create an intense enough single mode light source unless you use stimulated emission. And that's a laser. So anyway, what Colin says is there are actually more different light sources that just the laser and the thermal light source. There are LEDs or semiconductor devices, which provide photons with interesting statistical properties. OK. We have to stop. I'll see you on Wednesday.

Summary:
This lesson will first dive into some signal Theory and then move on into things that we're more familiar with things like deconvolutions and using Transformers for next note prediction. The first thing we want to talk about is how can we sample and quantize a continuous time signal. We then go into some geometric signal Theory with Transformers and finally how how we can kind of generate sounds using these. The next thing we're going to kind oftalk about is changing forms. We'll talk about the SARS ADC algorithm and how it's used to convert digital signals to analog. um this is is kind of uh and and add add-on um to this presentation it uh doesn't really contribute exactly to what we're talking about but I thought this was incredibly cool um with one line in C you're able to to generate Melodies um which is incredibly coolUm yeah so please check it out if you if you guys have a chance uh the next thing we're going to talk about briefly is geometric signal Theory. Um and specifically you know what a projection is how it can be used to reconstruct signals and finally how that can tie in to reconstructing signals. familiar with perhaps in terms of how we can use those to reconstruct signals and ultimately how we Can use Those to generate audio right predict the best uh kind of next node um so looking at the next the next step here we want to use deep learning for reconstruction right where we are are reconstructing a low quality audio to high resolution audio right um and this is this is the kind of uh model framework um that we can used for this um you might notice it really closely resembles a unit which is something that we talked about during image segmentation. Transformers can help increase our sample of training data and generalize key scales and beats throughout a data set. A single song can be transformed into 12 songs of different Keys. The more data you have the better your model will be and the more generalizability you have in your Transformer the better it'll perform. Transformers will far outperform classical methods of of both computer vision and natural language processing. It's easier for machines to predict keys without flats and Sharps which has you know similar to what humans do. things a try yourself uh yeah thank you guys for tuning in have a good one. Things you might want to try yourself. Things that you may want to give a try. uh yeah. things you might be interested in trying yourself. things that you might like to give yourself. uhYeah. things a try yourselves. uh Yeah.

Summary:
Learn how the solar cell device converts sunlight, the input energy, to some usable output energy, which is in the form of electricity, typically, from a solar panel. Learn how to minimize the amount of light reflected or not absorbed into maximizing amount of life that's actually absorbed. Learn about the duality of light, or how to think about light as a particle, or alternatively, as a quantified particle. Use the weekly Newsquiz to test your knowledge of stories you saw on MIT OpenCourseWare. We need to understand how light gets absorbed inside of matter. Beer-Lambert's Law describes the interaction of light with the solar cell material. Light through the atmosphere, light the water, many other forms of optical absorption. We're going to learn what that is in a few lectures, of about 60%. And so first of all, we'll see what it's like, what the power of our--Yeah. So right now we're getting about 1.32 milliamps. Then as we keep increasing and put one layer of polyethylene, that drops to 0.75. by some sort of scattering intensity within the medium. We collapse the n and the sigma here into an alpha. That alpha is an absorption coefficient. If we increase the total thickness, we're going to decrease the total amount of light coming through via that exponential function. The alpha, obviously, is going to be very different for our atmosphere than it was for these little polyethylene sheets. Because the nature of the scattering and absorption processes are different for the atmosphere than they are for the material. We're going to look at two different materials, silicon and gallium arsenide. And we're Going to calculate the thickness necessary to absorb 90% of the incoming light at 550 nanometers. Did anybody manage to walk all the way through that calculation? TONIO BUONASSISI: I'm glad people are asking those questions. And then over the next few classes, we'reGoing to get to exactly what physical processes are going on. But I'm starting to get into the semester, so the energy level starts going down. There is a limit to how much we can trap light simply by modifying or corrugating the surfaces to enhance the optical path length. A gentleman by the name of Eli Yablonovitch, who's now a professor in Berkeley calculated these parameters I think back in 1982. He derived an expression for the maximum increase of the opticalPath length due to surface texturing, which was 4n squared. That might not sound like a whole lot, but if you're a $100 billion industry, 1% is a lot of money.

Summary:
JACK HARE: Let's do a little recap on electron cyclotron emission. We expect to have multiple different peaks, even from a single particle. These peaks are going to be occurring at frequencies. These tend to be in an optically thick regime. We can go back and we can use these measurements to identify three specific points inside our plasma that we've been using as part of this example. But, in general, you can get it all through the way through the plasma. temperature as a function of frequency. Then we can say, well, that frequency corresponds to a certain magnetic field. And then we can says that magnetic field corresponds to an spatial coordinate. This is a technique which will give us, by looking at the spectrum for lowish frequencies, the first or maybe the second harmonics of this cyclotron emission. We can work out what the temperature is as afunction of space. So this is why this is a powerful and popular diagnostic in MTF. want to understand in plasmas so that we can build an economically viable fusion reactor. Now, the fact that the noise is too high does seem like a big limitation. But there are some clever tricks that we play where we use correlations. And I'll talk now about what exactly these correlations are and how they provide us with information that allows us to get a signal out despite the overwhelming [INAUDIBLE]. So our setup here is borrowed from ASDEX Upgrade. And, in effect, I referred to Alex Creely's PhD thesis, which you can find online if you want more information. Many oscillations. And so, it will average out to 1 or something like that. So it's some DC offset that we can subtract off after. So all this is doing here is mixing the signal down so it gets to a regime that we could effectively digitize. Yeah, another question. Anyone know how micro splitters work? Looking at you? STUDENT: RF. JACK HARE: The answer I got is that you can actually collect from a very small region on the order of 100 microns. was RF, which I don't think is much more satisfying than my answer. So, yeah, there are circuits which will split microwaves. What they were actually doing with this system is all of these were very tunable. And so, if they wanted to look at turbulence in the edge or turbulence near the center, they could actually tune all their bandpass filters to do that. But this is getting way beyond what I was hoping to talk about on this. So let's get on to correlation ECE see what that does. situation where, at some point, your eddy has moved across, and these two are no longer correlated because the next two are correlated. So it-- yeah. I think we're reaching the limits of my knowledge. JACK HARE: I mean, there's no reason to believe that each of the fluctuations is the same size. So this is going to be a time-evolving system here.Yeah, exactly. Cool. Any other questions? Anything online? Now we're going to go to bremsstrahlung. here with the ions and electrons as point particles. There's a semi-classical approach where you start bringing in some quantum physics and treat, I think, the electron as a wave. And then there's a full quantum approach. What's remarkable about all of these approaches is they all give the same answer with just a very slightly different coefficient. So we get a small change in coefficient. The scalings are the same. So in some sense, although it's important to get the exact coefficient, it doesn't matter exactly which one of these techniques you use. This, therefore, has units of watts per hertz per meter cubed. And these constants are things like e, the electron charge, and the electron mass, and epsilon 0, and h bar, and c, all arranged in some way to make all the dimensions work. And so, this emissivity, as a function of photon energy, is a very simple function because it just decays exponentially with photon energy. So that is the spectrum coming out of a plasma that's emitting bremsstrahlung radiation here. at all frequencies, like a black body kind of spectrum here. That goes down to very low frequencies and goes up to very high frequencies. We're going to talk about lots of other effects which produce emissivity which is higher than the bremsstrahlung. So, I guess, you always need to worry about this, even if you managed to clear out all the impurities, you don't have any electron cyclotron emission. This is still going to be there. at synchrotron, yes. So cyclotron is when the particles are spiraling around the magnetic field. Synchrotrons are used as a source of X-rays for diagnosing many other things. So it's interesting in its own right, but I don't know whether people use it as a diagnostic. It depends mostly on the magnetic fields and the radius in a tokamak. But maybe there's a really clever diagnostic you can do, like fast particles or something like that. We're going to switch to a slightly quantum model of the atom. We have a range of different discrete energy levels that the electrons can occupy. These energy levels are labeled by the principal quantum number n. And, up here, infinity, this is ionization. If your electron gets this much energy, it becomes free again. And the energies of these levels are given by this unit, Ry, which is the Rydberg z squared of our ion over n squared. And that equation is going to be the photon that is emitted. related to the overlap integral between those with a dipole operator, the dipole operators being the thing that emits the photon in between them. So, yeah, you're right, there are inverse processes for all of these that will affect the spectra that you get. One use of this is a diagnostic called bolometry. It cares not at all about the detailed spectrum of what the emission is. It just wants to know how much power is being radiated by the plasma. We'll go into some ways of actually making some use out of all this stuff in a moment. This is balanced by conduction losses and what we, at the time, we assumed were bremsstrahlung losses, but in general could be any sort of radiative losses here. So, bolometry is focused on measuring the total power that's being emitted. And so, we can say, OK, well, that part of the plasma is clearly radiating too much. What can we do about it? So this is what bolometers are trying to measure. And you can be digitizing this as a function of time. This is often made out of gold. Gold is chosen because it absorbs all wavelengths relatively evenly. This thin layer of gold has been deposited on top of a substrate. And it's on the back of the substrate that you have your resistor. And depending on whether it is M or R, you either have this open to the plasma or you have a thick block some distance in front of it so it can't see the plasma. It's the heat capacity of the absorber, c, that goes into our previous equation. difference between those. neutron damage leads us to use much thicker substrates, which gives us a longer time response and so, therefore, a worse bolometer. So, ironically, the bolometers that will be used on [INAUDIBLE] are significantly worse than the bolometer used on existing devices. And I'm sure that [? Spark ?] will have exactly the same problem. Almost everyone in the world uses this design of bolometer that they pioneered on ASDEX Upgrade in the '80s. No one has come up with a better system yet.

Summary:
So, last time we were starting to talk about the sort of the general overview of what reinforcement learning involves. We introduced the notion [NOISE] of a model, a value, and a policy. Can anybody remember off the top of their head what a model was in the context of reinforcement learning? So what we're gonna do today is, sort of, um, build up for Markov Processes, up to Markov Decision Processes. And this build, I think, is sort of a nice one because it allows one to think about what happens in the cases where you might not have control over the world. before we do this let's think about how many policies there might be. So there are seven discrete states. In this case it's the locations that the robot. There are two actions. I won't call them left and right, I'm just going to call them a_1 and a_2. Then the question is how many deterministic policies are there and is the optimal policy for MDP always unique? So kind of right we just take like one minute or say one or two minutes feel free to talk to a neighbor. strict inequality if the old policy was suboptimal. So, why does this work? So, it works for the following reasons. And the next questions that might come up is so we know we're gonna get this monotonic improvement, um, so the questions would be if the policy doesn't change, can it ever change again? And is there a maximum number of iterations of policy iteration? Here iterations is i. It's a kind of how many policies could we step through? on sort of the contraction operator. So, if an operator is a contraction it means that if you apply it to two different things, you can think of these as value functions. The distance between them shrinks after, um, or at least is no bigger after you apply the operator compared to their distance before. So how do we prove this?

Professor: angular momentum is a set of operators that provide observables, things we can measure. He says they're particularly important for systems in which you have central potentials. Professor: If you have two energy for every system except for every energy except for 0, you have a problem. You know the problem, if you can uniquely characterize the states of the system, then you can learn more about the physics of this state, he says, and you can also know more about physics of a circle.

In order to do that, I basically have to do the integral. So here it is. We have psi of x and t. It's integral dk phi of k e to the ikx minus omega of kt. If you want to see the distortion, you have to keep that [INAUDIBLE]. We'll do that in a week from now. And then, you probably need to think a second. And you say, look. There's lots of things making it look like a difficult integral, but it's not as difficult as it looks. absolute value of a pure phase is that. psi at x minus d omega dk k0 t comma 0. The new norm of the wave at any time t looks like the wave looked at time equals 0 but just displaced a distance. If at time, psi had a peak when x is equal to zero, it will have a peak at time. And that corresponds to x equals to d omegadk times t, showing again that the wave has moved to the right by d Omega dk times T.

There are three common uses of a rotation matrix. The first is to represent an orientation. The second is to change the frame of reference of a vector. And the third is to rotate a vector or frame. To demonstrate these, I will use these three coordinate frames, representing the same space with different orientations. To help you visualize these frames in 3 dimensions, I'll use my handy tinkertoy frame. In the next video, we will learn how to represent the angular velocity of a frame.

Coded imaging is a co-design between how you capture the image and how you process the image. The concept of a position or superposition applies to all three types, shadows- or refraction- or reflection-based techniques. We'll see how-- we already have some projects that are inspired by biological vision. And I believe Santiago-- where's Santiago? Oh, yeah, his triangle-- the piston, kind of-- so some really great ideas. It is going to be very popular. When you take a blurry photo, a lot of the high-frequency details are lost. If you try to apply some deblurring, you'll get a result that looks like this. The culprit here is really this box function, which is equivalent to opening the shutter, opening the-- release your shutter button-- opening it open for exposure duration and closing it. So what if you change that? What if you changed that? And instead of keeping the shutter open for the entire duration, you open and close it in a carefully chosen binary sequence. It's actually preserving all frequencies in the image. frequencies-- they're all preserved. Of course, they're attenuated. It's not as high as-- it's not 1.0.0, it's reduced. Maybe it's 0.1 or so. So there is still some hope to recover this photo back from this because, in the denominator, we will not have seen. This is a very simple idea. Instead of keeping the shutter open for the entire duration and getting a well-exposed photo, the shutter is open for only half of the time. And that's your 1010 inquiry. CNN's Ravi Agrawal is a senior producer at CNN.com. He is the founder and CEO of a company that uses artificial intelligence to improve camera technology. He says the technology can be used to blur images based on distance and speed of objects. He shows how the technology could be used in a mobile phone app to help people figure out license plate numbers of cars and cars on the street. The company is based in New York and has been around since the 1970s. System is based on an open-source code called 7-of-7. It was developed by a team of engineers at MG Edge. The code can be used to change the aperture of a camera. It can also be used as a way to change a camera's focus and image quality. It's going to look like a code that is like the RASKARASARAS system, which is a 7-by-7 mask with an aperture code of 7 by 7. In 1D, Fourier transform is flat; in 2D, it's a broadband code. Fourier transforms of a square aperture, a traditional one, and a square transform, it will look something like this. If we're placing a broadbandcode, certainly we have an opportunity to recover all the information. If all I wanted to do was create a photo from which I can deblur to get sharp photo, why do I need to think about all this theory? RAMESH RASKAR: It's just traditional signal processing. motion case, we had to know how much the motion is. The size of the blur is dependent on what? AUDIENCE: Belt. RAMESH RASKAR: The belt. But not just depth-- depth from the plane of focus, right? So that's an extra parameter you would estimate somehow. Maybe you can use a rangefinder or something like that, or just a software. There are methods you can employ. We said, OK, let me try to refocus. When it comes into sharp focus, my edges, that must be the right depth. I said, by the time I come tomorrow morning, I'll find a really good code. And I came back next morning. Nothing had happened. I waited all day. It was still running. And it never came out of that. So 2 the 52 is pretty challenging. But even if you use a cluster, it's still a pretty big number. So you can do some approximation. So [? harder ?] [? mark ?] code, which we learned about a few weeks ago or so-called broadband codes, they all have polynomial solutions. filter to the beginning of the signal. This particular filter is actually not circular, but it's linear. So when you apply the filter here, when you start applying the filter at the end of the image, you don't go back to the front. It turns out, for circular convolution, the match is very clean and beautiful and smoother course work. Or for linear convolution,. there is no good mechanism. So we came up with our own code called RAT code, R-A-T, which is after three quarters. Raskar: Compressed sensing or compressed imaging comes up when you want to take something that is much higher resolution but recover it in a compressed way. He says a group at Rice University has been able to measure the z-dimension down to about 10 nanometers. Raskar says the idea is to take one single photo and turn it on and off to get a million-pixel image, which can then be used to reconstruct neuronal structures in three-dimensional form. The concept is mathematically easy to explain, he says. which is how to write a paper and wishlist for photography.

Summary:
Prof. Clark: Middle class was a form of self-identity that was constructed in the way being a worker was constructed, or being a noble. When you see Daumier or you see Delacroix's famous, Liberty Leading the People, and you see the bourgeois, there with his top hat, he's dressed in a bourgeois uniform like this. That emerges out of the bourgeois century. The middle classes started dressing like this in the nineteenth century, dark with a little bit of color. Once we've got an increase in the wealth of the middle classes, then you wanted the political power. times, as you know, in the French Revolution--;the French revolutions, and in the revolutions of 1848. These folks are here, too. People are always dumping all over them needlessly. I will give you some example. If you've ever read the great French novelist--;he was paid by the word, but Balzac is really the novelist of the bourgeoisie. When he describes Paris and the seventeen to nineteen percent of the population who are increasingly living in the western part of Paris, he describes it as a jungle. Daumier is the greatest caricaturist in the nineteenth century. He captures the prevailing mood in much of Europe in that money, more than blood. The bourgeoisie didn't kiss and hug a lot, but he's got his hand draped rather daintily on the old guy's arm. He's not about to embrace him and give him a big kiss on each cheek. One day all of this stuff will be his, if he plays his cards right. Love could still be something, but economic relationships were still essentially, less so for the middle classes than ordinary relationships. birthday, papa." You didn't take time out to celebrate a birthday if you were an ordinary person having to get to the fields at 4:00 in the morning in the summer, or going to work during the day. There's a whole notion, and here again this would probably fit rather awkwardly into the birth control description, but there's this whole sense of being prepared that emerges with the middle class. The bourgeoisie, the middle classes, and this is particularly true of Germany and France, and of England, too. until you have universal male suffrage, by how much taxes you paid and how much property you own. Property reflects one's belief in one's own social worth. No longer was it the worth of blood. So, they formed these national guards, particularly after revolutions and after 1848, or after 1830. For a while they go march around. But these are mainly there to protect them against the workers. Should one day all of these people try to rise up, climb up this ladder, you'll be down there to stomp on their fingers or to shoot them down. Transnonain, where this happened in the center of Paris, simply disappeared. It didn't quite disappear from the collective memory of people thinking about Parisian things. In conclusion, the middle classes extremely vary. They have a common material culture. They share a belief in achieved status, as measured by the amount of property that you had. They want a collective voice in decisions. Have a good weekend. See you on Monday. Back to Mail Online home. back to the page you came from.

In automotive design Dynamics plays a very important part because it's not rigid body Dynamics it's a bunch of rigid bodies with springs the Springs are called starts with an S suspens suspensions right and there's a trade-off between how comfortable the ride is and how tightly the car handles. In a car cruise control puts in this artificial foot essentially on the throttle and it tries to maintain the speed at a constant level right so we're doing Dynamics end of the course we're going to solve the dynamical equations dou4. In this lecture we're going to introduce to you the concept of angular moment and angle momentum. This is the stepping stone the link to rigid bodies then we'll do a problem. There's no class next Monday and we posted the solution to that problem from class. I won't have officers today only because you don't want to hear me Babel I'm really sick. I might go to like a Monday off M um like later on a Monday or maybe Wednesday later or something like that. Would you prefer it not be midday Wednesday? point right so let us say I could have done it around o but here's the deal when you do angular momenta it's very useful to pick some point that's convenient you'll see this a lot right if I'm trying to calculate the angular momentum of that door I prefer to do it about the axis for various reasons right forces vanish all sorts of cool stuff happens so I need to tell you which point I just want to to pick a random point and do it that that way so let's say it's Q so what's the angularmomentum of particle of Point p and by the way let's assume the mass is m  what's the angle of momentum quick say it h lvm yeah. A lot of MIT grads old friends work all over the world very important positions around the world for example the foreign minister of the new British government is an MIT grad okay milbrand Benjamin Netanyahu who might end up being the next president of Israel MIT grad kofan MIT grad right but one of my friends Works in a congressional he she helps Congressional analyze things from a physics point of view so you know when Katrina occurred someone asked if it would be possible to change the temperature in the when a hurricane approaches to dissipate the temperature. call this Theta the initial length is L one and the initial velocity is we'll call it a scalar because this is how I'm defining the problem of V1 when we actually solve it we might have to define a vector okay. As the thing's going around this person is going to pull the string down and as it kind of goes around it's going to spiral in and end up it's a new length L2 and the question is what is V2 going to be okay. There is no torque on this particle at any point in time it's just a very long way to say listen things going in circles and the only force is radial if we take a cross product it's going to vanish. In a lot of situations that pesky correction term doesn't make a difference you just need to be careful that it exists. The angular momentum is conserved because this goes to zero which means d by DT of ah p q is equal Z and what that tells you is understood. would have to do one of two things I would have had to either calculate this term or calculate or make you know make my frame attach it to the truck. I've just done it in a very precise way okay so in the end there's no surprise the whole point is to show you they could be surprises but be careful any questions about this all right snap quiz in the next 3 minutes I want you to calculate for me the final velocity literally 3 minutes because I have toDo the dumbbell problem. The question I ask now is how does this thing behave so let's examine this first of all how do I parameter or to use the more technical term what nonstandard coordinates do I need to describe the configuration of this dumbbell. If instead of a rigid bar if I had a string connecting them what would the kinematic constraint be less than equal to to R right but in this case it's a rigidbar so it's equal to R to R all right by the way just so you know if in rigid bodies you can make an equality constraint um in non- rigid in if it were a string it's an inequality constraints. different you'll find out later I would have picked the center of mass which would not have been the geometric Center Center okay but you don't know why so I can't tell you why. I just did some slate of hand and I made the masses equal all right a lot of terms cancel out that's the only difference I could still have by the way I could have picked a point on that line anywhere there would still be reasonable generaliz coordinates there wouldStill be three just the math is easier that's it okay. First we will do some free body diagrams then we'll figure out the accelerations of both particles. We'll write f is equal to Ma and we have differential equations we'll make sure we have as many equations as we have unknowns and we'll the do all right so from a free body diagram point of view I'm not going to do it right now but very simply there are each bar applies a force on the part on the particle I'll do it later on because I want to the kinematics first so I'm breaking my own rule. stick if I have something at the end of a stick can I apply like a you know does it only have to be a force inwards right. Next week we'll pick up on this and essentially what we'll do is I'll do the three body diagram. Define angular acceleration and moment of inertia and a more General sense okay so let's stop here because we are over time. CL you I mean you're getting that's right so there are a couple of ways to interpret this okay it's a massless rod and I'm invoking the strong form of Newton's third law.

Summary:
Differentiable programming is closely related to deep learning. It allows you to build up an increasingly more sophisticated model without losing track of what's going on. So let's begin with our familiar example, the three layer neural network. We're going to see a lot of these box diagrams which are going to represent functions that we can reuse and have a nice interpretation. To fix this problem, we introduce convolutional neural networks which is a refinement of fully connected neural networks. So here is an example of ConvNet in action. Play with ConvNets, you can actually click here for Andrej Karpathy's excellent demo. You can actually create and train ConvNet in your browser. So Conv takes an image and the image is going to be represented as a volume which is a collection of matrices, one for each channel, red, green, blue. Each matrix has the same dimensionality as the image, height by width. And what the Conv is. going to do is it's going to compute another volume of a slightly different size, usually the height and width of this volume is going. to be equal or maybe slightly smaller. going to slide a little max operation over every 2x2 or 3x3 region. So the max over these four numbers is going to be used to build this [INAUDIBLE] and so on. If you want to go into the details, you can check out this demo or you can learn more in 231. But again, I want to highlight that there's these two modules. One for detecting patterns and one for aggregating, to kind of reduce the dimensionality. And with these two functions along with FeedForward, now we can define AlexNet. In NLP, words are discrete objects and neural networks speak vectors. So whenever you're doing NLP with neural nets, you first have to embed words, or more generally, tokens. There's a lot of processing that needs to happen and it's hard to kind of specify in advance. A SequenceModel is going to be something that takes a sequence of input vectors and produces a corresponding sequence of output vectors where each vector in this sequence is a process with respect to the other elements. I'm going to talk about two implementations of the sequence models. One is recurrent neural networks and one is transformers. Self attention takes a sequence of input vectors and then it's going to output the same sequence of output vectors where the first vector is, I'm going to stick x1 into the query vector for y and compute the attention. So that's an attention mechanism. You can think about this as a sequence model that just takes input sequence and contextualizes the input vectors into output vectors. Layer normalization and residual connections are really kind of technical devices to make the final neural network easier to train. encourage you to consult the original source if you want kind of the actual, the full gory details. Another thing I haven't talked about is learning any of these models. It's going to be using some variant of stochastic gradient descent, but there's often various tricks that are needed to get it to work. But maybe the final thing I'll leave you with is the idea that all of differentiable programming is built out of modules. Even if you kind of don't understand or I didn't explain the details, I think it's really important to pay attention to the type signature of these functions.

Summary:
Professor Amy Hungerford: Today it is my very great privilege and pleasure to introduce Andrew Goldstone, a TF in this course. Andrew is a fourth-year student in the Ph.D. program in English, and he is writing a dissertation on the autonomy of the work of art in modernism. In preparation for that, for next week I'd like you to finish the novel and then read his essay, "On a Novel Entitled Lolita" It should be bound at the back of your book. T.S. Eliot's "Gerontion" is a spoof of Nabokov's "Humbert" Eliot says poems should be autotelic, that means they should be an end unto themselves. Eliot in some ways comes very close to the kind of ideas about art that Nabokovsky holds. Eight of the eight features of literary modernism that are all important to Nabokova are: obsession with art's autonomy, the idea that art is its own law, that it has no other purpose than its own. Vladimir Nabokov's novel, The Metamorphosis, is based on Proust's "In Search of Lost Time" In the novel, Humbert and Lolita meet in a fairy tale, a crude pun on the term "fairy" tale. The author's relationship to the modernist past is not just the burlesque that he visits on Eliot, says David Frum. Frum: The danger for Nabokovsky is that he will fall too in love with something too like himself. A list of names leads up to this aesthetic sensation, the revelation of a poem. The ordinary materials of life become the basis for a kind of artistic achievement. Even the ordinary names are kind of plants, because almost every name on this list comes back elsewhere in the book. McFate is the icon of the difference between the realistic world of Joyce and the already artificial, already aestheticized world of this novel. No one was ever really named McFate. McFates are a parody of real. Nabokov took a narrative of real events and twisting it into something that makes a kind of sense, taking fate and making it McFate. The thing that stands for randomness in this book, the thing that looks like ordinary detail, has already been arranged to give you artistic pleasure. The artificial has taken the place of the real here, and this novel really reminds you of that all the time. The point is that this clichéd life of mowing the lawn and washing the car is that they're all wrong. the fear that it's too like what he wants to do. But the main point here to think about is that feeling of damage. On page 152, evocation of the landscape: By a paradox of pictorial thought, the average lowland North American countryside had at first seemed to me something I accepted with a shock of amused recognition. "Inutile loveliness" is kind of the key word of Nabokov's novel, and it's the source of the most appealing writing. technique, and he says the novel has as its only purpose to provide aesthetic bliss. So, a European artist actually appears again there, with Claude Lorrain, but kind of made strange: given that knight's move, given a new twist. So--instead of familiar, incorporated into this profoundly strange, vast landscape that gets Humbert's most appealing rhetoric--the rhetoric of an exile. But, I don't want you to think that this just means everything's okay. Of course, everything is not okay. Nabokov tried to become an American writer, as Nabokov says he's doing: trying to invent America, trying to bridge the gap between Russian and English. He translated Lolita back in to Russian later on, and he added a second afterword where he said: That wondrous Russian tongue that, it seemed to me, was waiting for me somewhere, was flowering like a faithful springtime behind a tightly locked gate whose key I had held in safekeeping for so many years, proved to be nonexistent.

NORVIN RICHARDS: Today is phonetics, which means that today we begin making funny sounds at each other. One standard way of talking about different kinds of speech sounds is to talk about where in the vocal tract the flow of air can get obstructed. So for example, there are what are called bilabial sounds. These are sounds which are made with both lips. And so that's what you do for the sounds that are at the beginnings of words like "paint" and "bath," and "mouth," and well, "wipe" in mind? STUDENT: No. NORVIN RICHARDS: Oh, OK. We'll get to "r," eventually. People investigate this kind of thing in all kinds of ways. These days, people do a lot of MRIs. There are charts of all of the sounds that we're going to talk about plus many more together with MRIs of the insides of people's mouths making these sounds so that you can see the anatomy. You won't just have to think about it.  phonologist: "cat" and "dog" end in sounds that differ in voicing. "z" is voiced and that "s" is voiceless. "v" is more-- there's more air, I guess, than "f" or "v," but it's not the same. If you whisper "safe," and "save," you have the feeling that you can hear the difference between them. "F" is slower, I think my mouth is opening slower, so yes? So yes? English has a very large number of vowels and a not-very-good system for writing them. One way of classifying vowels is in terms of height. For "ee," your tongue is tense. And then for "ooh," where does it go? It moves, right? So you aren't just rounding your lips and leaving your tongue where it was. In fact, that's why when you take photographs of people, you have them say something with an "ee" vowel in it, like "cheese"

Aristotle was born 384,15 years after the trial of Socrates. He was sent by his father to go to college. Unlike most of you, Aristotle did not spend four years at the Platonic Academy. He remained attached to it for the next 20, until the death of Plato. Unlike his intellectual godfather, Socrates, who wrote nothing but conversed endlessly, Aristotle wrote disciplined and thematic treatises on virtually every topic. He collected constitutions, 158 of them in all, from throughout the ancient world. the preserve of the few, of a minority capable of sharing in the administration of justice and in the offices of a city. It seems to be a very elite teaching. Would you agree? Unappealing to us, perhaps, for that reason, very contrary to our intuitions and the way we have been brought up. But before we dismiss Aristotle's account as insufferably inegalitarian and elitist, we have to ask a difficult question. What else is Yale, but an elite institution intended to educate, morally and intellectually, potential members of a leadership class?

If this was like a streetcar, don't you think it would apply to that as well? So I think the fact that it's a personal vehicle, I think it's important. So the key in this is, describe the concept using few words precisely, but to set it apart from neighboring concepts. What about Rolex Center? It's a single-layer building with multiple straw used as a library for people to meet and study. built. The first thing you do is understand where is the value-- the stakeholders and the stakeholder analysis and the requirements definition. And then you interpret and incorporate some of the needs into goals, which become requirements. And so the goals then are an instrument of the primary delivery value delivering process, which is your value proposition. To then actually deliver that value you need to design the product, the product system, and understand the operand, the thing that is being operated on or transformed by the primary value delivery process. EPFL's Olivier De WECK talks about how to reduce food spoilage rate. He says the key is to think in an abstract way and then pick a specific concept. He explains how bears use fat to transform it into fat and store it in their bodies. The process is similar to conserving grapes, beer and wine, he says. The concept was developed by EPFL's design and creativity unit. The project is now being developed by a company in the UK, and is expected to be completed by the end of 2014. A cooler has the chilling function, and then the sub-functions when we zoom in are holding the food, exchanging the heat between the food and the environment, reducing the heat load, interfacing, connecting, powering, regulating the temperature, et cetera. And then on the form side, the cooler itself is very simple structurally. And you can go very detailed here, even for something very simple like a cooler. One question and then we'll talk about the refrigerator and how it's different in a minute. is concept generation. So take the requirements and think creatively about how these requirements could be fulfilled. And then once you have several concepts, you've got to select among them, which we'll talk about next week. It's about starting with the operand. What is the thing that the beneficiary, the stakeholder cares about, and how do we transform that? Concept then elaborate these into architectures that have form function and structural complexity. And the goodness of an architecture is really a pretty complex concept. System design and management program is a full-year program. It's essentially focused on decomposition, which is an important part of architecting. So let me talk about methods and tools for concept generation. So what are different ways of stimulating or organizing creativity? And what I'm showing you here is-- that's essentially a mind map of how to think about the creativity space. And then we have this whole area here, which I'm going to mention, but we're not going to do as part of the class. There's got to be a driving question for the brainstorming session. There's an ideal group size, and it says 5 to 10 here, but I should probably revise this to be-- what do you think? 7 plus minus 2. The idea is to produce a large amount of ideas and then at some point, maybe 30 to 60 minutes, Brainstorming session that last four hours is probably really good and then the rest is kind of shot and there's not a lot of new ideas coming. Leonardo was a head of his time in many ways. So he's really been identified as an exceptional individual. How to Think Like Leonardo, Seven Steps to Genius, is a book on creativity. The seven da Vincian principles of creativity are here in Italian. They include curiosita, lifelong quest for learning. Dimostratzione, testing your knowledge through experience, trying things out. Sensazione, continual refinement of the senses. Mastering ambiguity, paradox, uncertainty. Arte/Scienza is the whole brain thinking, left-right brain. Corporalita, balance of body and mind. or an architecture. So the key decisions are the rows. There are factors in the rows, and then for each row you think about what are the number of possible alternatives for doing this. And then you enumerate all possible combinations. And the big challenge with this, of course, is if you have many factors, you could generate many infeasible architectures. Not all these combinations are actually feasible. So that's architecture enumeration, and there's different ways of doing this at different layers of abstraction. A3 assignment A3 asks students to come up with new ways of brainstorming. Students must use mind maps, morphological matrices, and architecture enumeration. The assignment is due in two weeks and will be graded on a scale of 1-10. The final assignment will be given to students at the end of the month and the results will be published in the next few days. For more information on the assignment, visit the assignment website. It is open to students from all over the world and can be downloaded from the assignment site.

Summary:
then we are going to continue with the second part of the lecture today which focuses on the problem what actually happens if the gaussian assumption that i have about my constraints doesn't hold. As you will see in some small examples having this outliers in your optimization problem is something which hurts dramatically which actually screw up your solution. Already a few outliers can lead to a environment model which is completely unusable for doing any navigation task so where the geometry of what you computed doesn't fit to the real world geometry anymore and one of the questions actually how to handle that. done you know he said oh damn i can't do that what would be the ugliest trick that you can do in order to make that work even worse no that's not quite what you're going to do i mean the sum is kind of the the the bad thing what can i do with the sum instead of the sum i can i can get rid of thesum in some nice way sorry oh the integral of some to the integral actually makes our life typically worth um so that's that's going what's going to fly. and flatter and flatter gaussian distribution the further the point is actually away there's also one technique which you can find which is also quite easy to implement because you just need to compute the scaling factor and multiply that with your information matrix for every constraint also something you can do quite efficiently. If you have constraint which introduce large errors these are these outliers this can actually screw up the optimization when computing the minimal error configuration. There are different ways of uh kind of row function that we can actually in there and then we're then trying to minimize. here that by changing this function you can't get much better behaviors kind of deciding which function to use for the underlying optimization problem is not on it's not always an easy and easy choice so this requires some expert knowledge some good intuition on coming up with the way with one of those functions. Next week which is the last week of the term i will briefly talk about front ends and give kind of a short summary on what typical front ends exist obviously we're not going to all the details as we did that here.

Summary:
John Stuart Mill is the principle expositor of neoclassical utilitarianism. The rights-utility synthesis signals that we're looking for an attempt to put together both a commitment to utilitarian efficiency that's grounded in science on the one hand, and respect for individual rights that's grounding in the workmanship ideal on the other hand. At the same time, more or less, there were very important developments in moral philosophy that I just want to alert you to. The doctrine that I'm mentioning here is the doctrine that would come to be called emotivism.  neoclassical economists wanted to understand the behavior of markets. They wanted to be able to more precisely to predict what prices were going to be in markets. Pareto, Marshall, and Edgeworth, and others who were in their circle, thought you could do this just with ordinal utility. So moving from cardinal to Ordinal utility is going to turn out to have huge ideological consequences, which I'm going to unpack for you towards the end of today's lecture. All All Prof: These indifference curves cannot cross. Can anybody tell us why? Why can't they cross? Wait for the mic. Student: Because at the intersection they should have the same utility. Prof: So you've got a kind of contradiction on your hands, is that right? Student: Yeah. Professor: Okay, and just to spell out the contradiction more emphatically--I think you basically made the point. So we have a distribution here, okay? Now what Pareto said, he said, "Let's draw a line north-south through the status quo" which the radical fangs of classical utilitarianism have been ripped out and it is now a doctrine that is very friendly to whatever status quo happens to be generated in a market system. So it ceases to be this radically redistributive doctrine, and in the process imports into utilitarianism a very robust, some would say, hyper-robust doctrine of individual rights. We'll see how that played out in political theory when we come to look at John Stuart Mills' harm principle next Monday.

Summary:
HONG LIU: Today, we talk about chiral fermions. He says the Dirac equation requires, actually, psi to have four components. But there are two ways to reduce it, and one is called the Majorana fermion, he says. HONG LIu: You don't need four components to be able to transform under Lorentz. You just need a smaller unit, OK? He says this tells you that at least two components already can transform. HONG LIU: We already knew all along that two components is enough for Lorentz transformation. How do we actually know all along? AUDIENCE: Is it the massless particle? HONG LIu: Yeah, exactly. So it is the mass which is the key. So, now, we have shown in this particular representation of gamma matrices, for this particular choice of gammaMatrices, and then the psi transform block diagonally. But then we also said, but, now,. consider a different choice of GammaMatrices. And then this property will not hold. HONG LIU: So, by definition, discrete symmetries are symmetry, which don't have continuous parameters. So for a complex scalar field, then this is no longer a discrete symmetry because, remember, we can rotate phi by a phase. You can exchange phi to phi star, OK? It's a complex conjugation. So often, this will give a symbol-- T, T-- and heuristically we can think of phi as creating one particle and one antiparticle.

Summary:
The best-case scenario for expansionary fiscal policy is when there are lots of underemployed resources in the economy. By increasing spending, the federal government can try to counteract falling aggregate demand. In one scenario, government spending doesn't have to be as large as the fall in "C," or consumption, to counteract the recession. That's because of the multiplier effect. But, as always, shifting lines on a graph is much more important than the long-run effects. easier than shifting around real resources in a multi-trillion dollar economy. Fiscal policy has many implementation challenges, and we'll turn to these next. You're on your way to mastering economics. Make sure this video sticks by taking a few practice questions.

Sarah thread sterner shows you how to wear and take off a mask. She explains how to determine which part of the mask is the front versus the back. She also shows how to mold the nose piece of the face mask with the finger tips of both hands. Finally, she shows you the best way to remove the mask by placing it over your ears and pulling it under your chin when removing the mask it's important to remember that the front is considered contaminated so remove it with the fingertip and then perform hand hygiene.

Summary:
In this lecture, we're going to talk about how neurons function and how researchers are able to control that function in order to modify behavior. Then we'll talk about synapses and how synapses function to communicate between neurons. And this is going to involve also sort of understanding how certain antidepressants, like Prozac, work. And then we'll end by talking about how researchers did this experiment to wake up the mouse. It all starts with something that I told you about at the beginning of the semester, which is that the plasma membrane separates distinct compartments. you to test the function of the neuron in the behavior of an organism. So, in this case, this mouse, the light is shined into its brain, and they're testing a specific type of neuron that is involved in arousal of the mouse. And it's going to wake up right now. There it goes. It woke up. You see now its muscle activity is going, OK? So you can test thefunction of specific nerve cells using this approach, and it's because you have a light-sensitive sodium channel.

Summary:
In this problem, we're going to be dealing with a variation of the usual coin-flipping problem. But in this case, the bias itself of the coin is going toBe random. And we're told that the expectation of this bias is some mu and that the variance of the bias isSome sigma squared. And what we'll be asked is find a bunch of different expectations, covariances, and variances. We'll see that this problem gives us some good exercise in a few concepts, a lot of iterated expectations. An art that you learn through more practice. But one good rule of thumb is, when you have kind of a hierarchy or layers of randomness, it's useful to condition on the layer above where that is, in this case, the random bias of the coin itself. Once you condition on that layer above, that makes the next level much simpler. Because you kind of assume that you know what all the previous levels ofrandomness are, and that helps you calculate what the expectation for this current level.
