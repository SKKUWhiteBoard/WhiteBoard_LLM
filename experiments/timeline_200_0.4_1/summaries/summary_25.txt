Bolek Wyslouch: How do you convert a given physical system with all the forces, et cetera, into some sort of fixed form, fixed type of notation? Bolek: We will work on two, again, simple physical systems, one that consists of two pendula driven by forces of gravity, each of them. And we will discuss various interesting-- even though the system is very simple, just two masses, a spring, a little bit of gravity on top of that. could put it with me some spaceship, and go to a place where the gravity is different, right? Why not? So what would happen? So if gravity changes, then basically what will happen is both this term and that term will change. So let's try to see what happens on the Moon. It's a little bit not completely clear what's going on, but you see, actually the motion is kind of a little strange. Look at the red one. The red one is stopping. Then it's going halfway out. It looks kind of messy, doesn't it? center mass of the system or just one of the two --? BOLESLAW WYSLOUCH: This one, I think, this one is justOne of them. Actually, the one-- on the difference-- it normally doesn't matter. What matters this is the frequency and how these move to the other. So let me now talk about this thing, which is called beat phenomenon, because when you look at the motion of one of those objects, or the difference between them or whatever. sort of early on, to instead of, so far, when we talked about pendula, we describe their motion in terms of motion of number 1. It turns out we can rewrite the equation into some sort of new variables, where, so-called normal coordinates, where you'll simultaneously describe both of them and then kind of mix them together to have a new formula. So you do change of variables. So instead of keeping track of x1 and x2 independently, you define something which I called u1, which is simply x1 plus x2, and I define u2,which is x1 minus x2.
