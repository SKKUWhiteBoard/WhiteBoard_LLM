GILBERT STRANG: Differential equations is the big application of calculus. He says you really do need to know basic derivatives. The derivative of e to the x, he says, solves the equation dy dt equals y plus q of t. Strang: You can create the derivatives of an enormous array of functions using the key rules. The product rule fg prime plus gf prime. The quotient rule. The chain rule. And above all, the derivative of this-- of that chain of functions, that composite function.
