The EM algorithm is an unsupervised version of k-means GMM. In GMM, you guess randomly an assignment of every point to the cluster, the probability. You guess where they're probabilistically linked, that is, what's the probability of these points belong to cluster one, this point belongs to cluster two. And then once you have that, you then solve some estimation problem that looks like a traditional supervised learning. The decomposition is quite important. And we're going to try and kind of abstract that away. a bowl-shaped function, right? Now, no matter how I pick the points-- and clearly, I should really only have to worry about picking on the edge. So this is a convex function. This is not convex. And intuitively, the reason I drew these shapes is that convexity for shapes probably makes more intuitive sense, 2D shapes. So we're going to-- we'll actually prove this, I think, why not? Sounds like a fun thing to prove.
