Professor Steven Smith: I want to look at two sets of issues. One is Locke's theory of the constitutional state, particularly focusing on the role of the executive, vis-a-vis the legislative branch of government. The other is thinking about Locke and the American regime and the current state of political philosophy, modern contemporary American political philosophy. Smith: Locke doesn't endorse necessarily one particular form of government from any other. He is an advocate of what we have come to call limited government, of constitutional government. The many faces of modernity are working themselves out. We are but a moment in the kind of comprehensive self-dissatisfaction that is modernity. A return to Lockeanism, in many ways, is not so much a cure for the pathologies ofmodernity. I would suggest that those pathologies are themselves already rooted in the pathologically of Locke. I will end on that sober note and encourage you to take Rousseau's advice about loving one's country seriously on Tuesday.
