The principles of baking show us how to test the theory of cold fermenting. We'll make three breads one with the brief mint and two without one of the breads without the bereavement will be bulk fermented in the fridge for 24 hours. The third one will be made with a brief mint which will be left for 12 hours to ferment then it'll be mixed into the main dough. The main comparison I want to do today is between the two breads which will take the same amount of time to make. comparison for yourself then tell us of your results you might be surprised. What do you think of my test and my results have you ever tried something like this before do you use preference when cold fermenting let me know down in comments.

Callback fermentation beats bereavement in every way it develops far more flavor it makes the crust crispier and the crumb most substantial and it simplifies the process because we don't have to make a separate thing. When it comes to cold fermentation versus brief mint there is no better method what is better is up to the use slightly less yeast in the dough that was made with the bravement and that was to compensate for the amount of yeast coming from the bereavement itself as it rises it multiplies.
