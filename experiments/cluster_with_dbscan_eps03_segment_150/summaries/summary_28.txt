Ambiguity or not it's kind of if the uncertainty lips of speakers need to seen all that area to make this is no that's the only place where I actually can match and about the special clustering technique for the original paper where you find all the information here's the work back in also recognizing places using spectral clustered local matches. This is exactly the approach that I presented here and actually a couple of the slides that I use in here or of the images material at least comes from a tin Olsen. okay so welcome to the last lecture of this course here in this winter term and what we discussed so far in the course were mainly the so-called backends or optimization engines or probablistic estimation techniques. Today I would like to give a very very of course brief short overview about front ends and one important aspect inside successful front ends on how to determine if a constraint is likely to be a correct one so we are still interested in avoiding to add roam constraints although we've learned that we there are techniques which can deal with outliers in the data Association.
